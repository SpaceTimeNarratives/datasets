Much beauty as well as grandeur is exhibited in the approach, which partakes of the rural and forest-like species of scenery, but somewhat ornamented, till it terminates in a spacious park, where a profusion of wood and water appearsmost judiciously disposed, and the two grand fronts of the house burst on the sight with almost unequalled magnificence. This great pile of building exhibits a happy spe-cimen of the architecture prevailing in two different ages, which yet sufficiently correspond with each other to please the eye when united.

The view from the windows of this noble room isenchantingly striking, commanding the whole vale wth its opposite hills, abundantly clothed with wood and villages, and decorated with several ornamental buildings, while the verdant lawn of the park sloping gradually to a great sheet of water, so dispersed as to assume the form of a serpentine river, and surrounded by noble groves of oaks, descending in each side of the house, strongly contrasts the wilder features of the distant prospect.

As soon as you have passed the body of the church, the sea opensto the left, and you trace the River Lune through several meanders to its mouth; further on the left, the flat country through which we had passed is extended; and on theright, Peel castle appears just raised above the level of the water, from which the hills of Furness gradually ascend. The whole view changes on passing round the church, and entering the contiguous field. All the hills of Furness appear in front, beyond which the lofty mountains of Westmoreland and Cumberland, in two distinct and craggytracts, seem to contend with the very skies for pre-emi-nence. Turning to the right, you see a very elegant bridge of five elliptic arches crossing the Lune, which passeswith a bold sweep under the hill on which you stand; and further to the right, the whole town descends into the vale in a great curve from the castle, while several high barren hillsrise grandly in front. I passed from hence, over an old bridge of four arches, to the new bridge, which now presents a grand access to the town from the north.","file_id":"1795_a","plnames":[["Lancaster",386,395],["River Lune",863,873],["Peel",1009,1013],["Furness",1095,1102],["Furness",1225,1232],["Westmoreland",1286,1298],["Cumberland",1303,1313],["Lune",1493,1497]],"geonouns":[["country",41,48],["ground",154,160],["sea",256,259],["hills",283,288],["church",427,433],["castle",438,444],["hill",456,460],["sea",471,474],["walls",631,636],["castle",644,650],["church",684,690],["tower",726,731],["church",811,817],["sea",823,826],["mouth",906,911],["country",943,950],["castle",1014,1020],["water",1064,1069],["hills",1086,1091],["church",1165,1171],["field",1201,1206],["hills",1216,1221],["mountains",1273,1282],["bridge",1449,1455],["hill",1539,1543],["town",1600,1604],["vale",1623,1627],["castle",1654,1660],["bridge",1749,1755],["bridge",1783,1789],["town",1832,1836]],"pos_words":[["eminence",127,135],["right",143,148],["gained",225,231],["right",314,319],["delightful",364,374],["noble",421,426],["celebrated",511,521],["amply",560,565],["reputation",579,589],["neat",694,698],["modern",760,766],["right",1419,1424],["elegant",1441,1448],["right",1583,1588],["great",1633,1638],["grand",1812,1817]],"neg_words":[["indifferent",24,35],["unequal",186,193],["contend",1357,1364],["barren",1681,1687]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["near",63,67],["left",267,271],["above",461,466],["left",839,843],["left",928,932],["beyond",1250,1256]],"spa_preps":[["through",13,20],["under",118,123],["under",621,626],["round",674,679],["through",874,881],["through",951,958],["above",1041,1046],["round",1155,1160],["under",1529,1534],["into",1614,1618],["over",1737,1741]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0718562874,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986525774},{"para_id":81,"paragraph":"Nothing can be more striking than the river and the noble warehouses on the quay, when viewed from this approach; and as you come nearer to the town, the lofty turretsof the castle overhang it with a royal grandeur, almost rivalling those of Windsor.

The whole ride is charming, on an elevation above the banks of the river, with high hills rising on each side. Soon after we had passed the mile-stone, the great scene of Lonsdale opened, and we pursued the Lune winding in a variety of folds, under a steep cliff entirely covered with wood, and encircled by the richest meadows. A pine-cladhill rose on the right, and descended to a village, whose whitened houses terminated the fore ground. Beyond it the vale became more extensive, and the river was yet tobe traced at a distance, under Hornby church and castle, while the outline grew more wild and mountainous, till the whole scene was closed by the lofty barried on Ingleborough, projecting his rocky head and furrowed sides with unequalled magnificence. All that could please and delight the eye was contained in this beautiful landscape; and enoughof the sublime was added to give it im-portance without inspiring terror. On our return to Lancaster, we could not but be struck with the noble appearance of the castleand church, which impended over the town and river with infinite majesty, while the elegant structure of the new bridge divided the stream below in the happiest position. The following day was less prepitious, but we had sun shine enough between the storms to enjouy the frequent views of the sands ex-tending into the great bay of Morecambe, which every ascent in the first part of our ride presented. The country soon grew more mountainous as we receded from the coast, and the lofty eminence of Warton craggon the left, was finely opposed by the bold and rugged cliff of Farlton Knot on the right. After we left the little town of Burton, we passed immediately under the almost perpendicular height of the latter mountain, from whence a lovely succession of hills and vallies, ornamented with the most picturesque inclosures, and covered with thick woods, conducted us imperceptibly to the top of a hill, which com-manded the large town of Kendale, spread overthe summit of a knowl, gently rising in the midst of the vale from which it takes its name, and almost surrounded by the River Kent. A great variety of wild and unequalhills closed in upon it at a small distance on every side; and far behind, the indented summits of the Westmorland and Cumberland mountains extended in a long irregularchain high above them all. kendale consists principally of one street near a mile long, ascending on each side to the market-place, which breaks in upon the center in-conveniently. The river flows all along beneath, and is crossed by two old bridges, on of which bears the name of Stramon gate; and near it a round hill rises on the right, crowned with the ruins of Kendale castle. Little more than a circular row of unequal fragments remains; but the situation is bold, and must have commanded the town completely. This place is famous for a branch of the woolen manufacture; though I could not find that the green colour which Falstaff so happily descried in the dark, is still predominant. The town is abundantly po-pulous, and it happening to be market day when we were there, the concourse of the country people from the hills wasprodigious, and gave it the appearance of a fair. Most of them drove a small light cart, which came filled with turf or peat, to be disposed of, and returned loaded with the produce of the market. We made an excursion from hence to see the falls of the Kent, and passed by the old hall of Sizergh on the Mil - thorpe turnpike, to Leven's bridge, close to a very ancient seat of Lord Suffolk, which formerly belonged to the Bellingham family. Being provided with a key at Kendale, we passed through the park, a beautiful tract of ground, full of charming inequalities, and decorated with a profusion of the finest trees scattered about in large clumps. Among these, the beech, and a grand avenue of oaks, were most eminent; several large haw-thorns distinguished every swell, and thick groves of birch hung over the steepmargin of the river, which rolled in a mountain torrent, and wound delightfully through the middle of the grounds. As soon as we left this enchanting scene, the road ledus through a romantic glen, almost on the edge of a precipice above the river, till we came to a point, where a bold and rough arch connects the impending rocks on eachside, through which the stream rushes in a dark and gloomy current, and soon falls in a foaming cataract over several high ledges of the rock, after which it is embosomedin the wood of Leven's park. A forge lately erected somewhat lower on the opposite bank, has a little diminished the beauty of this scene, by baying up the water, andmaking the torrent less full than nature had left it; but still there is enough to please the eye, and delight the mind sufficiently.","file_id":"1795_a","plnames":[["Hornby",121,127],["Lune",393,397],["Hornby",725,731],["Ingleborough",857,869],["Lancaster",1132,1141],["Morecambe,",1541,1551],["Warton",1707,1713],["Burton",1843,1849],["River Kent",2293,2303],["Westmorland",2443,2454],["Cumberland",2459,2469],["Kent",3596,3600],["Sizergh",3632,3639],["Leven",3673,3678],["Suffolk",3726,3733],["Leven",4685,4690]],"geonouns":[["stone",108,113],["road",128,132],["banks",240,245],["river",253,258],["hills",270,275],["stone",331,336],["winding",398,405],["wood",471,475],["meadows",506,513],["village",569,576],["houses",593,599],["ground",620,626],["vale",642,646],["river",678,683],["church",732,738],["castle",743,749],["head",892,896],["landscape",1020,1029],["church",1213,1219],["town",1245,1249],["river",1254,1259],["bridge",1322,1328],["stream",1341,1347],["sands",1502,1507],["bay",1534,1537],["country",1616,1623],["coast",1674,1679],["town",1835,1839],["mountain",1925,1933],["hills",1970,1975],["woods",2061,2066],["top",2102,2105],["hill",2111,2115],["town",2144,2148],["summit",2176,2182],["vale",2229,2233],["summits",2428,2435],["mountains",2470,2479],["street",2571,2577],["market",2626,2632],["river",2693,2698],["bridges",2750,2757],["gate",2797,2801],["hill",2823,2827],["castle",2882,2888],["town",3007,3011],["town",3205,3209],["market",3258,3264],["country",3310,3317],["hills",3334,3339],["market",3532,3538],["hall",3624,3628],["turnpike",3660,3668],["bridge",3681,3687],["seat",3713,3717],["park",3845,3849],["ground",3872,3878],["trees",3956,3961],["groves",4128,4134],["river",4177,4182],["mountain",4202,4210],["grounds",4269,4276],["road",4324,4328],["glen",4354,4358],["edge",4374,4378],["precipice",4384,4393],["river",4404,4409],["point",4429,4434],["rocks",4487,4492],["stream",4524,4530],["cataract",4596,4604],["rock",4637,4641],["wood",4677,4681],["park",4693,4697],["bank",4753,4757],["water",4826,4831]],"pos_words":[["favour",52,58],["deservedly",152,162],["charming",204,212],["great",342,347],["variety",411,418],["right",543,548],["magnificence",932,944],["delight",972,979],["beautiful",1010,1019],["sublime",1048,1055],["inspiring",1097,1106],["noble",1179,1184],["majesty",1274,1281],["elegant",1293,1300],["shine",1434,1439],["enough",1440,1446],["great",1528,1533],["eminence",1695,1703],["finely",1736,1742],["right",1803,1808],["lovely",1949,1955],["picturesque",2014,2025],["great",2307,2312],["variety",2313,2320],["conveniently",2675,2687],["right",2841,2846],["famous",3038,3044],["happily",3149,3156],["fair",3387,3391],["beautiful",3853,3862],["charming",3888,3896],["profusion",3932,3941],["finest",3949,3955],["grand",4025,4030],["eminent",4057,4064],["distinguished",4091,4104],["delightfully",4230,4242],["enchanting",4302,4312],["romantic",4345,4353],["beauty",4787,4793],["enough",4909,4915],["delight",4939,4946],["sufficiently",4956,4968]],"neg_words":[["staid",3,8],["steep",437,442],["wild",779,783],["rocky",886,891],["terror",1107,1113],["struck",1163,1169],["wild",2324,2328],["breaks",2646,2652],["ruins",2865,2870],["unequal",2925,2932],["dark",3173,3177],["falls",3583,3588],["inequalities",3897,3909],["hung",4144,4148],["torrent",4211,4218],["wound",4224,4229],["rough",4453,4458],["impending",4477,4486],["dark",4543,4547],["gloomy",4552,4558],["falls",4577,4582],["torrent",4847,4854]],"events":[],"dates":[["two days",9,17],["day",1394,1397],["day",3265,3268],["the middle of the",4251,4268]],"times":[],"distances":[["mile",103,107],["mile",326,330],["a mile",2583,2589]],"loc_advs":[["above",230,235],["without",1089,1096],["left",1726,1730],["left",1819,1823],["behind",2407,2413],["near",2578,2582],["there",3282,3287],["left",4292,4296],["above",4394,4399],["left",4881,4885],["there",4900,4905]],"spa_preps":[["under",429,434],["under",719,724],["over",1236,1240],["below",1348,1353],["between",1447,1454],["into",1519,1523],["under",1873,1878],["above",2519,2524],["along",2709,2714],["beneath",2715,2722],["near",2807,2811],["round",2817,2822],["close",3689,3694],["through",3833,3840],["about",3972,3977],["over",4149,4153],["through",4243,4250],["through",4335,4342],["through",4506,4513],["over",4605,4609],["opposite",4744,4752]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0461538462,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988717437},{"para_id":83,"paragraph":"As we proceeded on the bank of the river, we passed a pretty new-built mansion, which looked down upon one of the finest reaches of the stream, just where it is ruffledby a shallow.

After passing through Dalton, where the abbot of Furness held his court in an old building yet remaining, I visited one ofthe iron mines with which this country abounds; it seemed worked with great spirit and success, and the roads in the country are all tinged with the ore. In the eveningwe visited Connished priory the elegant seat of Mr. Bradyll, who has fitted up his house and laid out his grounds with much taste. It stands on an elevated spot above the coast under a pyramidical hill of wood, and commands an uninterrupted view over Cartmel, the sands, and the whole coast of Lancashire, in which Lancaster church andcastle are distinguished objects at a considerable distance. Conniston mere was our next object; and we continued to traverse a bleak unplea - sant country from Ulverston, till that beautiful lake became visible at the foot of a vast range of rocky mountains. it is about six miles in legth and a mile in breadth, of nearly an oval form, and includes in its circumference all that can be deemed picturesque, in great perfection. After crossing Lowick bridge over the River Crake, which flows from it, we descended through the miserable village of Nibthwayte to its bank, and all traces of cultivation immediately vanished. A rugged forest of underwoodclothed each of its shores, through which an un-equal and dangerous track led us on a shelf immediately above the chrystal level. A lofty range of mountains, towering into one prodigious summit rose directly in front, and descended abruptly into a chain of mishapen rocks, which extended along the head of the water. All the horrors ofan inhabited world seems here collected; but the chrystal surface of the lake smiled sweetly in the midst of them, and seemed to contrast the asperity of the country. Atlength we discovered near its head two beautiful round hills, one of which glowed with the most luxuriant cultivation, while the other was covered with a coat of thethickest wood, gently undulating in several swells till it rose above our sight. Between these hills we descried the vil-lage of Conniston, whose church and cottages were charmingly dispersed about the hollow; a white house of a superior kind adorned the margin of the lake, and the ivied walls of Conniston hall peeped forth amidst a grove of tall trees. Above all, the mountains rose in all their native sublimity; a craggy pile of rocks bounded the view abruptly, and the aspiring summit of the highest rising in a conic form, seemed the crater of some great volcano.","file_id":"1795_a","plnames":[["Furness",34,41],["Dalton",232,238],["Furness",259,266],["Cartmel",751,758],["Lancashire",794,804],["Lancaster",815,824],["Ulverston",996,1005],["Lowick",1279,1285],["River Crake",1302,1313]],"geonouns":[["country",74,81],["sea",124,127],["hills",137,142],["building",292,300],["country",363,370],["roads",436,441],["country",449,456],["seat",540,544],["house",583,588],["grounds",606,613],["coast",671,676],["hill",697,701],["wood",705,709],["sands",764,769],["coast",785,790],["church",825,831],["mere",906,910],["country",983,990],["lake",1027,1031],["foot",1054,1058],["mountains",1084,1093],["bridge",1286,1292],["village",1371,1378],["bank",1400,1404],["forest",1467,1473],["shores",1506,1512],["track",1554,1559],["mountains",1633,1642],["summit",1673,1679],["rocks",1752,1757],["head",1784,1788],["water",1796,1801],["lake",1894,1898],["country",1979,1986],["head",2020,2024],["hills",2045,2050],["wood",2164,2168],["hills",2250,2255],["church",2301,2307],["cottages",2312,2320],["house",2373,2378],["lake",2424,2428],["walls",2444,2449],["hall",2463,2467],["grove",2490,2495],["trees",2504,2509],["mountains",2526,2535],["rocks",2589,2594],["summit",2639,2645]],"pos_words":[["great",16,21],["grandeur",200,208],["abounds",371,378],["worked",390,396],["great",402,407],["success",419,426],["elegant",532,539],["distinguished",846,859],["beautiful",1017,1026],["picturesque",1230,1241],["great",1246,1251],["perfection",1252,1262],["led",1560,1563],["prodigious",1662,1672],["sweetly",1906,1913],["beautiful",2029,2038],["luxuriant",2086,2095],["charmingly",2326,2336],["superior",2384,2392],["great",2711,2716]],"neg_words":[["bleak",57,62],["barren",67,73],["deficient",183,192],["object",924,930],["bleak",963,968],["rocky",1078,1083],["miserable",1361,1370],["dangerous",1544,1553],["abruptly",1718,1726],["hollow",2357,2363],["abruptly",2612,2620]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["about six miles",1101,1116],["a mile",1130,1136]],"loc_advs":[["here",1846,1850],["near",2011,2015]],"spa_preps":[["through",224,231],["out",598,601],["above",661,666],["under",677,682],["over",746,750],["over",1293,1297],["through",1349,1356],["through",1514,1521],["above",1590,1595],["into",1653,1657],["into",1727,1731],["along",1774,1779],["round",2039,2044],["above",2219,2224],["about",2347,2352],["amidst",2481,2487]],"normalised_sentiment":0.036437247,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9739328027},{"para_id":93,"paragraph":"We dwelt long upon this view, which united so happily the beautiful and sublime, and asccending a steep hill on the right, soon lost sight of Conniston lake, andregained the view of win-dermere at a considerable distance.

In front the mighty mountain of Glenamara, with various others, as uncouth and horrible intheir figures as their names, formed a grand amphitheatre, beneath which the small but highly cultivated vale of Rothwayte was visible, and a range of the most smilingwoods and pastures, divided by the meander-ing Derwent, shewed us a second Eden in the midst of the sur-rounding chaos. We passed, through the little village which givesits name to the valley, to the spot where the road divides in front of the chapel at the foot of Glenamara, which is ge-nerally the utmost extent of the traveller's progress.

We followed it no further, but satisfied with the wonders he had seen, repassed them withpleasure in our return. The prospect on our coming forth from this gloomy region was beyond measure striking. In front of the lake, which glowed like burnished gold, Skid Daw displayed his verdant head and sides, finely illuminated by the evening sun marking each furrow distinctly, and all before us was light, cheerful, and habitable, as if we had emerged from the regions of eternal night into day.

The more animated scene of Derwent lay in front, adn behind it, in a broad gap betweenthe mountains, the placid vale of Newlands opened a truly pastoral landscape, full of small inclo-sures and corn-fields, and enlivened with many whitened cot-tages. Thewoods of Foe park, covering an eminence before us, concealed the town of Keswick, through a part of which I passed to a whimsical house, or rather a chain of single rooms, which Lord William Gordon has built on the bank of the lake. The architecture indeed, both of this house and Mr. Pocklington's numerous buildings, is not much to be approved, and in the latter the pert appearance of a tall house, full of small Venetian windows, suit but ill with the grandeur and simplicity of the surrounding country, and seems bettercalculated for the meri-dian of five miles round the metropolis. Both these gentlemen, however, deserv\u00e9 ample praise for the spirit of improvement they have introducedinto the country, and Lord william Gor Don in particular is now employed about a noble road, carried for a considerable extent on a raised terrace above the lake, which views with the magnificence of a Roman work; and when finished, will present a scene almost rivalling the beauties of the opposite shore. I traced it for some distanceas far as it was opposite shore. I traced it for some distance as far as it was passable, and had a more complete view than I could before gain of the whole lake withits islands immediately below me, while the close-impending cliffs of Barrowside made a bold finish to the opposite view, and Skiddaw on the left closed up the am-phitheatre. I could not leave Keswick without making an at-tempt to scale the top of that mighty hill; but though I gained the summit, after a long and laboriousascent of five miles, the clouds collecting all around, prevented my enjoying the ample prospect it affords, and soon enveloped the whole in obscurity. The two lakes, however, were still distinct and beautiful ob-jects, and the chaos of mountains around Borrodale hung their diminished heads far below, while the craggy top of Helvellynalone presumed to equal the height on which I stood. In a clear day, I am told the Isle of Man is visible from hence, and the coast of Scotland with the Galloway mountainsmay be ob-served towards Port Patrick, where the Irish shore advances to meet it; while on the right the Northumbrian hills of Cheviot rise boldly in view. For my part I could only discern the Sol Way Frith, dividing England and Scotland, andsome blue hills on the Scotch side, when the advancing storm drove me from my position, and I was gad to avoid its fury by a precipitate descent.","file_id":"1795_a","plnames":[["Bassenthwayte",66,79],["Skiddaw",124,131],["Derwent",272,279],["Newlands",365,373],["Keswick",572,579],["Barrowside",1762,1772],["Skiddaw",1818,1825],["Keswick",1885,1892],["Borrodale",2270,2279],["Isle",2435,2439],["Scotland",2487,2495],["Galloway",2505,2513],["Port Patrick",2548,2560],["Cheviot",2650,2657],["England",2740,2747],["Scotland",2752,2760]],"geonouns":[["water",80,85],["banks",195,200],["houses",223,229],["head",239,243],["gap",320,323],["mountains",335,344],["vale",357,361],["landscape",398,407],["fields",444,450],["park",512,516],["town",564,568],["house",629,634],["bank",714,718],["lake",726,730],["house",770,775],["buildings",807,816],["house",894,899],["country",998,1005],["country",1199,1206],["road",1277,1281],["terrace",1329,1336],["lake",1347,1351],["shore",1490,1495],["shore",1552,1557],["lake",1683,1687],["islands",1696,1703],["hill",1952,1956],["summit",1982,1988],["lakes",2176,2181],["mountains",2253,2262],["heads",2302,2307],["top",2336,2339],["coast",2478,2483],["shore",2578,2583],["hills",2641,2646],["hills",2775,2780]],"pos_words":[["calm",133,137],["eminence",530,538],["grandeur",955,963],["ample",1127,1132],["praise",1133,1139],["improvement",1158,1169],["noble",1271,1276],["magnificence",1374,1386],["work",1398,1402],["gain",1665,1669],["tempt",1914,1919],["top",1933,1936],["mighty",1945,1951],["gained",1971,1977],["enjoying",2085,2093],["ample",2098,2103],["beautiful",2216,2225],["right",2618,2623]],"neg_words":[["impending",1742,1751],["obscurity",2157,2166],["chaos",2244,2249],["hung",2280,2284],["fury",2880,2884],["precipitate",2890,2901]],"events":[],"dates":[["about a",1263,1270],["a clear day",2408,2419]],"times":[],"distances":[["five miles",1055,1065],["five miles",2026,2036]],"loc_advs":[["near",230,234],["behind",298,304],["left",1833,1837],["without",1893,1900]],"spa_preps":[["over",32,36],["along",106,111],["along",185,190],["through",581,588],["round",1066,1071],["above",1337,1342],["opposite",1481,1489],["opposite",1543,1551],["below",1716,1721],["close",1736,1741],["opposite",1799,1807],["around",2064,2070],["around",2263,2269],["below",2312,2317]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0444444444,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.998770535},{"para_id":107,"paragraph":"At length we left Keswick, highly satisfied with the wonders and beauties that nature has embellished it with, and passing through the fertile vale of Saint John, soon reached an open country, over which we proceeded to Penrith.
