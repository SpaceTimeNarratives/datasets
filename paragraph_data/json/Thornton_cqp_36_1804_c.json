Our judicious Camden, in whose days it was a new thing, would not venture to give it a Latin name, but calls it a metallic earth, or hard, shining, stony substance, which, whether it was the pingites or melanteria of Dioscorides, or an ochre burnt to blackness, and so unknown to the ancients, he left others to enquire. Dr. Merret, from the use to which it was first applied, named it ingrica fabrilis. The learned Boyle is of opinion, that it has not anything metallic in its nature; relying upon which, we have ventured to give it a place here. It is, indeed, a very singular substance; but, being common, and, consequently, well known, it would be needless to describe it. It is found, but in very trivial quantities in several mines here, by itself is on Barrowdale, about six miles from Keswick, in the county of Cumberland. It is there called wadd, and those who are best acquainted with it, style it a black, pinguid, shining earth, which they suppose to be impregnated with lead and antimony. When it was first discovered, the people used it to mark their sheep: it was afterwards introduced into medicine, and taken in powder for the cure of the cholic and gravel; but it has since been applied to many other purposes. It serves to scour, clean, and give a lustre to wrought iron, and defends it from rust: it is applied in the varnishing crucibles, and other earthen vessels that are to be exposed to the fiercest fire, which end it answers effectually: but, after all, the great consumption of it is in two articles; in dying, to fix blues, so that they may never change their colour, and in pencils. The latter articles, being confined to this country, is so well known and as universally allowed, that they are from thence styled abroad, crayons d' Angleterre. It arises from hence, that this substance is little known to foreigners, the most learned of whom speak of it very confusedly, and with much uncertainty. These farther particulars we may venture to affirm concerning it, without any danger of misleading our readers; that the mine before mentioned is private property, is opened but once in seven years, and the quantity known to be equal to the consumption in that space sold at once: and, as it is used without any preparation, it is more valuable than the ore of any metal found in this island. But there is nothing improbable, much less impossible, in supporting that other, and it may be many other uses, will be discovered in medicine, painting, dying, varnishing, or pottery, which would certainly contribute to raise the value of a mineral peculiar to this country, and, with the nature of which, though so long in our possession, we are still so imperfectly acquainted.'","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[["Barrowdale",894,904],["Keswick",927,934],["Cumberland",953,963]],"geonouns":[["common",735,741],["county",943,949],["country",1791,1798],["island",2448,2454],["country",2723,2730]],"pos_words":[["lead",8,12],["judicious",138,147],["well",762,766],["best",1008,1012],["lead",1117,1121],["cure",1278,1282],["clean",1383,1388],["great",1619,1624],["well",1806,1810],["affirm",2107,2113],["valuable",2399,2407],["supporting",2514,2524]],"neg_words":[["hard",267,271],["unknown",403,410],["needless",786,794],["trivial",836,843],["wrought",1411,1418],["rust",1445,1449],["dying",1666,1671],["confined",1774,1782],["danger",2141,2147],["misleading",2151,2161],["improbable",2477,2487],["impossible",2499,2509],["dying",2610,2615],["peculiar",2706,2714],["imperfectly",2813,2824]],"events":[],"dates":[["days",165,169],["seven years",2249,2260]],"times":[],"distances":[["about six miles",906,921]],"loc_advs":[["left",431,435],["here",676,680],["here",872,876],["there",971,976],["abroad",1878,1884],["without",2129,2136],["without",2363,2370],["there",2460,2465]],"spa_preps":[["into",1235,1239]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0131004367,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9893696308},{"para_id":24,"paragraph":"Bidding adieu to Keswick, we proceeded for Rydal Hall, sending a servant forward to inform my worthy friend, Sir Michael Fleming, that I should pass a few hours with him in my way to Ambleside.","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[["Keswick",17,24],["Rydal Hall",43,53],["Ambleside",183,192]],"geonouns":[["pass",144,148]],"pos_words":[["worthy",94,100]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["a few hours",149,160]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["forward",73,80]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0526315789,"vader_sentiment":0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9962213039},{"para_id":25,"paragraph":"The road becomes very hilly, immediately on leaving the town, and, at the one mile stone, we stopped to admire a most beautiful view, comprising the whole valley, and a circuit of twenty miles, bounded by stupendous mountains.

Indeed, if we may judge from the extensive tenter-grounds surrounding the town, it is already in a flourishing condition. The River Kent, over which there are three stone bridges, meanders through the town; and running into a pretty valley, renders the situation very convenient for bleaching their cottons and linens. The white appearance of the cloth on the tenters, it seems, has deceived strangers on their approach to the town in the dusk of the evening, who have mistaken them for small buildings, most of the houses being of stone, covered with a white, rough cast; and this deception made them conceive the town to be much larger than it is in reality.","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[["Kendal",19,25],["River Kent",383,393]],"geonouns":[["grounds",307,314],["town",331,335],["stone",422,427],["bridges",428,435],["town",458,462],["valley",490,496],["town",684,688],["buildings",750,759],["houses",773,779],["stone",789,794],["town",872,876]],"pos_words":[["industrious",35,46],["famous",163,169],["great",231,236],["advantages",237,247],["flourishing",356,367],["pretty",483,489],["convenient",525,535]],"neg_words":[["fabrication",133,144],["mistaken",726,734],["rough",818,823],["deception",839,848]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["dusk",696,700],["the evening",704,715]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",406,411]],"spa_preps":[["over",395,399],["through",446,453],["into",476,480]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0416666667,"vader_sentiment":0.26,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980450869},{"para_id":110,"paragraph":"At the Hee, near Kendal, the property of Mr. Robinson, a few years since a branch was blown off a beech tree, which measured two hundred cubic feet; the parent tree, when cut down, measured eight hundred feet.","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[["Kendal",17,23]],"geonouns":[["tree",104,108],["tree",160,164]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["a few years",55,66]],"times":[],"distances":[["two hundred cubic feet",125,147],["eight hundred feet",190,208]],"loc_advs":[["near",12,16]],"spa_preps":[["down",175,179]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.27,"roberta_sentiment":0.9885752797},{"para_id":111,"paragraph":"With proper acknowledgments for his polite attention and repeated civilities, I bid adieu to my worthy friend, and got on horseback precisely at twelve o'clock, intending, if possible to be at Marshfield by three.","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["proper",5,11],["polite",36,42],["worthy",96,102],["precisely",132,141]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["twelve o'clock",145,159]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.2105263158,"vader_sentiment":0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983543158},{"para_id":112,"paragraph":"The country, on quitting the suburbs of Kendal, becomes very barren, being almost destitute of leaf or grass; the russet predominates, and the road is hilly and stony, which made it unpleasant riding; but soon coming in sight of Kirby Lonsdale, my eye was instantly relieved, and my ideas enlivened; for here the beautiful River Lune refreshes the vale; some hanging woods, corn fields, and good pastures, together with the pleasing appearance of the neat town of Kirby Lonsdale rendered the scene quite delightful.","file_id":"1804_c","plnames":[["Kendal",40,46],["Kirby Lonsdale",229,243],["River Lune",323,333],["Kirby Lonsdale",464,478]],"geonouns":[["country",4,11],["road",143,147],["vale",348,352],["woods",367,372],["fields",379,385],["town",456,460]],"pos_words":[["instantly",256,265],["beautiful",313,322],["good",391,395],["pleasing",424,432],["neat",451,455],["delightful",504,514]],"neg_words":[["barren",61,67],["destitute",82,91],["unpleasant",182,192]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",304,308],["together",406,414]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.06,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988567829}]
