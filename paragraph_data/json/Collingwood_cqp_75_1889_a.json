With eagle eye he sees that the haven was fair, being a landlocked pool where three rivers meet, and a narrow opening to the hyperboreal expanse of storm. Note by the way that hereabouts they find pearls, though such as I have seen to-night be but little and internally brownish of hue, with no more than a dull gleam upon them. But with a word our Julius bids a camp arise; and lo! a town, well placed, defensible, and for such a climate neither unfit nor uninhabitable. Yonder, they say,-- I saw it not,-- one beholds the isle of Mona: and from this port go three roads,-- to the south, to the north, and to the west,-- whereby the goods of merchant and the sinews of war are carried on the backs of men and horses far into the heart of the land. Here then are the consummation of my travel through woods and wilds I am greeted by the delights of life: supper not wholly uneatable, being a sheldrake, thought a delicacy by these natives, and with it a salmon and oysters. There is a roof above me fairly built: a couch to lie upon, and-- wonder of wonders!-- a bath within a few paces of the door. What is no less welcome, I find converse of human beings unlike the apes of the mountains. Think not I mean the same breed with those of Africa, but creatures that are not far removed. Thou sayest, even apes are not too mean nor too unclean for thy disciple to regard with the eye of inquiry: be it so; and indeed I have sought to take the measure of these Gadelic monsters, even to the gauging of their poor wits, and the probing of their shallow ideas of things they ignorantly assert concerning the gods. But the mere sound of a Greek or even a Roman voice cheers me, after the painful solecisms of barbarous guides, and the interpreted stammerings of the more uncouth mountaineers. \" Ah me!\" have I often said, as I strove to hear their various and incomprehensible babbling,\" who shall interpret the interpreters!\" I call them apes, but in jest. Thou knowest I scorn them not wholly in my heart; for as the Roman says,\" Homo sum,\" and so forth. Now wilt thou ask, where have I been? in what wilds? among what savages? finding what adventures? My Ammonius, among the Gadeli, for so my apes are called; and in their savagest hills. Mountains I know, and thou knowest: for do not the mountains rise behind Tarsus, my native town, city of great men? and do they not encircle thy sacred home of Delphi? But what is the great Parnassus' self to these they call Skudau, and Elbelin, and the Pens and Kathars and such-like names innumerable in their jargon? Thinkest thou I compare them for their size? not so: for in mere altitude I reckon Taurus or the Heliconian summit at twice their importance. Thinkest thou for their prospects? I smile. Never was sight more horrible. For sheer lack of aught that may make travelling endurable; for cold and wet, for hunger and toil, for roughness of rock and pathless-ness of waste, for treacherous swamp and tangled forest, and above all for danger of yet unsubdued savages, fiercer than their wolves and wild bulls,-- for these no Caucasus nor Alps may be compared with that I have gone through to-day; and I shake the dust,-- nay, the mud of them, from my weary feet. For being sent, as thou knowest, O Ammonius, by Augustus Domitian, whom the gods preserve, to search out the resources of this island, and to add unknown wealth to the glory of the empire, I came to Eburacum. How I travelled; what honourable reception I had from the governor; how I laboured to approve myself worthy of his welcome, teaching for a season in the schools which he,-- greatly( in my judgment) hoping-- has founded for the better sort of barbarians;-- all this have I written and sent by the imperial messenger. To the daring seaman who pushes forth into the unknown to-morrow I entrust these less valued lines. Know then that Agricola the governor, having travelled in these parts, and having sought information from the natives, bade me search diligently for certain iron and copper of which tales were told. I heard and obeyed. By the road his centurions had made I travelled through the land of the Brigantes, making all haste across the less rugged but not more fertile hill-country, until I came to a great bay, called by the Britons Mor Kam, which is to say' the crooked sea.' Thence over wide wet sands. Thou knowest, in these places the sea falls twice a day, and twice comes roaring back to take up its place. Was it that which Homer meant in saying' the Streams of Ocean,' and not only the currents and whirlpools thereof? I leave this by the way to thy better judgment. Now across the sands there is a well-known road, by the coasts of the Sistuntii: and where the successive estuaries of Lona and Kanta and Lebena give place to dry land, the road is made over white rocks that put me in mind of the white crags of Greece. Forgive the comparison! for to an exile even the likeness of stone with stone takes the eye. And these white rocks, whereof I bring with me morsels, are assuredly like our marble, though coarser in grain, being well fitted for burning to lime. There is also good abundance of a tophaceous marl, fit for agriculture. Now when I had passed the sands without mishap, trusting to my guides, I came to a road well made in the red earth, through an undulating land; and on a brow above a little valley found lodging in the station founded by our Agricola. Thereabouts the rocks are red; and it needed no witness to show me iron lying somewhere hidden in the limestone. Not to weary thee with many a day's toil, I found good ore, and marked the spots. Showing my tablets of authority to the prefect, I bade him set men to work digging it in places better and more profitable than those where the ignorant natives had scratched the soil with rude stone tools, smelting the red ore in ruder hearths. Thence, after repose, seven days ago-- it seems a month of nights-- I set forth, hearing that copper was found in the mountains. My heart failed me to venture into those trackless wilds; but duty, and the service I owe, impelled me to risk my life: for am I not as it were the soldier of philosophy? Therefore I set forth with a good company, and well armed, given me by the prefect, under a centurion responsible for my safe conduct, to whom was added a ragged crew of aborigines who partly for fear and slavish awe, and partly tempted by promises-- for Agricola's comity has taught me to deal friendly even with these apes-- had taken oath on all they held sacred,-- of which more hereafter,-- to show me where copper might be. For thou mayest believe to seek mines in these mountains, be a man ever so expert, is seeking knots in a rush, without he have some forewarning of their place. In a little while we left the plain, if plain it be called, being but the shelf of shore along another estuary. Forgive the comparison again!-- but I held it not unlike the coasts of thy home, in that mountains stand over against mountains, with inlets of the sea between. Then we struck into the wilderness, and forced our way through woods of oak and beech; the olive is unknown in this region, nor does the cypress grow, though the juniper is as it were a mockery of it; and we passed over tracts of heather, which( wonderful to relate) blooms even here. It gladdened me to breathe its well-remembered fragrance. Much club-moss is found on the hills, and plucked by our Britons for charms, according to their religion. Before us were ever the distant mountains, purple on the afternoon sky. The multitude of birds astonished me. Of lesser kinds were flights innumerable: but what thou wouldst admire is the wild peacock of the north, a great bird of many colours that makes its nest in these moors. At evening, so wearied was I, for I could not always ride on my horse, the ways being far too rough, and I often rode on the back of an unsavoury Gadelus-- pity me, Ammonius!-- so wearied was I that I fell supine upon the heather which they gathered for my couch, and so continued until the sun was high. That day I came to a lake, long and narrow, embosomed in the wooded hills. Here the fresh-water fishery might be to some profit, if ever men were brought to live so far away from the world: but who can dwell in such a place, even to eat fresh trout? Upon heathery wastes I did indeed see huts of the Gadeli, and smoke arising. I bade my men catch one of these same apes, that I might see whether he had the form of humanity: and one they caught asleep in his lair. He blinked at me from under a shaggy red thatch of matted hair; and truly, though thou mayest exclaim and doubt, he might have passed, were he washed and combed, for one of those red Galatians, long limbed and barbarous of aspect, whom I have seen come down to Tarsus. But he would answer no word to all questions, and my men, being used to such cattle, began to twist his arms and chastise him, that he should speak. But I, more humane, as becomes thy disciple and a follower of our Julius, bade them somewhat sharply to desist. On which released he was gone in the twinkling of an eye: skipping among the tall bushes of heather, and hardly discernible at the distance of a stone's throw. One of my men, recovering himself, did indeed sling a bullet after him, but it seemed to fail of the mark: for which the centurion smote him down, and promised discipline to those that had let the ape go free. Thou mightest say, my master, that they were not wholly to blame. I will bear it in mind, if indeed punishment be not already meted out. And yet in these wilds there is little time for ethical disputations and the nice balancing of motives, as we use in the schools. The soul of a man deserts his head; which, being prompt, has a justice of its own in this land of Britain. So thus I came into the very heart of the mountains, beside a roaring stream that led into a dell exceeding narrow. I passed therein with fear and trembling; for the rocks were high above my head, and great stones lay around, but lately fallen and shattered. By the mercy of the gods we came through, but only to find rocks still more frightful and dangerous, reaching to the sky all around, and great waterfalls hanging from them, and clouds covering their tops,-- who knows how lofty and threatening? I put up a prayer to the deities of the place and to the genius of Augustus, as well I might; and took heart somewhat: for true it is, in spite of doubting, that holy beings dwell in these sacred recesses. Have I not felt their awe? Even my soldiers,-- nay, even the apes themselves, believe it,-- held breath, and seemed to fear. Now the rock of these mountains is black: and in places I found( for we spent the night even there) certain pillars of stone hexagonal, such as are seen only in land near a burning mountain, for such is my experience. Seeing which, I enquired if fire had ever been known to burst from the earth. They assured me that no such thing was in any old stories or songs of the people. And yet there are great craters in these hills, like that of Vesuvius; sometimes filled with water, which might seem to have quenched the native fire. And yet, thou knowest how Vesuvius, so long quiet, burst forth but five years ago, and with what terrible consequences. I braved every danger, and confident in my mission and the protection of the gods, explored the uttermost cranny of this tartarean gulf. It is in these crannies that copper is found. A white streak of hard stone, sparkling like alabaster, and a glimmer as of gold in it,-- or a streak of soft red earth in the solid rock, stained with green spots,-- betrays the metal. Some little holes had been dug here and there by the natives, but as before the best places were untouched. These I noted, and the manner of finding them again; and shortly( fortune favouring) shall send men to open out mines, and with due authority to work them for copper. But the lamp burns low. My sailor snores at the door, waiting this hour for the letter I scribble hastily. The tablets will hold no more than must suffice to tell thee how, after a day's journey through hills even as frightful, I came to a fort on a steep, lofty tongue of land in the midst of the mountains, where the builders are still at work. There I was well received, and resting for one night, travelled more easily by a road even now in making, through a valley unspeakably hideous and wild, beside a river, whereof when I asked the name they could tell nothing but Usg or Esk, which is no more than to say' water'. Such is the state of these barbarians. And now after short repose I must again venture forth into these mountains, for I hear talk of still richer mines in them. May Oceanus and Tethys, whom I here behold face to face under the stars, send me safe into civilized regions! May all good gods be with thee!

None said nay, for many passed by that road, what with thingmen going to Little Langdale, what with cowper-lads and chapmen: there would be never a two - month's time but new faces came by, and all were welcome. So when they had bite and sup, says the head man of them,' Well I know thee, master Thurstan, by name, and better would I know thee by nature.' With that says he, sitting easily in his high-seat,' Little there is to know but what there is to see. I am an old man, in the old spot.' ' Well,' says the other,' there is one I serve would be thy friend.' ' Good friends,' says he,' are always good finding.' ' True,' says he,' and this is a good friend and a bad foe.' ' I like him the better,\" says Thurstan at the Thwaite. ' They call him William of Lancaster,' the other went on. ' I like him the worse,' says Thurstan in his beard. ' Splendor Dex,' says the stranger,' but thou must like him or lump him.' ' And who art thou, thrall of him they call baron, to come knapping French at me?' Now this was Bernard the forester, and with him was his brother William, and they had a half - score of men with them. And they leaped up and rattled the arrows in their quivers. ' Peace, lads,' cried Thurstan,' I bide no durdoms in my hall. Sit ye down, and sup mannerly. Are ye slockened? Then come with me and I will show ye somewhat.' With that he took his great hollin staff, and went forth of the door, going stiffly because of his age and of the sickness that was in his knee-joints: and led them up to his how aback of the hall, and bade them stand in the garth that was atop of the how, when you come out of the wood on the how-side. ' Look ye well,\" said he, waving the hollin wand around, so that they backed somewhat;' Look ye well and see yon garths and fields, folds and cots, and the reek rising from the hall of the Thwaite. All this land,' said he thrusting the wand into the ground,\" all this land my fore-elders took when it was no-man's land. All this land they cleared, and digged, and ploughed, and tilled. All yon cots they built for their thralls: and yon hall for themselves and their children. Two hundred winters they have lived on this spot, and I hold it now. Go back to your lord that calls himself a Northman, and tell him this. If Northman he be, a Northman's hand he shall have. If Frenchman he be, my old knees are none so lish as they were.' And so the men went back to Kent Dale very ill pleased; but as for the baron, men say he laughed at that word, and was loath to take it ill.","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[["Little Langdale",139,154],["Lancaster",826,835],["Kent",2472,2476]],"geonouns":[["road",105,109],["head",318,322],["seat",468,472],["hall",1303,1307],["door",1470,1474],["hall",1598,1602],["wood",1688,1692],["fields",1834,1840],["hall",1887,1891],["land",1917,1921],["ground",1960,1966],["land",1978,1982],["land",2024,2028],["land",2039,2043],["hall",2147,2151]],"pos_words":[["welcome",269,276],["master",355,361],["better",385,391],["good",667,671],["good",715,719],["like",747,751],["better",760,766],["like",861,865],["like",961,965],["great",1428,1433],["led",1562,1565],["well",1720,1724],["well",1806,1810],["cleared",2049,2056],["pleased",2491,2498]],"neg_words":[["bad",733,736],["foe",737,740],["worse",874,879],["stranger",936,944],["rattled",1209,1216],["sickness",1520,1528],["loath",2563,2568]],"events":[],"dates":[["a day",11,16],["two - month's",214,227],["winters",2199,2206]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",191,196],["there",482,487],["there",508,513],["there",586,591]],"spa_preps":[["down",1316,1320],["out",1677,1680],["around",1759,1765],["into",1951,1955]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0333333333,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9962173104},{"para_id":184,"paragraph":"Chapter Iii.

They were clothed all in woollen, and wore white kirtles that were long to the feet, and hoods and white scarves they called scapulary, and over all, for the weather was cold by now, black gowns to wrap them in. Also they had boots, but gloves they wore none. And the thralls gaped at them, but Thurstan gave them a seat, and they broke bread, but flesh-meat they would not so much as look at. Nevertheless they might drink ale, and they drank it, but not much. So when they were fed, they began to open out their business and it seemed that the one was brother William of Leeds, he who afterwards was cellerar in the Abbey of St. May's, and the other was brother William of Lonsdale. ' Why,' says master Thurstan,' it rains Williams nowadays. But no harm,' says he,' since we like a sup of wet.' ' And get it,' says the monk. ' And thrive on it,' says Thurstan. ' For' says the monk,' He sendeth it on the evil and the good.' ' So I have heard tell,' says Thurstan. ' Maybe ye think us heathens, but many's the time that word has been flung at my head by father John there, when we have had our little strifes:-- easily settled, father John, easily settled, man, are they not?' ' It is well!' said the monk:' for we of Holy Church love a man of worth that bows his neck to the yoke that is easy and light; and in that hope we come.' ' What now?' says Thurstan to the ale-horn, as it were. ' Our lord abbot and our house of St. Mary in Furness, by the grant of King Stephen of blessed memory'--' Whom God forgive,' says the old one. ' It is well,' says the monk,' for all men need it, and the prayer becomes all that can say it; but as I am bidden tell thee, our lord, knowing thee to be a true son of the Church,-- though as yet lacking-- we all lack, my good sir,-- somewhat of perfection, our lord would have thee know that by such kingly grant this land is in his holding'--' It was never a king's to give,' broke forth master Thurstan. ' Hear me, my good master, and hear a friend friendliwise. Our lord abbot is loath to use violence, as violent men of the world use. There be those yonder,' he went on, waving his hand to the morning-ward,' would think no more of roof-burning and throat-cutting than of smoking a wolf out of his earth. Now of all such our men be free, for who dare touch the lands of Holy Church? Many, aye and thy own kin, they of Kirkeby, have come in to us: and what ask we of them? Burdens? Gifts? Shames? Nay, it is honour we show them, gifts we give them, their burdens, as the apostle bids, we bear. Ask master Dolfin thy brother, ask Orm, or any of the holders of the southlands: and be guided.' But for all answer looked master Thurstan across the hall and through the reek of the hearth, as one in a dream; and then slapping his right hand upon the arm of his seat, said he,' See ye this old settle? Heart of oak it is, and black with eld. See ye yon rafters and balks? soot-blue they be, and even yet sound as a bell. See ye the smoke going up? For two hundreds of winters never has the spark died out on the hearth. Holy church we reverence; lords we love not: thralls we are not. And sooner than follow yon nithings to their shame, I would see the roof of my fathers in a low, and lie like a blue coal among the ashes.' So the monks went home and told the abbot, and he took it badly enough.","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[["Leeds",627,632],["Abbey",672,677],["Furness",1490,1497]],"geonouns":[["gate",48,52],["feet",133,137],["seat",370,374],["head",1102,1106],["house",1469,1474],["land",1907,1911],["lands",2354,2359],["hall",2736,2740],["seat",2849,2853],["church",3112,3118]],"pos_words":[["master",752,758],["like",831,835],["thrive",887,893],["good",974,978],["well",1241,1245],["love",1286,1290],["worth",1300,1305],["easy",1345,1349],["well",1595,1599],["good",1810,1814],["perfection",1834,1844],["master",1978,1984],["good",2009,2013],["master",2014,2020],["free",2325,2329],["master",2590,2596],["master",2709,2715],["right",2818,2823],["reverence",3122,3131],["love",3142,3146],["like",3277,3281],["enough",3376,3382]],"neg_words":[["cold",224,228],["broke",385,390],["harm",805,809],["evil",961,965],["lack",1801,1805],["broke",1966,1971],["loath",2072,2077],["violent",2098,2105],["burning",2230,2237],["smoke",3019,3024],["died",3083,3087],["shame",3217,3222],["lie",3273,3276],["badly",3370,3375]],"events":[],"dates":[["another day",11,22],["May",685,688],["two hundreds of winters",3039,3062]],"times":[["the morning",2183,2194]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1122,1127],["across",2725,2731],["home",3330,3334]],"spa_preps":[["over",194,198],["out",558,561],["out",2280,2283],["through",2745,2752],["out",3088,3091],["among",3294,3299]],"normalised_sentiment":0.024024024,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9965806603},{"para_id":186,"paragraph":"Chapter Iv.

For matters of the countryside were still talked over at the old spot in Little Langdale, and folk met there year by year for their sports and their speaking, however it were of little avail. And this time it was said there would be talk of this new business, namely the business of the abbot and the baron and their striving for the fell country. So thither rides Thurstan at the Thwaite with his men; and there he finds his kinsmen Dolfin and Ulf of Kirkeby, and Orm of Ourgrave, and Ailward of Broughton, and Gillemichael of Merton and Orm Bernulfson of Urswick, and Siward and Ketel and others of the old stock, such as had gone under the abbot, because they lived near at hand to him, and feared the Church, and saw what was coming. But with these old Thurstan would have nought to do, and when they spoke friendly he passed them by. And when the business was opened, they spoke for the Abbot and praised his rule, and their lot, and threatened all gainsayers with the ban of the Church, and house-burning and man-slaying. Then spoke up the men out of Westmorland, from Ambleside way and Bronulf's head and Kent Dale and the Lyth, and they were for the baron, bidding the fell-folk think on his might and wealth; for, said they, he could crush the whole tale of them as a lad cracks a nut in his teeth. And then the old man held up his hand to speak. He was tottering with eld and with wrath: and the words clove to his tongue; and he stood there white and angry, being a laughing-stock to all. But before speech could come of him, there was thrusting among the crowd, and into it pressed a little man, in a long gown, swordless and beardless: but behind him was a company of billmen and bowmen, no folk of the fells, and around and about the Thingstead rode a many men on great horses, mailed and helmed, with long spears, and painted shields, and one of them bare a banner, and it was the banner of King Henry. And the little man, going boldly up, stood on the mount, and cried out shrilly as one who speaks a strange tongue, and mockingly as one who has his foe at his foot: and he said' By your leave, good men and liege men all; by the leave of this good company whatsoever it calls itself: the king speaks: hear the word of the king.' And so he fell to reading off a scroll in Latin, and setting it out in English bit by bit, as a lad does with his grammar-task:--' Henricus, Henry, Dei gratia, by the grace of God, rex Angliae, King of England, and so forth and so forth. Sciatis omnes, know ye all, ad quos, to whom, praesentes litterae, these present letters, pervenerint, may come, and so forth. Inspeximus cartam, we have seen the charter-- friends, by your leave I pretermit the Latin, which is here for your learned inspection, and come to the business in plain terms. The king sayeth, he confirms the grant of Stephen Earl of Boulogne and Mortaigne and late king of England, to the abbot and monks of St. Mary in Furness, giving them all his forest of Furness and Wagheney, and so forth and so forth. Likewise our lord the king hath seen and does hereby confirm the grant from the honour of Westmorland to William of Lancaster of the barony of Kent Dale, and so forth.

Thurstan sat there on a rigg of stone that comes up out of the turf, and the stone is blue stone, but is waved in the bait like sand of the sea strand: and that stone is there to this day. Thurstan had let do on him his sword, that was his father's and his father's father's sword before him: and he loosened the strings from the sheath and laid it athwart his knees. And no man spoke to him. In Yewdale all was still. But about noontide when the sun was bright there was a flickering in the trees of Yewdale, where Yewdale beck comes out from betwixt Raven crag and Yewdale crag: and in a while a company of people was seen, some a-foot, some a-horse, coming down the beck bottom as it were down a road. Now these were the company of the thirty men, who had taken oath to divide the land of the fells according to the bidding of Henry: and their dividing was on this wise. First they compassed the country round about, beginning even from Little Langdale, and going by the Broadwater, that is Brathay, to the head of Winandermere, and thence by Leven to Greenodd. And then they made the boundary from the Thingstead to Wreneshause and so down the Duddon to Broughton and the sands. And lastly they halved the land so marked out; for they came beating the bounds from the Brathay to Tillesburgthwaite, and from Tillesburgthwaite down Yewdale beck and so to the head of Thurstan's water, and down the farther shore of Thurstan's water to Crake. But by now they were come into Yewdale: and the array of their company was seen flashing and moving in the noonday sunlight in the dale betwixt the crags and the woods wherein the Tarns are. Which when the old man saw, he stood up, and held his sword in his right hand, and passing out of the garth-door he went slowly down the hill that was his howe, and stood in the beck that was his beck, wading knee-deep in the brown water, and standing there so still that the trout nestled and nosed against his knees. When suddenly by a bend of the river the foremost of the thirty sworn men came in sight, and it was Dolfin of Kirkeby, who knowing that land right well was the guide and leader in their wayfaring. And he was the brother of Thurstan's wife. Whom when Thurstan saw he bade him stand and asked him by what right he thus entered his land with men not unarmed. ' Brother,' said he,--' No brother,' cried the old man,' I know thee not, if thou be not that nithing of the Northmen, that thrall of the monks, that betrayer of thy kin--'' Peace, old man,' cried they all,' and let the king's warrant pass.' ' Fiend take ye all,' shrieked the old man, and his eyes were flashing and his face trembling. ' Foul fall your king, and you, ye dastards, nithings all'; and he spat upon them, and heaved up his brand to fall upon the foremost, crying out with a great cry. But even in that cry he fell, and lay there flat in the water: and when men stooped to lift him up there was no life in him.","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[["Yewdale",541,548],["Yewdale",646,653],["Yewdale",661,668],["Yewdale",712,719],["Little Langdale",1085,1100],["Brathay",1139,1146],["Winandermere",1163,1175],["Leven",1191,1196],["Duddon",1293,1299],["Broughton",1303,1312],["Brathay",1417,1424],["Yewdale",1479,1486],["Crake",1582,1587],["Yewdale",1620,1627]],"geonouns":[["hall",60,64],["woods",122,127],["stone",177,182],["stone",222,227],["stone",236,241],["sea",285,288],["stone",306,311],["trees",637,642],["beck",669,673],["crag",703,707],["crag",720,724],["foot",778,782],["beck",814,818],["road",844,848],["land",929,933],["country",1044,1051],["head",1155,1159],["sands",1321,1326],["land",1355,1359],["beck",1487,1491],["head",1506,1510],["water",1525,1530],["shore",1553,1558],["water",1573,1578],["dale",1720,1724],["crags",1737,1742],["woods",1751,1756],["door",1888,1892],["hill",1917,1921],["beck",1958,1962],["beck",1976,1980],["water",2012,2017],["river",2130,2135],["land",2235,2239],["land",2428,2432],["pass",2690,2694],["water",3011,3016]],"pos_words":[["like",268,272],["bright",600,606],["wise",1013,1017],["right",1847,1852],["foremost",2140,2148],["right",2240,2245],["well",2246,2250],["right",2402,2407],["foremost",2916,2924],["great",2944,2949]],"neg_words":[["bait",263,267],["flickering",619,629],["slowly",1901,1907],["betrayer",2605,2613],["fall",2799,2803],["fall",2902,2906],["cry",2950,2953],["cry",2972,2975],["fell",2979,2983]],"events":[],"dates":[["this day",324,332]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",158,163],["there",315,320],["there",607,612],["there",2032,2037],["there",2993,2998],["there",3054,3059]],"spa_preps":[["out",111,114],["out",197,200],["about",568,573],["out",680,683],["down",805,809],["down",837,841],["round",1052,1057],["about",1058,1063],["down",1284,1288],["out",1370,1373],["down",1474,1478],["down",1536,1540],["into",1615,1619],["out",1871,1874],["down",1908,1912],["against",2080,2087],["out",2933,2936]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0037593985,"vader_sentiment":-0.54,"roberta_sentiment":0.9939348102},{"para_id":192,"paragraph":"Chapter Vii.

The which by labour being restored into some fitness of use, he inhabited, requiring little and content with that which others scorned.","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["water",354,359],["water",424,429],["lake",504,508],["mountains",547,556],["shores",592,598],["hills",617,622],["trees",650,655],["wood",736,740],["coast",946,951],["houses",964,970],["water",1044,1049],["hall",1087,1091],["forest",1200,1206],["land",1207,1211],["mountains",1275,1284],["land",1353,1357],["water",1392,1397],["boat",1415,1419],["shore",1452,1457],["wood",1525,1529],["region",1543,1549],["wood",1715,1719]],"pos_words":[["humility",34,42],["abundant",61,69],["glory",272,277],["well",524,528],["good",1097,1101],["providence",1638,1648],["restored",1823,1831]],"neg_words":[["faults",217,223],["steep",611,616],["beset",631,636],["burning",806,813],["adverse",938,945],["lie",952,955],["desert",1189,1195],["ruinous",1746,1753]],"events":[["Lordship",168,176]],"dates":[["his days",139,147]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["nigh",529,533],["there",716,721],["elsewhere",916,925],["there",1463,1468],["left",1697,1701]],"spa_preps":[["within",360,366],["along",573,578],["beyond",1033,1039],["down",1473,1477],["beyond",1531,1537],["into",1832,1836]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0055248619,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9913221598},{"para_id":245,"paragraph":"This fixes the date; for there were two Sir Johns, father and son, of whom the second died in 1353.","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["died",86,90]],"events":[],"dates":[["1353",94,98]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",25,30]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.1,"vader_sentiment":-0.56,"roberta_sentiment":0.9914916158},{"para_id":246,"paragraph":"[ More verses, so barbarous as to be untranslatable].","file_id":"1889_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["barbarous",18,27]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.3333333333,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.99804461},{"para_id":247,"paragraph":"Many are the wonderful histories yet in the mouths of all, concerning the deeds of this blessed man; how he dwelt there alone, improving the solitude with heavenly converse and wrestling with the demons which infest the darkness of the waste.
