[{"para_id":0,"paragraph":"About 300 yards beyond Springfield, flows the Sark the boundary stream of Scotland on the western side; and as soon as the traveller has left the little bridge over behind him, he finds himself once more in England. The country now gradually assumes a more picturesque aspect. The Solway Firth appears at a distance, like a stripe of a silver, whilst on the other side the Cumberland hills spread themselves out to our view. The road runs here through a very considerable wood of firs and pines, which agreeably reminds us of Germany and its forests. Before reaching Longtown there is a good stone bridge of three arches over the Esk, on which river the town is situated. The inn at Longtown has a very showy outside, but little interior accommodation. From a considerable distance we could perceive the flag waving from the castle at the north end of Carlisle, announcing the birth-day of the Prince Regent( the 12th August). The interior of the castle by no means corresponds with its external appearance, and its uninclosed state effectually contributes to this unfavourable contrast. The streets are of a tolerable breadth for a provincial town, and, as every where else, are kept very clean. Our first visit was to the cathedral, a splendid building, which, however, is greatly inferior in external splendour to those in the south and east of England. It may be considered as composed of two parts, the ancient and the more recent. The first, or eastern part, evidently goes back to the Saxon times; whilst the latter, which was destroyed in the civil war, and has since been rebuilt, bears the marks of recent origin. We found it open, and the canons engaged in the forenoon service, singing an anthem for four voices, in which they were assisted by the choristers, ande accompanied by the organ, which however was unfortunately so dreadfully out of tune, that we congratulated ourselves on not having entered the church until the service was nearly ended. The large window opposite to the entrance is only half filled with old painted glass, the lower part being of plain glass, with a painted border round it. The partition wall between the side-aisles and the nave of the church is painted with the figures of saint anthony, saint Augustin, and other Saints, in water colours, with several inscriptions in the old English language under Them, which were unable to decypher. There are several monuments between the pillars and in other places.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Sark",46,50],["Scotland",74,82],["England",207,214],["Solway Firth",281,293],["Cumberland",373,383],["Longtown",567,575],["Longtown",683,691],["Carlisle",852,860],["England",1348,1355]],"geonouns":[["stream",64,70],["bridge",153,159],["country",220,227],["hills",384,389],["road",429,433],["wood",472,476],["forests",542,549],["stone",592,597],["bridge",598,604],["river",644,649],["town",654,658],["inn",676,679],["castle",825,831],["castle",947,953],["streets",1092,1099],["town",1144,1148],["building",1246,1254],["church",1920,1926],["entrance",1996,2004],["wall",2132,2136],["church",2181,2187],["water",2271,2276],["monuments",2401,2410]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",257,268],["like",317,321],["agreeably",502,511],["good",587,591],["tolerable",1109,1118],["clean",1190,1195],["splendid",1237,1245],["saint",2219,2224],["saint",2234,2239]],"neg_words":[["inferior",1283,1291],["unfortunately",1821,1834],["dreadfully",1838,1848],["unable",2363,2369]],"events":[],"dates":[["birth-day",877,886],["the 12th August",909,924]],"times":[["The first",1437,1446]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",16,22],["left",137,141],["behind",165,171],["here",439,443],["there",576,581],["opposite",1980,1988],["between",2411,2418]],"spa_preps":[["over",160,164],["out",408,411],["through",444,451],["over",621,625],["outside",709,716],["out",1849,1852],["round",2108,2113],["between",2137,2144],["under",2340,2345]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0240384615,"vader_sentiment":-0.79,"roberta_sentiment":0.9972532392},{"para_id":1,"paragraph":"The saxon part of the church has still to beast of the grandeur of its immense pillars and round arches. Qwe found the castle guarded by a detachment of dragoons. Our attention was caught on our entrance by a massy square tower to the right of the gate, and a strong iron portcullis which was lowered seemed threatening to close against us. The inner court forms a spacious square, in which stands the commandant's house, two stories high, a modern built house in the form of a temple. We soon perceive that the castle is half in ruins, and even that part, which is still entire, and which is not shown, is used merely for keeping military stores. One single six - pounder lying on the ground, appeared to represent the whole of the castle artillary. The court-house of the country, built according to a peculiar plan, and certainly unique in its kind, is situated in the southern part of the city: it consists of two square buildings of the same form on both sides of the street, having very large round battlemented towers, containing the courts of justice. The form of the building is this: A the finished, B the unfinished building; C the street; D the projected arch; E E the towers. Both buildings are, when completed, to be connected by an arch over the street. The one to the left is completed, but the outside only of that on the right is yet finished. The whole is, as we might naturally expect, in the Gothic style. The walls of the town, especially on the western side, are still in tolerable good condition, especially on the western side, so as to afford a pleasant walk along the rampants. They were formerly double, and the remains of them and of an old tower are still visible; it is now modenized and appropriated as a building belonging to the deanery. The bridges over the Eden, which runs through a part of the city, are very ancient, very steep, and narrow; and are quite eclipsed by the handsome new stone bridge of six arches, which is crossed on the road to Longtown; and has lately been opened for passangers, although not yet entirely finished. The deanery above-mentioned is a handsome Gothic building, with a large court closed in all sides, covered with gravel, and a garden immediately before the house. The back part of the cathedral, which forms one side of this court, has a far more pituresque appearance than that part fronting the street, and is distinguished by a great profusion of ornamented buttresses. We would recommend our inn to travellers, as from its windows we have an admirable view over a garden opposite to The house, of the country round Carlisle for several miles.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Eden",1793,1797],["Longtown",1983,1991],["Carlisle",2590,2598]],"geonouns":[["church",22,28],["castle",119,125],["entrance",195,203],["tower",222,227],["gate",248,252],["house",415,420],["house",455,460],["castle",512,518],["ground",686,692],["castle",733,739],["house",761,766],["country",774,781],["buildings",925,934],["street",973,979],["towers",1018,1024],["building",1076,1084],["building",1127,1135],["street",1143,1149],["towers",1181,1187],["buildings",1194,1203],["street",1261,1267],["walls",1431,1436],["town",1444,1448],["tower",1670,1675],["building",1737,1745],["bridges",1776,1783],["stone",1923,1928],["bridge",1929,1935],["road",1975,1979],["building",2121,2129],["house",2228,2233],["street",2368,2374],["inn",2467,2470],["house",2562,2567],["country",2576,2583]],"pos_words":[["grandeur",55,63],["immense",71,78],["right",235,240],["strong",260,266],["spacious",365,373],["modern",442,448],["right",1339,1344],["tolerable",1495,1504],["good",1505,1509],["afford",1562,1568],["pleasant",1571,1579],["handsome",1910,1918],["handsome",2105,2113],["distinguished",2383,2396],["great",2402,2407],["profusion",2408,2417],["recommend",2453,2462],["admirable",2517,2526]],"neg_words":[["threatening",308,319],["ruins",530,535],["lying",673,678],["peculiar",804,812],["unfinished",1116,1126],["steep",1861,1866]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["several miles",2603,2616]],"loc_advs":[["left",1284,1288]],"spa_preps":[["round",91,96],["close",323,328],["against",329,336],["round",999,1004],["over",1252,1256],["outside",1311,1318],["along",1585,1590],["over",1784,1788],["through",1810,1817],["above",2084,2089],["over",2532,2536],["opposite",2546,2554],["round",2584,2589]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0510638298,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973948002},{"para_id":2,"paragraph":"This road is probably a great thoroughfare for cattle, as at several places on it we found semicircular inclosures formed for collecting water, and into which the cattle are driven to drink.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["road",5,9],["water",137,142]],"pos_words":[["great",24,29]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",148,152]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0625,"vader_sentiment":0.62,"roberta_sentiment":0.996966064},{"para_id":3,"paragraph":"On the road to Penrith( which we took for the purpose of making a tour to the lakes in Cumberland and Westmorland), we fell in with large droves of cattle, consisting for the most part of young oxen, proceeding from the Highlands of Scotland to the pastures of the south, for the purpose of being fattened. Lap Lane, a large farm-house, consisting of several extensive buildings, belonging to the duke of Devonshire, with the house connected with it, all built in the same style with flat slate roofs and yellow painted walls, has a very splendid appearance at a distance. Before reaching Penrith, on a high hill to the left of the road, we perceive an old tower, called Penrith Beacon, which formerly served as a beacon or watch tower, and from which there is an excellent view of the surrounding country. The town itself bears in the appearance of its houses, traces of great antiquity. We found it very animated in consequence of its market. The greatest curiosity in the place is the giant's grave, in the church-yard, close to the church, which has been so often described. There are two sand-stone pillars of eleven feet and a half in height, round at the tower end, but square at the top, and terminating in a point, which has suffered from the influence of the weather and time, and on which the marks of a carved cross are still perceptible. They are fifteen feet from each other. Between them, four elliptical stones, with ornaments almost wholly destroyed by time, rise out of the earth, and have the appearance of marking out lengthwise, the limits of a long grave. The church itself has been rebuilt in latter times on the old foundation. The castle, situated without the town, is a quadrangular building, of which the walls on the south side are all that now remains. Richard Iii. Frequently resided in it. Buildings for cattle have lately been fitted up in the ruins.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Penrith",15,22],["Cumberland",87,97],["Westmorland",102,113],["Scotland",233,241],["Devonshire",405,415],["Penrith,",589,597],["Penrith",671,678],["Beacon",679,685]],"geonouns":[["road",7,11],["lakes",78,83],["farm",325,329],["house",330,335],["buildings",369,378],["house",426,431],["walls",520,525],["hill",608,612],["road",632,636],["tower",657,662],["beacon",714,720],["tower",730,735],["country",798,805],["town",811,815],["houses",854,860],["market",937,943],["church",1010,1016],["church",1036,1042],["stone",1098,1103],["tower",1162,1167],["top",1191,1194],["point",1217,1222],["stones",1420,1426],["church",1582,1588],["castle",1656,1662],["town",1685,1689],["building",1709,1717],["walls",1732,1737]],"pos_words":[["splendid",538,546],["excellent",764,773],["great",872,877],["greatest",949,957]],"neg_words":[["fell",119,123],["suffered",1234,1242],["limits",1554,1560],["ruins",1876,1881]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["eleven feet and a half",1115,1137],["fifteen feet",1360,1372]],"loc_advs":[["left",620,624],["there",752,757],["without",1673,1680]],"spa_preps":[["close",1023,1028],["round",1149,1154],["out",1481,1484],["out",1534,1537]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.76,"roberta_sentiment":0.9949004054},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"From Penrith we proceeded to Pooley, a little village at the northern end of the lake of Ulleswater, where we found a good inn, and the necessary conveniencies for an excursion on the lake.

As we approach the village the banks of the lake begin to rise and to appear before us in their beauty. The walk along the banks to the place where the boats are stationed is highly agreeable. Opposite to us the verdant northern shore, embellished by a succession of country seats, rises in the form of an amphitheatre. At the entrance of the lake stands the lofty and well wooded Helwellyn, at the foot of which a handsome bridge over the Emont leads into Cumberland, whilst the gray rocks rising above each other in the most picturesque manner, beneath which the road winds along, bound the southern side of the river. Our boat, with the assistance of the current, carried us rapidly along the calm and crystal lake, past the elegant houses, the white walls of which appear through the fruit and flower-gardens that surround them, and add greater beauty and harmony to the scene. We will not attempt to deny that we heartily envied Messrs. Stay, Scott, and Marshall, for their mansions. The last-mentioned individual is said to have purchased his house with a piece of land worth 20,000, for a very small sum from the duke of Norfolk, a few years ago, at a moment when his grace had become liberal over the bottle. The house is situated in a group of trees on a point of land, where the lake forms, toward its middle, a strong bend to the north-west; and consequently affords a double prospect, whilst the other mansions only have a view of one half of the lake. We landed not far from it, to view Liulph's tower, a hunting lodge belong to the duke of Norfolk, which is situated on the highest point of the shore. It bears a perfect resemblance to an ancient castle, and contains some handsome apartments, from which there is a beautiful view of the lake. Behind and beside it, there is an extensive park, called Gowbarrow park, where fallow-deer are seen feeding in peaceful union with black cattle. In the garden the Airey forms the water-fall of Airey Force, which although somewhat picturesque( as it is about sixty feet in height), foes not produce any great effect, as the mass of water is not sufficiently large. There is a small wooden bridge over the lower part of the fall, from which we can see the stream dashing past us. We were very much inclined to have proceeded towards Patterdale, on the western part of the lake, which is said to contain most beautiful views; but we wished to return in good time to Penrith, in order to quit it at an early hour next morning. We therefore turned back about four o'clock, favoured with the most delightful weather. The lake was smooth as a mirror; the mountains, among which Helvellyn majestically raised his mighty head, were lighted up by the rays of the evening sun, and the pleasant dwelling-houses on the banks of the lake, surrounded with meadows of the softest green, and fruitful fields, were re - flected on the peaceful bosom of the lake.

Its environs are uncommonly wild and picturesque. We saw it first from the eastern side, where it spreads itself out between its islands, and does not appear to be above three or four miles in length, which agrees with the reality. The view of these beautiful islands, five in number, which appear like so many inviting resting places scattered over its surface, is truly grand. They are all covered with wood, and afford one of the most lovely prospects imaginable. On the other side of the lake, the mountains rise in an amphitheatrical form, with every gradation of shade caused by their distance, or the lighter or darker colour of the woods with which they are covered. The waters which form the first considerable fall, that bears the name of barrow Fall, trickle down the sides of the mountains along which we proceed. The fall itself is very pretty, but unfortunately, it is concealed by too much brush-wood. Barrow hall, the very elegant seat of Mr. Pocklington, built among the rocks by which it is shaded, is situated near to the fall. Beside it we perceive the celebrated Fall of Lodore. It is principally remark - able on account of its being impeded in its course by innumerable rocks and stones, thrown in its way by the hand of nature: over these it precipitates itself in numerous little streams, and hurries on to the lake. Nature is very romantic round this fall, which has its source in the chain of mountains forming the eastern boundary of the lake. On all sides it is over-hung by pines and firs, and the hand of art has neither added to nor detracted from the beauty of the scene. Here too we can conveniently clamber over the rocks which lie in it, and, as at Dunkeld, we had a peculiar pleasure in seating ourselves on an elevated one in the middle of the fall, and seeing the water raging past us on all sides. At a small distance from this we cross the Grange bridge, over the River Derwent, which falls into the lake, whence we have a noble view of this body of water; which with all its islands, lies stretched out before us in its whole extent from north to south. A little islet, thickly covered with trees, seems to repose on the bosom of the lake, close to the bridge, and appears to have been brought thus near to the point of view, that we might examine it more attentively. We now enter the gloomy vale of Borrow Dale, a ravine in which, surrounded by high rocks, we can see nothing but rocks and cliffs in every direction. To the right lies Castle Craig, a rock partly covered with wood; from the top of which there is said to be an extensive prospect over the valley. Opposite to this rock, and in the valley itself, lies the Bowther Stone, a piece of rock, which has probably at some former period detached itself from the neighbouring rocks, and rushed down into the valley. It is sixty - two feet in length, thirty - six feet high, and eighty - nine feet in circumference. By means of a ladder fixed against its side we are enabled to reach its top, and we could not resist the desire of ascending it. The position of this stone is singular. It has fallen on one of its corners, on which it now stands, like a die resting on one of its angles.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Keswick",43,50],["Barrow",1025,1031],["Lodore",1200,1206],["Grange",1989,1995],["River Derwent",2013,2026],["Castle",2587,2593]],"geonouns":[["post",63,67],["lake",102,106],["islands",237,244],["islands",368,375],["wood",513,517],["lake",600,604],["mountains",610,619],["woods",748,753],["waters",787,793],["mountains",900,909],["wood",1019,1023],["hall",1032,1036],["seat",1055,1059],["rocks",1096,1101],["rocks",1301,1306],["stones",1311,1317],["streams",1413,1420],["lake",1444,1448],["mountains",1528,1537],["lake",1574,1578],["rocks",1759,1764],["water",1911,1916],["bridge",1996,2002],["falls",2034,2039],["lake",2049,2053],["water",2099,2104],["islands",2125,2132],["trees",2241,2246],["lake",2284,2288],["bridge",2303,2309],["point",2361,2366],["vale",2443,2447],["rocks",2502,2507],["rocks",2532,2537],["rock",2603,2607],["wood",2628,2632],["top",2643,2646],["valley",2707,2713],["rock",2732,2736],["valley",2749,2755],["rock",2799,2803],["rocks",2884,2889],["valley",2916,2922],["top",3095,3098],["stone",3173,3178]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",145,156],["beautiful",358,367],["like",406,410],["grand",480,485],["afford",523,529],["lovely",546,552],["lighter",716,723],["pretty",958,964],["elegant",1047,1054],["celebrated",1181,1191],["romantic",1465,1473],["beauty",1692,1698],["conveniently",1729,1741],["pleasure",1820,1828],["noble",2072,2077],["right",2576,2581],["like",3253,3257]],"neg_words":[["wild",136,140],["darker",727,733],["fall",828,832],["fall",938,942],["unfortunately",970,983],["hung",1604,1608],["detracted",1673,1682],["lie",1771,1774],["peculiar",1811,1819],["raging",1917,1923],["lies",2134,2138],["gloomy",2436,2442],["lies",2582,2586],["lies",2764,2768],["fallen",3199,3205],["die",3260,3263]],"events":[],"dates":[["our quarters",27,39],["the fall",1145,1153],["this fall",1480,1489],["the middle of the fall",1872,1894]],"times":[],"distances":[["three or four miles",278,297],["sixty - two feet",2930,2946],["thirty - six feet",2958,2975],["eighty - nine feet",2986,3004]],"loc_advs":[["past",1924,1928],["there",2656,2661]],"spa_preps":[["round",92,97],["out",221,224],["between",225,232],["above",272,277],["over",453,457],["down",878,882],["along",910,915],["among",1086,1091],["near",1137,1141],["over",1360,1364],["round",1474,1479],["over",1599,1603],["over",1750,1754],["over",2004,2008],["into",2040,2044],["out",2149,2152],["close",2290,2295],["near",2349,2353],["over",2698,2702],["down",2902,2906],["into",2907,2911],["against",3050,3057]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0035335689,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987915158},{"para_id":12,"paragraph":"The black lead mine in Borrow Dale, which in order to keep the lead scarce, was only occasionally opened, is said to be now quite exhausted; at least we were told so by our postillion.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["lead",10,14],["lead",63,67]],"neg_words":[["scarce",68,74],["exhausted",130,139]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.42,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9956467748},{"para_id":13,"paragraph":"On our return from Borrow Dale, we crossed the Derwent, on the opposite bank of which we found an elegant little house entirely overgrown with ivy; before it a pretty little garden full of beautiful roses, fronting the high road.

The whole consists of one large hall, divided into the exhibition chamber and the work-shop: the first is filled with landscapes in oil and water-colours, and with coloured plates representing views of the lakes and their environs: the water-colour drawings are in the manner of Varley's, but very much inferior to them. Several of these drawing were executed by Mr. Green's daughter, who, like all his children, is obliged to assist him in colouring the landscapes which he engraved. We availed ourselves of our stay at Keswick to introduce ourselves to the celebrated Robert Southey, the poet laureate. Without being provided with a letter of introduction to him, as is customary in England, I went straight to his house, which is situated at the extremity of the town, and close to the bridge over the Greta. He received me at first, as I thought, with some embarrassment, which after a quarter of an hour's conversation, gave way to a most agreeable frankness, that never left him for a moment till I parted. I was introduced by him to a Mrs. Barker and her family, who are his near neighbours, and with whom he appears to be on the most friendly footing; Mr. Koster, a young gentleman of Dutch extraction, born in Lisbon, and educated in Brazils, whose father is at the head of a considerable mercantile house at Liverpool, made one of the company. This gentleman lives with Mr. Southey, of whose society he availed himself, with the view of literary improvement. He is the person whose travels in Brazil have been several times translated in Germany. We expressed a wish to Mr. Southey, to become acquainted with his library, which had been described to us as exceedingly rich, he did not hesitate a moment to gratify it; and I must confess that my expectations have seldom been so far surpassed. The collection consists of between 3 and 4000 volumes of the most select works in the Spanish and Portuguese languages, in the departments of history, statistics, and voyages and travels, of which the last mentioned are partly the fruits of a literary journey in Spain and Portugal, and partly the legacy of an uncle who bequeathed to him the works collected by him while chaplain to the English factory at Lisbon. Mr. Southey's library does not contain merely printed books, but also manuscripts, both of histories and itineraries, of many of which he has already in part availed himself, in his classical work on the history of Brazil. I shall always consider the pleasant evening I passed in Mr. Southey's family, as one of the most happy sections of our tour, more especially as I obtained this piece of good fortune without any introduction to, or any previous acquaintance with that celebrated man.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Keswick",14,21],["Keswick",711,718],["England",875,882],["Greta",995,1000],["Liverpool",1508,1517],["Spain",2256,2261]],"geonouns":[["house",117,122],["church",155,161],["town",184,188],["hall",222,226],["landscapes",308,318],["water",330,335],["lakes",396,401],["water",426,431],["landscapes",645,655],["house",907,912],["town",956,960],["bridge",979,985],["head",1465,1469],["house",1499,1504]],"pos_words":[["like",148,152],["work",272,276],["like",580,584],["celebrated",749,759],["agreeable",1134,1143],["friendly",1332,1340],["educated",1421,1429],["improvement",1646,1657],["exceedingly",1856,1867],["rich",1868,1872],["gratify",1906,1913],["works",2066,2071],["works",2336,2341],["work",2600,2604],["pleasant",2659,2667],["happy",2729,2734],["good",2801,2805],["fortune",2806,2813],["celebrated",2882,2892]],"neg_words":[["inferior",493,501],["embarrassment",1051,1064],["confess",1929,1936]],"events":[],"dates":[["the middle of the",166,183],["a quarter of an hour",1078,1098],["3",2028,2029]],"times":[["five o'clock",39,51],["evening",2668,2675]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",22,29],["left",1166,1170],["between",2020,2027],["without",2814,2821]],"spa_preps":[["into",236,240],["close",966,971],["over",986,990],["near",1272,1276]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0650406504,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9952589869},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"See his\" Letters written during a Journey in Spain, and a short residence in Portugal.\" London, 1808.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Spain",45,50],["London",88,94]],"geonouns":[["residence",64,73]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["1808",96,100]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9978941083},{"para_id":18,"paragraph":"Among the manuscripts, the following I conceive are deserving of particular mention, as curious and remarkable. \" Relaciones de Taboada\" 4 vols.

Passing the grave of the last king of Cumberland, said to be distinguishable by a heap of stones, called Dunmaile Raise, not far from the road, we came to a ravine, enclosed on both sides by rocks, down whose sides fell numberless streamlets, preparing us for the view of the lovely Grasmere, which although one of the least and most inconsiderable, may nevertheless be considered among the most beautiful and picturesque of the lakes. It lies in a bottom formed by high mountains, as if secluded from the rest of the world; and its lovely verdant shores, and the little thickly wooded islet in its centre, have charms for those only, who know how to prize its beauties. Mr. Johnson's house, a pretty little villa, on its western bank, enjoys a situation which has few equals. From Grasmere, the road leads to another little lake, called Rydal Water, connected with Grasmere by a narrow natural canal. Being less secluded than Grasmere, Rydal Water appears to be more related to the world, and more bustling. Two islands rise above the surface of this lake, and two waterfalls attract our attention, both of which descend from the hills at a small distance from an elegant villa on the banks of the lake, formerly belonging to Sir Peter le Fleming, but now in possession of a Mr. Crump, of Liverpool. Not far from Rydal, there is a considerable slate quarry, belonging to Lord Lonsdale, which supplies the adjoining country with slates for roofs.

The remaining part of this front is lighted by a large arched window on each side. In the second story the projection above mentioned supports a balcony enclosed by iron rails of very neat workmanship. A glass cupola, rising from the centre of the building, appears to give light to the rooms behind the projection. On our return from the house we met the colonel's handsome yacht proudly gliding through the water, in full sail, with the British ensign and pendant hoisted, and with the colonel himself at the helm as steersman. A yacht belonging to Mr. Pedder, a landholder, and neighbour to the colonel, and fitted out in a similar manner, likewise glided past us.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Bolton",139,145],["Great Britain",394,407]],"geonouns":[["park",37,41],["country",105,112],["seat",113,117],["points",170,176],["land",180,184],["lake",204,208],["pier",276,280],["pier",487,491],["building",525,533],["country",825,832],["building",873,881],["house",950,955],["lake",1079,1083],["door",1142,1146],["building",1427,1435],["house",1518,1523],["water",1588,1593]],"pos_words":[["handsome",313,321],["noble",519,524],["elegant",574,581],["beautiful",586,595],["grandeur",763,771],["admirably",1001,1010],["gentle",1090,1096],["supports",1313,1321],["neat",1363,1367],["handsome",1545,1553]],"neg_words":[["useless",642,649],["confined",674,682],["object",714,720],["neglect",776,783]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of",285,295]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",302,307],["there",630,635],["above",1297,1302],["behind",1472,1478],["past",1838,1842]],"spa_preps":[["through",13,20],["into",195,199],["opposite",209,217],["round",477,482],["about",863,868],["through",1576,1583],["out",1797,1800]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0363636364,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983372688},{"para_id":31,"paragraph":"As the thunder storm of the preceeding day had prevented us from visiting the Station before mentioned, we now availed ourselves of our present excursion to repeat our visit to the western bank of the lake, and had no reason to repent the loss of time it occasioned. A winding path leads up to the entrance of the garden, which looks like the gate of an ancient Gothic castle. The garden itself seems in some measure to have been gained from the rock, for projections from it still extend into the walks, and enter the clusters of flowers which art has here planted. The house is two stories in height, and built entirely in the Gothic castle style, but to judge from its appearance, is nevertheless very suitable for habitation. The lower story contains a handsome and spacious dining room, looking towards the lake, to which the surrounding trees communicate a pleasing gloom. In the upper story there is a large drawing room, the walls of which are hung round with landscapes, representing mountain and water scenery, in the manner of Alberti. The windows are filled with stained glass, through which the landscape appears of every possible colour excepting the natural. From the top of the hill we were enabled to view the whole northern part of the lake, with its noble environs, and an almost uninterrupted succession of country seats along its banks; among these were Mr. Pringle's and Mr. Taylor's villas opposite to us; and Calgarth, the seat of the venerable Dr. Watson, Bishop of Landaff, lately deceased; Mr. Harden's possession; and New Ambleside, the splendid villa of Mr. Harrison, the building of which is not yet finished.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Calgarth",1433,1441],["Ambleside",1550,1559]],"geonouns":[["bank",189,193],["lake",201,205],["winding",269,276],["path",277,281],["entrance",298,306],["gate",343,347],["castle",369,375],["rock",446,450],["house",571,576],["castle",636,642],["lake",812,816],["trees",843,848],["walls",933,938],["landscapes",968,978],["mountain",993,1001],["water",1006,1011],["landscape",1108,1117],["top",1183,1186],["hill",1194,1198],["lake",1254,1258],["country",1327,1334],["seats",1335,1340],["banks",1351,1356],["seat",1447,1451],["building",1601,1609]],"pos_words":[["leads",282,287],["like",334,338],["gained",430,436],["suitable",705,713],["handsome",757,765],["spacious",770,778],["pleasing",863,871],["noble",1269,1274],["splendid",1565,1573]],"neg_words":[["loss",239,243],["gloom",872,877],["hung",952,956]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",39,42]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",553,557],["there",898,903]],"spa_preps":[["into",489,493],["round",957,962],["through",1090,1097],["along",1341,1346],["among",1358,1363],["opposite",1413,1421]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0397350993,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987566471},{"para_id":32,"paragraph":"After having with great difficulty torn ourselves from the lovely and never to be forgotten Winandermere, we proceeded eastward in a direct line to Kendal, and were soon at a distance from the banks of the lake.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Winandermere",92,104],["Kendal",148,154]],"geonouns":[["line",140,144],["banks",193,198],["lake",206,210]],"pos_words":[["great",18,23],["lovely",59,65]],"neg_words":[["difficulty",24,34]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0625,"vader_sentiment":0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9952564836},{"para_id":33,"paragraph":"Kendal, a little town, of about 7000 inhabitants, on the banks of the River Ken, over which there is an old bridge to the north of the town, contains several very pretty houses.

An excellent and handsome stone bridge of five arches, that brings us directly to the Custom House, extends itself very picturesquely across the River Lune, which forms a harbour here, and along which there is a row of handsome warehouses. This little town has a very pleasing appearance, and is even embellished by a pretty large and open place, called Dalton Square, which contains several magnificent houses. Among the objects worth seeing here, the castle claims the first place. This majestic edifice, when entire must have been one of the noblest remains of Gothic architecture in England, but it now presents only a faint resemblance of what it was in its former glory. The whole seems to have been a heptagon. Of the seven towers which protected the corners, four only remain. The front, containing the great arched gate, is still completely unimpaired, and appears in all its ancient splendour. On entering the spacious castle yard we were immediately struck with the appearance of a huge square tower to the left, called Adrian's tower, on the top of which there is a turret, known by the appellation of John of Gaunt's Chair, where there is an immense seat, wherein that renowned hero is said to have frequently sat and viewed the surrounding country. We ascend by stone stairs to two large sleeping apartments in this tower. From their height we may conceive the great elevation of the tower itself. From the thronged state of prison, instead of only sixteen or seventeen persons, which these rooms were originally intended to contain, twenty - six persons now slept in them, which is calculated to render the atmosphere of the rooms very unwholesome. From the top of the tower we looked down into the court of the prison, and were enabled to form a distinct idea of its internal arrangement. Each tower has its own peculiar division of the court in front of it, enclosed by a wall, in which the prisoners may walk at stated times, without having any communication with the prisoners of the other towers. The ground in these divisions is flagged, that it may always be kept clean, and a well supplies the prisoners with water during their walk. The two towers next to Adrian's tower, contains forty cells each; and a new one, which will contain room for 120 women, was building, for the sake of which, alas, the beautiful Gothic tower beside it was to be demolished! The number of persons confined in the different receptacles was considerable, even for a country of the extent of Lancaster; there being at this time 197 male and 53 female criminals, and 150 debtors, amounting in all to 400 persons. Of the former, 34 men and 11 women were sentenced to transportation, and on 17 no sentence had yet been passed. The allowance afforded to the prisoners, is here, as in all other English prisons, very plentiful. They receive daily one pound of bread and a penny-worth of butter; and ten pounds of potatoes and two pounds and a half of flour per week; and every Sunday one pound of meat. In the chapel, which is rather a gloomy room, the culprits have seats within gratings. We found the prayer-books fastened to the desks. The courts of justice in the castle are very magnificent. The civil, or nisi prius court, is as usual, of a semi-circular form, and wholly in the Gothic style. Cross arches run from the pillars between the windows to the centre of the room, whilst the pillars themselves are connected with each other by similar arches above the windows. The room is ornamented by two beautiful portraits, as large as life, of Lord Stanley and Mr. Blackburne, the members for Lancashire. The second court( or crown court) forms an oblong square, supported by five Gothic double pillars. A broad staircase runs down into the court, on which the public stand during the trials. A picture of George Iii. on horseback, is hung opposite to the entrance. The room appropriated to the deliberations of the grand jury, which is evidently an imitation of the chapter-houses of cathedrals, and the record's room, are in the same style as that of the court; the latter is circular with a hand - some cupola, and lighted from above. The view from the towers is very extensive; and the new bridge before-mentioned( built by Mr. Harrison, the able architect who also conducted the transformation of the castle), appears here to very great advantage. A walk surrounded with a stone balus trade runs round the castle, which presents several points, whence the environs of the city may be seen. The church, a beautiful Gothic building of an oblong form, in the style of the fifteenth century, is situated on a lower elevation, and only separated from the castle by the most. Its interior is carefully white-washed. The organ appears to be a very good one. The church seats, which are on each side of the altar( a very unusual position), are ornamented with curious carved work in wood, apparently of a very ancient date.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["Kendal",23,29],["Lancaster",34,43],["River Lune",288,298],["Dalton",497,503],["England",730,737],["Lancaster",2636,2645],["Lancashire",3737,3747],["George",3950,3956]],"geonouns":[["country",7,14],["stone",169,174],["bridge",175,181],["town",395,399],["houses",547,553],["castle",596,602],["towers",874,880],["gate",967,971],["castle",1072,1078],["tower",1148,1153],["tower",1183,1188],["top",1197,1200],["seat",1306,1310],["country",1397,1404],["stone",1419,1424],["tower",1473,1478],["tower",1541,1546],["tower",1827,1832],["tower",1953,1958],["wall",2032,2036],["towers",2152,2158],["ground",2164,2170],["water",2275,2280],["towers",2308,2314],["tower",2332,2337],["building",2424,2432],["tower",2484,2489],["country",2611,2618],["chapel",3149,3155],["seats",3206,3211],["castle",3307,3313],["entrance",4000,4008],["houses",4119,4125],["towers",4300,4306],["bridge",4338,4344],["castle",4450,4456],["stone",4522,4527],["castle",4555,4561],["points",4586,4592],["church",4643,4649],["building",4670,4678],["castle",4799,4805],["church",4904,4910],["seats",4911,4916],["wood",5024,5028]],"pos_words":[["great",55,60],["attractive",91,101],["excellent",146,155],["handsome",160,168],["handsome",362,370],["pleasing",411,419],["pretty",461,467],["magnificent",535,546],["worth",573,578],["majestic",632,640],["glory",813,818],["great",954,959],["spacious",1063,1071],["immense",1298,1305],["renowned",1325,1333],["hero",1334,1338],["great",1518,1523],["top",1816,1819],["clean",2229,2234],["well",2242,2246],["beautiful",2467,2476],["plentiful",2956,2965],["worth",3017,3022],["magnificent",3323,3334],["beautiful",3646,3655],["supported",3807,3816],["grand",4060,4065],["great",4480,4485],["advantage",4486,4495],["beautiful",4653,4662],["good",4890,4894],["work",5016,5020]],"neg_words":[["faint",766,771],["struck",1104,1110],["prison",1582,1588],["prison",1870,1876],["peculiar",1971,1979],["confined",2544,2552],["gloomy",3175,3181],["hung",3979,3983],["unusual",4962,4969]],"events":[],"dates":[["seventeen",1617,1626],["forty",2348,2353],["11",2782,2784],["17",2832,2834],["daily",2980,2985],["week",3100,3104],["Sunday",3116,3122],["the fifteenth century",4714,4735]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",15,22],["there",44,49],["across",277,283],["here",322,326],["there",344,349],["here",586,590],["left",1161,1165],["there",1210,1215],["there",1286,1291],["without",2087,2094],["beside",2490,2496],["there",2647,2652],["here",2912,2916],["above",4275,4280],["here",4467,4471]],"spa_preps":[["along",332,337],["down",1843,1847],["into",1848,1852],["next to",2315,2322],["within",3212,3218],["between",3472,3479],["above",3597,3602],["down",3871,3875],["into",3876,3880],["opposite",3984,3992],["round",4545,4550]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0514541387,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986732006},{"para_id":41,"paragraph":"See an account somewhat different in Warner's Reisen durch das wordlichs England, von Kuttner, vol. 2. p. 140.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[["England",73,80]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["2",100,101]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9731929302},{"para_id":42,"paragraph":"The building of the Bridge cost \u00a3 12,000, and that of the prison \u00a3 40,000.","file_id":"1816_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["building",4,12]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["prison",58,64]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.125,"vader_sentiment":-0.51,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9977071285}]
