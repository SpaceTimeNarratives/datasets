But a particular subject cannot, I think, much interfere with a general one; and I have been further kept from encroaching upon any right Mr. C. may still wish to exercise, by the restriction which the frame of the Sonnet imposed upon me, narrowing unavoidably the range of thought, and precluding, though not without its advantages, many graces to which a freer movement of verse would naturally have led.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["banks",524,529],["ground",654,660]],"pos_words":[["poetic",229,235],["right",1016,1021],["advantages",1206,1216],["led",1286,1289]],"neg_words":[["limits",95,101],["disturbance",214,225],["interfere",931,940],["restriction",1064,1075],["unavoidably",1133,1144]],"events":[],"dates":[["the 14th",388,396],["more than twenty years ago",733,759]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",119,124],["without",607,614],["without",1194,1201]],"spa_preps":[["within",83,89],["above",311,316]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0085470085,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9951099753},{"para_id":97,"paragraph":"May I not venture, then, to hope, that instead of being a hinderance, by anticipation of any part of the subject, these Sonnets may remind Mr. Coleridge of his own more comprehensive design, and induce him to fulfil it.-- There is a sympathy in streams,\" one calleth to another;\" and, I would gladly believe, that\" The Brook\" will, ere long, murmur in concert with\" The Duddon.\" But, asking pardon for this fancy, I need not scruple to say, that those verses must indeed be ill-fated which can enter upon such pleasant walks of nature, without receiving and giving inspiration.

This recess, towards the close of September, when the after-grass of the meadows is still of a fresh green, with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but perhaps none fallen, is truly enchanting. At a point elevated enough to show the various objects in the valley, and not so high as to diminish their importance, the stranger will instinctively halt. On the fore-ground, a little below the most favourable station, a rude foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook foaming by the way-side. Russet and craggy hills, of bold and varied outline, surround the level valley, which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch trees. A few home-steads are interspersed, in some places peeping out from among the rocks like hermitages, whose site has been chosen for the benefit of sun-shine as well as shelter; in other instances, the dwelling-house, barn, and byre, compose together a cruciform structure, which, with its embowering trees, and the ivy clothing part of the walls and roof like a fleece, call to mind the remains of an ancient abbey. Time, in most cases, and nature everywhere, have given a sanctity to the humble works of man that are scattered over this peaceful retirement. Hence a harmony of tone and colour, a consummation and perfection of beauty, which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered with the course of convenience, utility, or necessity. This unvitiated region stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise its features. As it glistens in the morning sunshine, it would fill the spectator's heart with gladsomeness. Looking from our chosen station, he would feel an impatience to rove among its pathways, to be greeted by the milk-maid, to wander from house to house, exchanging\" good-morrows\" as he passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the sun is set, and a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky, with an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows; when the trees are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable; when the cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the cottage-chimneys; when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep in the bed of the foaming Brook; then he would be unwilling to move forward, not less from a reluctance to relinquish what he beholds, than from an apprehension of disturbing, by his approach, the quietness beneath him. Issuing from the plain of this valley, the Brook descends in a rapid torrent passing by the churchyard of Seathwaite. The traveller is thus conducted at once into the midst of the wild and beautiful scenery which gave occasion to the Sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive. From the point where the Seathwaite brook joins the Duddon is a view upwards into the pass through which the river makes its way into the plain of Donnerdale. The perpendicular rock on the right bears the ancient British name of The Pen; the one opposite is called Walla Barrow Crag, a name that occurs in other places to designate rocks of the same character.

His eldest brother, who inherited the small family estate, died at Under Crag, aged ninety - four, being twenty - four years older than the subject of this Memoir, who was born of the same mother. Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender health, it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to breed him a scholar; for it was not likely that he would be able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour. At that period few of these Dales were furnished with schoolhouses; the children being taught to read and write in the chapel; and in the same consecrated building, where he officiated for so many years both as preacher and schoolmaster, he himself received the rudiments of his education. In his youth he became schoolmaster at Lowes Water; not being called upon, probably, in that situation to teach more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. But, by the assistance of a\" Gentleman\" in the neighbourhood, he acquired, at leisure hours, a knowledge of the classics, and became qualified for taking holy orders. Upon his ordination, he had the offer of two curacies; the one, Torver, in the vale of Coniston,-- the other, Seathwaite, in his native vale. The value of each was the same, viz. five pounds per annum: but the cure of Seathwaite having a cottage attached to it, as he wished to marry, he chose it in preference. The young person on whom his affections were fixed, though in the condition of a domestic servant, had given promise, by her serious and modest deportment, and by her virtuous dispositions, that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself. By her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money, with which they began housekeeping. In 1735 or 1736, he entered upon his curacy; and, nineteen years afterwards, his situation is thus described, in some letters to be found in the Annual Register for 1760, from which the following is extracted:","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[["Crag",50,54],["Seathwaite",59,69],["Crag",184,188],["Lowes Water",914,925],["Torver",1262,1268],["Seathwaite",1308,1318],["Seathwaite",1416,1426]],"geonouns":[["country",462,469],["chapel",704,710],["building",740,748],["vale",1277,1281],["vale",1334,1338],["cottage",1436,1443]],"pos_words":[["delicate",391,399],["tender",410,416],["best",439,443],["qualified",1164,1173],["holy",1185,1189],["cure",1408,1412],["promise",1619,1626],["modest",1647,1653],["virtuous",1677,1685],["worthy",1713,1719]],"neg_words":[["died",170,174],["sickly",321,327]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year 1709",3,16],["twenty - four years",216,235],["so many years",774,787],["1735",1916,1920],["1736",1924,1928],["nineteen years",1963,1977],["1760",2078,2082]],"times":[["leisure hours",1109,1122]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["through",341,348],["out",1803,1806]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0454545455,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9932556152},{"para_id":119,"paragraph":"Page 326.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9935279489},{"para_id":120,"paragraph":"To Mr.____ Coniston, July 26. 1754. \" Sir,","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[["Coniston",11,19]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["July 26",21,28],["1754",30,34]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9720861912},{"para_id":121,"paragraph":"\" I was the other day upon a party of pleasure, about five or six miles from this place, where I met with a very striking object, and of a nature not very common.

Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less eager. Entrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants,&amp; c., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his employers.

His garden also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his attendance; with this pastoral occupation he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to his own less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["seat",293,297],["table",347,352],["school",389,395],["country",1357,1364],["mountains",1551,1560],["fields",1851,1857]],"pos_words":[["extraordinary",42,55],["like",372,376],["master",410,416],["benefit",643,650],["eager",933,938],["gain",1146,1150],["great",1174,1179],["benefit",1180,1187],["great",1404,1409],["right",1523,1528]],"neg_words":[["urgent",252,258],["mistress",396,404],["waste",838,843],["intense",1380,1387]],"events":[],"dates":[["each day",148,156],["five days",165,174],["the week",178,186],["Saturday",200,208],["one period of the year",1251,1273],["between Christmas and",1280,1301]],"times":[["eight hours",133,144],["Every evening",518,531],["school hours",539,551],["the night",1418,1427],["nights",1449,1455]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",16,21],["within",302,308]],"spa_preps":[["out",1068,1071]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0372670807,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9960469604},{"para_id":141,"paragraph":"He also assisted his neighbours in hay-making and shearing their flocks, and in the performance of this latter service he was eminently dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a hay-cock, or a fleece; less as a recompence for this particular service than as a general acknowledgment. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church were also duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he indulged himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine. The frugality and temperance established in his house were as admirable as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of the decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning. And it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit, remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands. It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours, consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The lights by which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords. White candles, as tallow candles are here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were perhaps produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during the proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the year, was salted and dried for winter provision: the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes.-- By these various resources, this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he affectingly says,\" from wanting the necessaries of life;\" but affording them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in society.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["house",828,833],["cottage",1438,1445],["chapel",1588,1594],["chapel",1726,1732],["house",1865,1870],["cottages",2113,2121],["house",2201,2206],["mountain",2441,2449]],"pos_words":[["dexterous",136,145],["holy",352,356],["work",613,617],["admirable",842,851],["luxury",898,904],["comely",1265,1271],["decent",1276,1282],["thrifty",1418,1425],["remarkable",1557,1567],["neatly",1636,1642],["distinguished",1736,1749],["delicate",1808,1816],["modern",1835,1841],["like",1872,1876],["work",2019,2023],["proper",2391,2397]],"neg_words":[["strict",334,340],["incessantly",589,600],["worn",1242,1246],["killed",2461,2467]],"events":[],"dates":[["Sunday",362,368],["day",533,536],["the week",540,548],["every week",558,568],["the year",572,580],["Saturday",687,695],["the winter",1992,2002],["Christmas",2294,2303],["a month",2371,2378],["season",2398,2404],["the year",2527,2535],["winter",2562,2568]],"times":[["afternoon",696,705]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",924,929],["elsewhere",1171,1180],["home",1317,1321],["here",2253,2257]],"spa_preps":[["through",513,520],["through",550,557],["into",1003,1007],["into",1350,1354],["close",2518,2523]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0512820513,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9982448816},{"para_id":142,"paragraph":"It might have been concluded that no one could thus, as it were, have converted his body into a machine of industry for the humblest uses, and keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon secular concerns, without grievous injury to the more precious parts of his nature. How could the powers of intellect thrive, or its graces be displayed, in the midst of circumstances apparently so unfavourable, and where, to the direct cultivation of the mind, so small a portion of time was allotted? But, in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were reconciled. His conversation was remarkable, not only for being chaste and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and eloquent; his written style was correct, simple, and animated. Nor did his affections suffer more than his intellect; he was tenderly alive to all the duties of his pastoral office: the poor and needy\" he never sent empty away,\"-- the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing that unfrequented vale,-- the sick were visited; and the feelings of humanity found further exercise among the distresses and embarrassments in the worldly estate of his neighbours, with which his talents for business made him acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs confided to him were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience from religious obligation. Nor could such conduct fail to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or custom: they felt convictions which, but for such intercourse, could not have been afforded, that as in the practice of their pastor there was no guile, so in his faith there was nothing hollow; and we are warranted in believing that upon these occasions selfishness, obstinacy, and discord would often give way before the breathings of his good-will and saintly integrity. It may be presumed also, while his humble congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he delivered from the pulpit, and to the Christian exhortations that they should love their neighbours as themselves, and do as they would be done unto-- that peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher's labours by recollections in the minds of his congregation that they were called upon to do no more than his own actions were daily setting before their eyes.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["precious",239,247],["thrive",303,309],["extraordinary",501,514],["remarkable",589,599],["chaste",620,626],["pure",631,635],["fervent",672,679],["eloquent",684,692],["correct",716,723],["tenderly",809,817],["refreshed",940,949],["talents",1158,1165],["impartiality",1227,1239],["faith",1660,1665],["good",1838,1842],["saintly",1852,1859],["humble",1906,1912],["love",2050,2054]],"neg_words":[["bent",175,179],["concerns",193,201],["grievous",211,219],["injury",220,226],["adverse",543,550],["suffer",770,776],["poor",870,874],["needy",879,884],["stranger",919,927],["sick",991,995],["fail",1428,1432],["guile",1643,1648],["hollow",1684,1690],["selfishness",1752,1763],["discord",1780,1787],["peculiar",2128,2136]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",2299,2304]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",203,210],["there",1630,1635],["there",1666,1671]],"spa_preps":[["into",89,93],["among",1062,1067]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0111111111,"vader_sentiment":0.52,"roberta_sentiment":0.9945207834},{"para_id":143,"paragraph":"The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously attended than that of the morning, but by a more serious auditory; the lesson from the New Testament, on those occasions, was accompanied by Burkitt's Commentaries. These lessons he read with impassioned emphasis, frequently drawing tears from his hearers, and leaving a lasting impression upon their minds. His devotional feelings and the powers of his own mind were further exercised, along with those of his family, in perusing the Scriptures; not only on the Sunday evenings, but on every other evening, while the rest of the household were at work, some one of the children, and in her turn the servant, for the sake of practice in reading, or for instruction, read the Bible aloud; and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone through. That no common importance was attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family, appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants, which I am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic and somewhat curious. \" There is a small chapel in the county palatine of Lancaster, where a certain clergyman has regularly officiated above sixty years, and a few months ago administered the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the same, to a decent number of devout communicants. After the clergyman had received himself, the first company out of the assembly who approached the altar, and kneeled down to be partakers of the sacred elements, consisted of the parson's wife, to whom he had been married upwards of sixty years; one son and his wife; four daughters, each with her husband; whose ages, all added together, amount to above 714 years. The several and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more than 1000 English miles.

We have seen him congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any denomination. Some allowance must be made for the state of opinion when his first religious impressions were received, before the reader will acquit him of bigotry, when I mention that at the time of the augmentation of the cure, he refused to invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to him upon advantageous terms, because the proprietor was a quaker;-- whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the church between persons not in religious sympathy with each other; or, as a seeker of peace, he was afraid of the uncomplying disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in that sect. Of this an instance had fallen under his own notice; for, while he taught school at Loweswater, certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay, or be distrained upon, for the accustomed annual interest due from them, among others, under the title of church stock; a great hardship upon the incumbent, for the curacy of Loweswater was then scarcely less poor than that of Seathwaite. To what degree this prejudice of his was blamable need not be determined;-- certain it is, that he was not only desirous, as he himself says, to live in peace, but in love, with all men. He was placable, and charitable in his judgments; and, however correct in conduct and rigorous to himself, he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses of others, and to soften the censure that was cast upon their frailties.-- It would be unpardonable to omit that, in the maintenance of his virtues, he received due support from the partner of his long life. She was equally strict, in attending to her share of their joint cares, nor less diligent in her appropriate occupations. A person who had been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives, concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me,\" She was no less excellent than her husband; she was good to the poor; she was good to everything!\" He survived for a short time this virtuous companion. When she died, he ordered that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters and one granddaughter; and, when the corpse was lifted from the threshold, he insisted upon lending his aid, and feeling about, for he was then almost blind, took hold of a napkin fixed to the coffin; and, as a bearer of the body, entered the chapel, a few steps from the lowly parsonage.","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[["Loweswater",948,958],["Loweswater",1192,1202],["Seathwaite",1244,1254]],"geonouns":[["church",664,670],["school",938,944],["church",1123,1129],["chapel",2554,2560]],"pos_words":[["cure",164,168],["cure",400,404],["advantageous",494,506],["blessing",597,605],["benefit",649,656],["peace",749,754],["great",1139,1144],["desirous",1368,1376],["peace",1409,1414],["love",1423,1427],["charitable",1464,1474],["correct",1506,1513],["ready",1562,1567],["support",1759,1766],["diligent",1883,1891],["appropriate",1899,1910],["excellent",2079,2088],["good",2115,2119],["good",2141,2145],["virtuous",2196,2204]],"neg_words":[["zealously",19,28],["bigotry",332,339],["refused",409,416],["apprehension",577,589],["afraid",763,769],["conspicuous",838,849],["fallen",888,894],["refused",1001,1008],["hardship",1145,1153],["scarcely",1212,1220],["poor",1226,1230],["prejudice",1276,1285],["censure",1623,1630],["omit",1697,1701],["strict",1818,1824],["mistress",2036,2044],["poor",2127,2131],["died",2225,2229],["blind",2462,2467],["lowly",2583,2588]],"events":[],"dates":[["annual",1059,1065]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["between",671,678],["under",895,900],["among",1090,1095],["under",1104,1109],["about",2432,2437]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9855727553},{"para_id":145,"paragraph":"What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated, and, in point of worldly wealth, poorly-repaid Churchman, present to that of a Cardinal Wolsey!","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["point",64,69]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["poorly",89,95]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0909090909,"vader_sentiment":0.54,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9963133931},{"para_id":146,"paragraph":"\" O' tis a burthen, Cromwell,' tis a burthen Too heavy for a man who hopes for heaven!\"","file_id":"1820_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["heaven",79,85]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0909090909,"vader_sentiment":0.48,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9931266308},{"para_id":147,"paragraph":"We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral world, that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated ground in which this venerable pair lie interred.
