His restless activity and unceasing energy through a life of more than ordinary vicissitude and duration, form a not altogether uninteresting episode in the chapter of local biography. Embarking from India in his twenty - second year, he there entered the service of the Hon. East India Company, was present at the taking of Surat Castle, which happened soon after his arrival, and for his gallant conduct on that occasion received a speedy promotion. For some time subsequently he commanded a vessel fitted out for the protection of ships trading along the coast from the attacks of the pirates, at that time very numerous and destructive to the Company's property. Becoming dissatisfied with the usage he met with from those of his present rank, with whom his personal bravery had placed him on an equality, while they had not attained their position without many years of service, he left India with disgust, and on his return to this country obtained a situation in the Customs in Northumberland. This he held for some years, but his health suffering much here he resolved upon settling in his native town, which he did, not much better in circumstances than when he left it. In 1780 he conceived the project of establishing a Museum for the entertainment of visitors to the Lakes, just then becoming more frequented every year. By dint of much labour and perseverance he finally succeeded in collecting a Museum, which still stands unrivalled, as a private collection, in the north of England. His ingenuity increased his resources; these he always spent upon his favourite object. He surveyed eight of the principal lakes, and published maps, with stations for good prospects, roads, sounding&amp; c., accurately marked out. These went through many editions, and proved a profitable speculation. The Eolian Harp, still sold by his successor at the Museum, a stringed instrument of simple but ingenious construction, much admired for its sweetness of tone, was of his invention. In 1785 he discovered, in the sandbeds of the River Greta, the first set of musical stones ever found. He remembered from a boy that these stones were possessed of a musical sound, and went for the purpose of procuring a good sounding stone to contrast with bell metal, when, to his delight, he found they sounded one a note above another. He collected two octaves, which are still exhibited in the museum, upon which a variety of tunes can be played. He was the first inventor of the life-boat, but lost the reward due to him in the following manner; Having communicated to a ship-builder at Shields the principle of its construction, and asked his opinion as to whether it would pay him to take a patent, he was discouraged by him, and, relinquishing that plan, submitted a model of his invention to Lord Sandwich, at that time First Lord of the Admiralty, who requested him to leave it for the consideration of the board. While his model was lying here unnoticed, a boat-builder in the employ of the ship-builder to whom he had applied, brought out a boat exactly on the principle he had explained to him, and reaped a reward of \u00a3 1200 from Government. He entered a protest, made two journeys to London, was referred from one government office to another, in search of his model, which, however, was never forthcoming. In the Star, London Newspaper, of May 1800, an advertisement is contained offering a reward of its recovery. In the same paper appears a list of the advertiser's many curious and useful inventions; models of these are kept in the museum. Of the various classes of objects in the Museum, we cannot do more than give a very brief notice. It is rich in ancient British, Roman, Saxon, and Norman antiquities, illustrating the early history of the district; contains a fine collection Roman and early English coins.

The several processes of carding, spinning, dying, and weaving, were then principally performed by hand labour, forming part of the daily labours of the respective members of most households in the surrounding rural districts, and even down to a comparatively recent period, long subsequent to that which witnessed the gradual development and application of scientific invention to manufacture in other parts of the Kingdom, the hand-cards and spinning wheel formed part of the necessary utensils of the farmstead. Keswick was, at that time, the emporium of the woollen trade for Cumberland, and much resorted to at annual fairs and markets, its yarns and cloths forming a considerable item of exportation to the neighbouring towns of this and the adjoining county of Westmorland. Alluding to this staple of manufacture, we remember to have seen a rude distich cut in large clear letters in a flagstone, and originally designed, it may be supposed, for one of these manufactories.

They consisted solely of those used by artists, still manufactured here, and known in the trade as pure Barrowdale lead. The number of hands now employed in the manufacture in Keswick is about one hundred and thirty. As a moderate computation, made from sufficient data, the quantity produced by these workmen annually, and sent out to all parts of the world, cannot be less than ten millions of pencils, which are now sold, we believe, at from one shilling and sixpence per gross and upwards. As may readily be supposed great mechanical skill has been brought to bear upon this extended production. The circular saws, with planes at right angles to each other, performing the twofold operation of cutting out the wood and grooving it ready to receive the lead, twelve hundred of which can be cut out by one man per hour, are made to revolve two thousand times a minute.

It forms one of the polling places for the Western Division of the County, and is included in the Third Circuit of County Court Towns, under the recent act for the recovery of small debts. Various etymologies of its name have been suggested, but the most probable, and, from its purely local character, naturally the most readily entertained by the natives of the district, is the following:-- Kesh, a local appellative for Water Hemlock, and Wic or Wick( Ang. Sax.), a Station or Village. Assuming this to be the true derivation, we have Kes(h) wick, The Village by the Sedges.

Secluded from the more accessible and fertile parts of our island, the Lake Land furnishes but few topics of interest to our early historians. Although the extended intercourse of the progressive civilization of later centuries has tended much to obliterate the distinctions of race, the large admixture of Celtic blood still discernible throughout the whole of the district, but more especially in the secluded dales, together with the prevalence of the ancient British language in its topographical nomenclature, fully bear out history in ascribing to it the character of a place of refuge for the unsubdued Britons retiring before the Saxon and Danish invaders. These, it is probable, remained in a state of comparative rudeness of dress, manners, speech, and mode of livelihood, long after the more open country had felt the influence of the Norman conquest. The strife of civil war, too, and the contests of the nobles with the crown, it is well known were carried on at a distance from this part of the country; hence the almost night-like silence that reigns in the pages of history over the rocky regions of Cumberland, throughout a period during which history was little more than a chronicle of warfare and feuds of bloodshed. Nor, descending to a later period, does it appear that the Scots marauders preferred their raids through mountain fastnesses, where they were liable at any moment to have been surprised by a fierce foe, who held not out in their undoubtedly scanty possessions the tempting offers of a rich plunder. How long the Parish Church was built before the twelfth century is uncertain. A list of rectors is preserved, dating from about the close of the thirteenth. The mines in the neighbourhood of Keswick were known in the time of Henry Iii., as appear by the close rolls of that reign. The privilege of the market was procured for the town from Edward I. by Sir John de Derwentwater, Lord of the place. Edward Iv. granted a charter for working the mines. In the 2nd of Elizabeth, the mine of Goldscope, in Newlands, was made the subject of a memorable trial between the crown and Thomas Percie, Earl of Northumberland, Lord of the Manor of the Derwent Fells. The gold and silver in this vein being proven of more value than the copper and lead, by virtue of the prerogative royal the mine was adjudged to be a royal mine, and the property of the crown; by whom it was carried on under commissioners. These commissioners would appear to have exercised a considerable share of influence in the direction and management of local affairs, during this, and two succeeding reigns.","file_id":"1852_b","plnames":[["Lake District",86,99],["Cumberland",1266,1276],["Parish Church",1699,1712],["Keswick",1877,1884],["Derwentwater",2051,2063],["Elizabeth",2150,2159],["Goldscope",2173,2182],["Newlands",2187,2195],["Northumberland",2284,2298],["Derwent Fells",2325,2338]],"geonouns":[["common",38,44],["region",72,78],["island",209,215],["district",516,524],["dales",562,567],["country",958,965],["country",1159,1166],["regions",1255,1262],["mountain",1492,1500],["market",1988,1994],["town",2016,2020]],"pos_words":[["accessible",173,183],["fertile",188,195],["progressive",334,345],["well",1096,1100],["like",1191,1195],["tempting",1651,1659],["rich",1672,1676],["privilege",1971,1980],["memorable",2223,2232],["gold",2344,2348],["proven",2379,2385],["lead",2420,2424],["virtue",2429,2435],["succeeding",2737,2747]],"neg_words":[["obliterate",397,407],["strife",1017,1023],["rocky",1249,1254],["bloodshed",1376,1385],["liable",1529,1535],["fierce",1578,1584],["foe",1585,1588],["plunder",1677,1684],["uncertain",1753,1762]],"events":[],"dates":[["later centuries",362,377],["the twelfth century",1730,1749],["the 2nd",2139,2146]],"times":[["almost night",1178,1190]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["throughout",488,498],["throughout",1278,1288],["between",2239,2246]],"spa_preps":[["together",569,577],["out",676,679],["over",1240,1244],["through",1484,1491],["out",1603,1606],["about",1808,1813],["close",1818,1823],["close",1940,1945],["under",2560,2565]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0217391304,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9982782602},{"para_id":53,"paragraph":"Camden found Keswick inhabited by miners.

The number of inhabitants would necessarily fluctuate with the state of mining operations in the neighbourhood, at one period increasing, at others decreasing. Agues and fevers of a character happily now unknown, arising from the vicinage of extensive swamps and undrained marsh lands, periodically visited and carried off a portion of the inhabitants. This must have rendered the average of human life much lower than in our own times, notwithstanding the assertions of the angel, by no means seldom to be met with in the district, who lament over the physical degeneracy and fancied decay of their species. The visitation of the plague, too, would appear to have more than once swept away the inhabitants in such numbers, if we can pay any attention to local tradition, that generations must have grown up and passed away before the complement was renewed. The registers of Crosthwaite Church show the number of interments for the year 1623 to have been no less than 258, probably a tenth, or at most, one - twelfth; of the whole population of the parish at that time.

A Sir John de Derwentwater resided here in the reign of Edward I., and the head of the house held the name of Sir John in the reign of Edward Iii. Margaret, the daughter and heiress of the latter, was married to Sir Nicholas Ratcliffe, of Dilston, Northumberland. The estates of the house of Derwentwater thus came into the possession of the Ratcliffs. Sir Thomas Ratcliffe,( son and representative of Sir Nicholas,) married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Parr, of Kendal Castle, and had issue, six sons. Sir Francis, the sixth in lineal descent from Sir Thomas, was created by James Ii. Baron of Dilston, Viscount, Langley and Ratcliffe, and Earl of Derwentwater, by reason of the marriage of his son, the second Earl, to Lady Mary Tudor, a natural daughter of Charles Ii. James, the third Earl, espoused the daughter of Sir John Webb, Dorsetshire, and left issue, a son and a daughter, the latter born in 1716, after her father's untimely death. The son died in France at the age of nineteen, from injuries received while riding o horseback. The daughter was married to Lord Petre in 1732. The widowed Countess died in France at about the age of thirty, and was buried at Louvaine. Charles Ratcliffe, brother of the unfortunate Earl, condemned to execution, May 8, 1716, for participating in the rebellion, contrived to effect his escape from Newgate, in company with Forster and some others, and got safe to France. Here, after living in a state of indigence for some time, he attached himself to the fortunes of the Pretender, and subsisted on a pension allowed him by that Prince. In 1724 he married Lady Charlotte Livingstone, Countess of Newburgh, in her own right. He secretly visited England twice, but sought in vain to obtain a pardon. In 1745 he engaged ardently in the cause of the Prince Charles, and was taken prisoner in a French vessel, loaden with arms and ammunition, intended for the insurgents in Scotland. After lying a year in confinement, he was brought before the Bar of the King's Bench, his former sentence was read to him, and having raised in vain a curious question of identity, which for a time perplexed the officers of the crown, he was beheaded at Tower Hill, 8th December, 1746, in the fifty - fourth year of his age. On the attainder of the Earl, in 1716, the large possessions of the family were confiscated to the Crown, by whom they were held, under trustees, until 1735, when they were bestowed upon Greenwich Hospital by George Ii. These possessions, which are now said to be of the yearly rental of more than \u00a3 60,000, are situated in the Counties of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Durham. The Cumberland portion was purchased a little more than twenty years ago by the late John Marshall jun. Esq., Leeds. The Earl of Newburgh, the descendent of Charles Ratcliffe, petitioned parliament for a reversal of the attainder, but he only succeeded in obtaining, as a compensation for some claim he had upon the lands, an annuity of \u00a3 2500.

Whe this holy priest heard of St. Cuthbert's coming to Lugubalia( Carlisle), he came after his usual manner, desiring to be comforted more and more with the hope of everlasting bliss, by his divine exhortations. As they sate together, and enjoyed the hopes of heaven, among other things, the bishop said,' Remember, brother Herbert, that whatsoever ye have to say, and ask of me, you do it now, for after we depart hence, we shall not meet again, and see one another corporeally in this world; for I know well the time of my dissolution is at hand, and the laying aside of this earthly tabernacle draweth on apace.' When Herberte heard this, he fell down at his feet, and, with many sighs and tears, beseeched him, for the love of the Lord, that he would not forsake him, but to remember his faithful brother and associate, and make intercession with the gracious God, that they might depart hence into heaven together, to behold His grace and glory whom they had in unity of spirit served on earth; for you know I have ever studied and laboured to live according to your pious and virtuous instructions; and in whatsoever I offended or omitted, through ignorance and frailty, I straightway used my earnest efforts to amend after your ghostly will and counsel.' At this earnest and affectionate request of Herbert's, the bishop went to prayer, and presently being certified in spirit that his petition to heaven would be granted,--' Arise,' said he,' my dear brother, weep not, but let your rejoicing be with exceeding gladness; for the great mercy of God hath granted unto us our prayer.' The truth of which promise was well proved in that which ensued; for their separation was the last that beheld them on earth; on the same day, which was the 19th day of March, their souls departed from their bodies, and were straight in union in the beatific sight and vision, and were transported hence to the kingdom of heaven, by the service and hands of angels.\"","file_id":"1852_b","plnames":[["Cuthbert",178,186],["Farn Island",190,201],["River Derwent",346,359],["Cuthbert",382,390],["Cuthbert",492,500],["Lugubalia",513,522],["Carlisle",524,532]],"geonouns":[["isle",284,288],["lake",316,320],["fell",1103,1107],["feet",1120,1124]],"pos_words":[["perfect",75,82],["spiritual",218,227],["love",228,232],["great",297,302],["holy",467,471],["desiring",567,575],["everlasting",623,634],["bliss",635,640],["divine",649,655],["enjoyed",697,704],["heaven",718,724],["well",963,967],["love",1181,1185],["faithful",1250,1258],["gracious",1313,1321],["heaven",1361,1367],["grace",1392,1397],["glory",1402,1407],["unity",1425,1430],["virtuous",1540,1548],["earnest",1657,1664],["earnest",1728,1735],["affectionate",1740,1752],["heaven",1863,1869],["rejoicing",1949,1958],["exceeding",1967,1976],["gladness",1977,1985],["great",1995,2000],["mercy",2001,2006],["promise",2067,2074],["well",2079,2083],["heaven",2370,2376]],"neg_words":[["dissolution",983,994],["forsake",1217,1224],["ignorance",1612,1621],["weep",1926,1930]],"events":[],"dates":[["every year",391,401],["the same day",2177,2189],["the 19th day of March",2201,2222]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["together",683,691]],"spa_preps":[["among",726,731],["aside",1022,1027],["down",1108,1112],["into",1356,1360],["together",1368,1376],["through",1604,1611]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1272727273,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9960391521},{"para_id":105,"paragraph":"\" It is probable,\" says Hutchinson, whom we have followed in this account,\" the hermit's little oratory or chapel might be kept in repair after his death, as a particular veneration appears to have been paid by the religious of after ages to this venerable retreat, and the memory of the Saint.

Though this name is now commonly applied to the stream throughout its whole course, from its extreme source in the mountains to the place where it loses its water in those of the Derwent below Keswick, the Greta, it may be necessary to inform some of our readers, is, properly speaking, formed by the junction of tw small rivers, the Glendera Neekin, or as it is sometimes written, the Glendera Makin, and the Bure. The former of these has its source in Threlkeld Tarn, situated on the northern declivities of Blencathra, and, winding round Souterfell, flows through the Vales of Grisedale and Threlkeld, draining those vales and surrounding mountains by means of numerous tributaries.

At Threlkeld Bridge the two unite and form a stream of respectable volume, which thence takes the name of the Greta, and finds its way down a deep and narrow glen, the scenery of which is in many places of the most highly picturesque description.

From Rakefoot will readily be found a track leading to the open ground of Castlerigg Fell, where, crossing the wall by means of a stile, the summit will be gained by pushing a short distance through a rising plantation.

Soon after entering the wood beyond the latter, a deviation of a few yards to the right of the road will reveal a stupendous scene from the precipice formed by Thrang Crag. One mile from this place Watendlath Vale is entered. The road winds up the middle of this vale for about a mile and a-half to the small hamlet of Watendlath, consisting of a few old-fashioned farm buildings, the occupants of which will gladly accord rest to the traveller before commencing the toilsome ascent of High Ladder Brow. While the reader is, therefore, enjoying a short breathing, we shall take the opportunity of laying before him a description of the scenery through which he has just passed, from the pen of Mr. Gilpin.

Left Cockshut( which we formerly mounted) and Castle Hill, a lofty and more rugged hill behind me, and drew near the foot of Walla Crag, whose bare and rocky brow cut perpendicularly down above four hundred feet( as I guess, though the people called it much more) awfully overlook the way. Our path here tends to the left, and the ground gently rising and covered with a glade of scattering trees and bushes on the very margin of the water, opens both ways the most delicious view that my eyes ever beheld; opposite are the thick woods of Lord Egremont and Newland Valley, with green and smiling fields embosomed in the dark cliffs; to the left the jaws of Borrowdale, with that turbulent chaos of mountain behind mountain, rolled in confusion; beneath you, and stretching far away to the right, the shining purity of the lake reflecting rocks, woods, fields, and inverted tops of hills, just ruffled by the breeze, enough to show it is alive, with the white buildings of Keswick, Crosthwaite Church, and Skiddaw for a background in the distance. Behind you the magnificent heights of Walla Crag; here the glass played it part divinely, the place is called Carf Close Reeds(\" Scarf Close Bay\") and I chose to set down these barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, and easily find the particular station that I mean. This scene continues to Barrow Gate; and a little further, passing Barrow Beck, we entered Borrowdale; the Crags named Lodore Banks begin now to impend terribly over your way, and more terribly when you hear that two years since, an immense mass of rock tumbled at once from the brow, and barred all access to the dale( for this is the only road) till they could work their way through it. Luckily no one was passing at the time of this fall, but down the side of the mountain, and far into the lake, lie dispersed the huge fragments of this ruin in all shapes and in all directions: something farther we turned into a coppice, ascending a little in front of Lodore Waterfall; the height appeared to be about two hundred feet, the quantity of water not great, though( these three days expected) it had rained daily in the hills for near two months before. On one side a towering crag that spired up to equal, if not overtop the neighbouring cliffs( this lay all in shade and darkness); on the other hand a rounder, broader projecting hill shagged with wood, and illuminated by the sun, which glanced sideways on the upper part of the cataract. The force of the water wearing away a deep channel in the ground, hurries away to join the lake. We descended again and passed the stream over a rude bridge.
