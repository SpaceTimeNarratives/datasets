One of the most striking of these incidents, so related by Mr. Fell, was that of his coming upon the poet - his illustrious neighbour and life-long friend, seated under Hammerscar Spouting, gesticulating and apostrophizing the Aurora Borealis, that with unusual splendour, was shooting and glancing over the lofty summits of Seat Sandle and Helvellyn. It was a treat to hear Mr. Fell describe this encounter, but then he was an educated man with well cultivated tastes and appreciative sympathies, and his less intellectual neighbours, in humble life, regarded such outbursts of poetic enthusiasm with widely different words. One instance of the odd misconstruction they put upon these demonstrations, which I think is worthy of record, was told me by a well known and talented portrait painter, who, while executing commissions at Ambleside, used to find his temporary studio made use of as a favourite lounging place by the men of leisure thereabout. Amongst the most welcome of these loungers was the late Hartley Coleridge, who then, and down to the time of his death, resided at the Nab Cottage on Rydal Water. Making his wonted appearance at my friend's painting room one morning, Hartley was accosted with the common salutation of\" Well, Mr. Coleridge what's your news this morning?\" and replied,\" Your enquiry reminds me of the answer I've just had to the same. As I was walking down I came upon a poor man from Rydal, breaking stones, and like you I said' good morning John, what news have you this morning?' and John answered,' Why nowte varry particlar, only \u0101ld Wadsw\u016brth's brocken lowce ageean?'\"\" you must know,\" proceeded Coleridge,\" that the Poet Laureate's muse is not always in a propitious mood; and occasionally, when he is in the throes of composition, he goes about the lanes boo-oo-oo-ing away - and the country people believe that what are really fits of inspiration, are paroxysms of insanity.\" This is curiously borne out by a similar anecdote that appeared many years ago in Chamber's Journal, in a short but well written series of papers on the lake country. The writer, as well as I recollect, said, that while resting in a cottage at Rydal, he asked the chatty old mistress of the house if Wordsworth made himself neighbourly amongst them, and she replied,\" Well, he sumtimes ga\u00f9s booing his pottery about t' rooads an' t' fields an' taks na nooatish o' ne\u00e0body; but at udder times he'll say good morning, Dolly, as sensible as oyder you or me!\" These anecdotes are interesting, as giving us a glimpse of the manner in which a great master worked at his craft. It is well-known that Wordsworth took more than usual pains and trouble in elaborating and finishing his productions after they were composed, and it is very probable that these frequent mutterings and mouthings, which the people about, very naturally, took for indications of mental aberration were outward signs of the process of polishing and refining which his compositions, already worked off, were undergoing in the mind of their Author.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[["Ambleside",54,63],["Helvellyn",818,827],["Ambleside",1309,1318],["Rydal Water",1580,1591],["Rydal",1897,1902],["Rydal",2641,2646],["Wordsworth",2697,2707],["Wordsworth",3090,3100]],"geonouns":[["district",175,183],["summits",791,798],["common",1694,1700],["stones",1913,1919],["lanes",2269,2274],["country",2304,2311],["lake",2550,2554],["country",2555,2562],["cottage",2630,2637],["house",2688,2693],["fields",2830,2836]],"pos_words":[["well",78,82],["romantic",124,132],["worked",197,203],["delighted",322,331],["fancy",393,398],["pleasure",417,425],["excite",469,475],["striking",493,501],["illustrious",589,600],["educated",905,913],["well",923,927],["appreciative",950,962],["humble",1016,1022],["poetic",1056,1062],["enthusiasm",1063,1073],["worthy",1196,1202],["well",1231,1235],["talented",1246,1254],["welcome",1447,1454],["like",1925,1929],["good",1942,1946],["propitious",2175,2185],["inspiration",2356,2367],["well",2513,2517],["well",2579,2583],["good",2899,2903],["sensible",2923,2931],["interesting",2973,2984],["great",3034,3039],["master",3040,3046],["worked",3047,3053],["well-known",3074,3084],["worked",3455,3461]],"neg_words":[["primitive",165,174],["unusual",731,738],["outbursts",1043,1052],["odd",1123,1126],["death",1543,1548],["poor",1883,1887],["breaking",1904,1912],["insanity",2386,2394],["mistress",2672,2680],["pains",3122,3127],["trouble",3132,3139]],"events":[],"dates":[["many years ago",2461,2475]],"times":[["one morning",1651,1662],["this morning",1753,1765],["morning",1947,1954],["this morning",1980,1992],["morning",2904,2911]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["away",2289,2293]],"spa_preps":[["under",640,645],["over",776,780],["down",1519,1523],["down",1864,1868],["about",2259,2264],["out",2421,2424],["amongst",2733,2740],["about",2807,2812],["about",3298,3303]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0696202532,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9930121303},{"para_id":199,"paragraph":"Another of these stories and then we'll try another subject,-- When the poet died, which he did at a ripe age. a lady neighbour told the news to an old man working in her garden.

The dwelling-house at Mosses was, like most farm-houses at that time, thatched, and all the rooms were on the groundfloor. Much hospitality was practised at that day to all visitors; but in this instance Joe was freely admitted, and Jack thought it better to wait till most of the family retired, as he was not much of a favourite with the seniors. He did his best to discover what went on inside; and, as had been the case on former occasions, a fine piece of beef was brought out for Joe's refreshment. Jack had made some provision in anticipation of this, and mounted the roof as silently as possible, whilst Joe did his best at the beef and in occupying the attention of the family, though he could hardly restrain his laughter at the expected result. However, he succeeded so well that no remark was made, until some bits of straw fell from the thatch upon the table, which was noticed by a brother of the girls, and attributed by him and Joe Wright to rats in the thatch. For a short space suspicion was quelled, but quickly a long pole, armed with a hay-crook, was pushed down, struck into the beef, and up it went. The family stood amazed, watching the ascent of the beef, when, just as it was about to disappear through the roof, the hook tore out its hold, and down came the beef upon the broad pewter dish, and laid it, small stand-table and all, prostrate on the clay floor. All rushed towards the door, but Joe Wright contrived to be first there; and while apparently struggling to open the door with his hands, was eagerly pressing it close with his foot, and exclaiming that some one held it outside.

At an early hour in the morning, a woman of the company, noted as a keen hand, began to boast of her cleverness and success. By and bye she held three aces in one hand, and was so overjoyed that she exclaimed she was now a match for the devil! The next moment a horse was heard to gallop fiercely up to the door; and, on its being opened, a gentlemanly-looking man alighted, and requested that his horse might be taken to the stable, the request being at once complied with. The horse was remarked to be an exceedingly fine animal, coal black, and with a peculiar fierceness in its look. It seemed to have been hard ridden, and suffered itself to be quietly tied up, but not without the servant exhibiting signs of fear on being near him, and of joy on closing the stable door after leaving the horse. The gentleman was dressed in black, and on seeing the occupation of the company, requested permission to join their sport. This request was acceded to, and he made himself agreeable to all by his hearty good humour. He was invited to sit at the table next to the woman who had been so successful, and he took a hand with them. His luck or cleverness enabled him soon to draw all her winnings, as well as most of the cash from nearly all present. Amid their surprise and confusion attendant on seeing their money disappear so quickly, and in their eagerness to have a return of luck, time was forgotten, Sunday morning advanced, and every one was more than usually intent on his or her hand of cards. By some accident, a card fell on the floor, and on one of the company taking a candle to look for the card, his eye accidentally glanced on the gentleman's feet, and observed( what none had seen before) that one of them was a club-foot.

No doubt, wise women were consulted; but nothing availed, and the disease spread quickly. Preventives were next looked for, and a rumour got afloat that the Needfire was coming from the eastern parts of the country. At first none knew what the Needfire was to be or to do, only it was said to be a charm to check the ravages of the murrain; and in the panic some were afraid we should be in danger of suffocation from the smoke, or of being burnt up by the fire - so outrageous were the exaggerated stories about it. After a few days of mystery and much talk, columns of smoke were seen to arise to eastward, to become more numerous, and to approach day by day. Information came in advance that it was to stay the plague. Where it was first kindled no one could tell, but it was said to have been originated in Yorkshire by some one rubbing two pieces of dry, half - rotten wood together till they took fire, and that there it had worked wonders. The fire was not to be suffered to go out, nor to be taken into any house, or the charm would be lost, till got up again in the same way; and the greater the smoke, the stronger the charm. Having been from home one day, I was not a little surprised, on returning in the evening, to observe a grass field near my house so trampled with cattle, that herbage was scarcely visible on it; and, without much enquiry, was quickly informed that Needfire had been in use. I had previously scouted the idea, and directed that it should not be admitted; and was inclined to feel annoyed that my orders should have been disobeyed. This feeling was soon dispersed when I was told that John Steel, of Whitekeld farm, who had been an old and valued servant with my father, had brought the fire direct, with the haste of the\" hot-trod\" of ancient border warfare, from the last kindling; and, with great pride and bustle, would neither taste\" bite nor sup\" till the fire was lighted in the field, and the men sent out to draw in the cattle. His proceedings had at first been strongly objected to, but he had seemed so much cast down by the refusal, that consent had been given on the score that if no good came of it, no harm was likely to be done; and all knew his intentions to be good, and his anxiety for the welfare of his old master's family was beyond doubt. So the business went on. As the fire rose, it was plied with weeds, old thatch, rushes, brushwood, or any kind of fuel that had never been in a house, and heaped again and again with whatever of that character was at hand and best adapted for raising a great smoke. The great smoke was partly levelled in one direction by a gentle breeze, and the men crowded the cattle into it, and drove them in a continual ring, sun-wise, through it; while John continued the hot-trod to the next neighbour, and so on with it, till relieved by some one willing to take his place. The ring driving was repeated till the poor animals began to sneeze, and then to cough - and so did the men - till cattle and men were nearly suffocated, and then the play ceased. Then it was thought the old man's directions had been fully carried out, and the charm was left to do its work, if it was to work at all. The cattle were driven staggering to their several places by the men, wondering at the strange incantations - some impressed with fear, others( unbelievers) scoffing at the ceremony, and railing not a little at the outrageous smoking they had undergone. However, the charm was not effectual in this instance, for the herd was invaded by the disease on more occasions than one during that summer; but by a careful system of isolating, it did not extend to any great numbers.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[["Yorkshire",894,903]],"geonouns":[["country",290,297],["wood",957,961],["house",1098,1103],["field",1328,1333],["house",1342,1347],["farm",1727,1731],["field",2003,2008],["house",2523,2528]],"pos_words":[["wise",93,97],["charm",381,386],["worked",1014,1020],["wonders",1021,1028],["charm",1112,1117],["stronger",1199,1207],["charm",1212,1217],["hot",1840,1843],["great",1911,1916],["pride",1917,1922],["good",2214,2218],["good",2296,2300],["master",2345,2351],["best",2605,2609],["great",2632,2637],["great",2649,2654],["gentle",2703,2709],["breeze",2710,2716],["wise",2798,2802],["hot",2841,2844],["willing",2918,2925],["charm",3206,3211],["work",3231,3235],["work",3250,3254],["impressed",3378,3387],["charm",3530,3535],["effectual",3544,3553],["great",3722,3727]],"neg_words":[["doubt",86,91],["panic",435,440],["afraid",451,457],["danger",474,480],["smoke",505,510],["outrageous",550,560],["mystery",620,627],["smoke",654,659],["plague",797,803],["rotten",950,956],["suffered",1053,1061],["lost",1127,1131],["smoke",1188,1193],["scarcely",1390,1398],["annoyed",1598,1605],["haste",1826,1831],["refusal",2153,2160],["harm",2234,2238],["anxiety",2310,2317],["doubt",2372,2377],["smoke",2638,2643],["smoke",2655,2660],["crowded",2730,2737],["poor",2984,2988],["strange",3350,3357],["fear",3393,3397],["outrageous",3478,3488]],"events":[],"dates":[["a few days",606,616],["day",733,736],["day",740,743],["one day",1241,1248],["the\"",1835,1839],["that summer",3646,3657]],"times":[["the evening",1296,1307]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",67,74],["together",962,970],["there",1001,1006],["home",1236,1240],["near",1334,1338],["without",1419,1426],["left",3216,3220]],"spa_preps":[["about",590,595],["out",1068,1071],["into",1089,1093],["out",2027,2030],["down",2141,2145],["beyond",2365,2371],["into",2749,2753],["through",2804,2811],["out",3193,3196]],"normalised_sentiment":0.003125,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9977498651},{"para_id":469,"paragraph":"Since that time no smoking by Needfire has been practised to my knowledge, although numerous instances of foot-and-mouth disease have occurred in various years.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["foot",106,110],["mouth",115,120]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["various years",146,159]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.3,"roberta_sentiment":0.6288689375},{"para_id":470,"paragraph":"Cattle Charms.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.44,"roberta_sentiment":0.9931983352},{"para_id":471,"paragraph":"There are other matters of superstition which have escaped the notice of both Bourne and Brand, or are not recorded in their elaborate works on popular antiquities and superstitions.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["works",135,140],["popular",144,151]],"neg_words":[["superstition",27,39]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0833333333,"vader_sentiment":0.44,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9865766764},{"para_id":472,"paragraph":"Old people of two generations ago have said it was a practice formerly with owners of cows subject to abortion( and which malady is often known to continue nearly three years in a herd), to watch for the first abortive calf shewing signs of life, and to dig a hole under the threshold of the byre, and bury the calf in it - alive, if possible; but there to bury it, alive or dead.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["malady",122,128],["dead",375,379]],"events":[],"dates":[["two generations ago",14,33],["nearly three years",156,174]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",348,353]],"spa_preps":[["under",265,270]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0526315789,"vader_sentiment":-0.41,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9763750434},{"para_id":473,"paragraph":"A still more barbarous practice was to take the first living aborted calf, and at midnight to burn it alive.

Osborne Littledale, who was long curate of Buttermere, was a native of Whillimoor, and was born and brought up at High Toot Hill, in the parish of Arlecdon, of which Whillimoor forms one of four townships. His father was a dry-stone waller, and managed to afford his son a clerical education at St. Bees, on the products of his daily labour, and of his estate of eighteen high-lying acres, tilled by his own hand. The young man was tall and robust, and although fond of and skilled in athletic sports, he did not neglect his education. Of a good figure, he might be thought a little too uncouth for the ministry of a populous parish. His manners were of the homeliest character, and his very dark complexion, rather repulsive features, and a somewhat disagreeable squint with one eye, would in some measure disqualify him attaining to celebrity as a popular clergyman in polished society. But popular he was in his ministry at Buttermere; for he was strong and active, willing, and ready to put his hand to work when his neighbours were in need of help; and having been brought up to farm work, nothing of that kind came amiss to him. The place almost appeared as if made for him, or he made for it, and for the people, by whom he was looked up to as a friend and favorite, as he truly was. His ordinary dress was becoming for his week-day work, consisting of a drab fustian coat, corduroy knee-breeches, grey stockings of the coarsest yarn, with clogs or strong calkered shoes, stuffed with dried brackens, and hat, brown, bare, and crumpled. In climbing or descending the steep mountains, calkers are as indispensible to the Cumberland shepherd, and others whose business leads them to frequent excursions on the fells, as the alpen-stock and spiked shoes are to the members of the Alpine Club. And the brackens, where straw was scarce, and such ample foot-room given in shoes as was the custom of the day, made a shoe or clog of any reasonable size hang well on the foot, when aided by good iron clasps.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[["Buttermere",48,58],["St. Bees",300,308],["Buttermere",932,942],["Cumberland",1632,1642]],"geonouns":[["parish",142,148],["stone",232,237],["parish",631,637],["farm",1089,1093],["mountains",1585,1594],["foot",1859,1863],["foot",1974,1978]],"pos_words":[["afford",261,267],["robust",446,452],["fond",467,471],["skilled",479,486],["good",546,550],["popular",855,862],["polished",876,884],["popular",898,905],["strong",955,961],["willing",974,981],["ready",987,992],["work",1012,1016],["work",1094,1098],["favorite",1269,1277],["work",1345,1349],["strong",1461,1467],["leads",1679,1684],["ample",1853,1858],["reasonable",1941,1951],["well",1962,1966],["good",1994,1998]],"neg_words":[["lying",382,387],["neglect",518,525],["uncouth",592,599],["dark",697,701],["repulsive",721,730],["disagreeable",756,768],["amiss",1126,1131],["drab",1367,1371],["clogs",1452,1457],["crumpled",1539,1547],["steep",1579,1584],["scarce",1836,1842],["clog",1929,1933],["hang",1957,1961]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",333,338],["week-day",1336,1344],["the day",1905,1912]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0391061453,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9953376055},{"para_id":510,"paragraph":"Parson Littledale's ability and willingness to help, always without money pay, made him a great favorite with his flock, and especially as he would undertake and perform feats of exertion that few others could accomplish.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["willingness",32,43],["great",90,95],["favorite",96,104],["accomplish",210,220]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",60,67]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.1739130435,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988260865},{"para_id":511,"paragraph":"In that neighbourhood the best peat earth is found on the mountain heights; and if any poor family wanted peats cut, and they could not afford to hire, he would volunteer a day, shoulder his spade, with bread and cheese in his pocket for dinner, and labour with or excel the best from early morn to sunset. When sledging time came, and peats were dry, he would shoulder the sledge, take it up to the top, load it and run it down, and rally those who were unable to do as he could. At the sheep-clippings he was always busily employed, and could keep the whole gathering in a roar of laughter with his stories and anecdotes; and when the work was done, could enjoy his glass without excess.

He could handle an axe, and cut down a tree and strip the bark as well as any woodman; and whatever he took in hand he did it with a will, and could show his parishioners how they ought to work. His stipend was very small when he commenced - only about \u00a3 28, and eventually it was augmented to about \u00a3 40 per annum; and to eke out a subsistance for himself and family he farmed the fishery of Buttermere lake, which would make a small addition to his income. Net and rod together( and with the latter he was an expert), he could have a dish of excellent trout in the season, when probably his means would not always afford a joint of meat, and none could be had nearer than Keswick - a journey of ten miles each way, and no carrier on the road. When char were netted( none took bait), they were sent to Keswick as the bread-winners. When a fox-hunt was organized, he was out with the first and foremost, could scale the crags with the best, and tire most of the hunt in a long day's run. Otter hunting was a favorite sport, too; and, if necessary, he could swim and dive almost as well as that animal itself. This kind of chase seldom occurred, from the scarcity of the game; but when it did happen, he enjoyed both the hunt and the fun of slyly hustling some known bully or stuck-up effeminate into the river or lake to cool, without fear of retaliation; for few durst take liberties with one of his burly frame and spirit. In his early manhood, while attending to his scholastic duties at St. Bees, he became a good wrestler and won some prizes, and used to say there was more to learn at a public school than Greek and Latin. During a holiday, he and John Sumpton, the then young parish clerk of Arlecdon, agreed to go to Egremont Crab Fair sports; when Sumpton brought away the prize for running, and the young parson the belt as the winning wrestler. Rather late in life he obtained a Lancashire curacy, with an improved stipend; but the turmoil of a busy manufacturing community, with its accessories of steam and smoke, was in no way congenial to his feelings. The population and dialect were so different from his former associations, that he became dispirited, and unable to rally against a severe attack of illness, and finally succumbed to it, leaving somewhat comfortable circumstances to his family, by an undeviating course of care and economy, without parsimony, during many years.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[["Buttermere",1334,1344],["Keswick",1615,1622],["Keswick",1744,1751],["St. Bees",2432,2440],["Egremont",2666,2674],["Lancashire",2831,2841]],"geonouns":[["mountain",58,66],["force",750,755],["tree",980,984],["lake",1345,1349],["road",1680,1684],["crags",1861,1866],["river",2245,2250],["lake",2254,2258],["school",2541,2547],["parish",2624,2630]],"pos_words":[["best",26,30],["afford",136,142],["excel",265,270],["best",275,279],["top",400,403],["work",637,641],["enjoy",658,663],["work",718,722],["available",740,749],["accomplish",762,772],["ready",840,845],["well",1007,1011],["work",1130,1134],["excellent",1485,1494],["afford",1557,1563],["winners",1765,1772],["foremost",1835,1843],["best",1876,1880],["favorite",1949,1957],["well",2022,2026],["enjoyed",2144,2151],["fun",2174,2177],["cool",2262,2266],["good",2454,2458],["won",2472,2475],["prize",2723,2728],["winning",2779,2786],["improved",2858,2866],["congenial",2982,2991],["comfortable",3213,3224]],"neg_words":[["poor",87,91],["spade",191,196],["unable",455,461],["ax",789,791],["bait",1719,1723],["scarcity",2095,2103],["bully",2207,2212],["stuck",2216,2221],["fear",2276,2280],["turmoil",2884,2891],["smoke",2961,2966],["dispirited",3099,3109],["unable",3115,3121],["severe",3141,3147],["attack",3148,3154],["illness",3158,3165]],"events":[],"dates":[["a day",171,176],["28",1196,1198],["the season",1504,1514],["a long day's",1911,1923],["a holiday",2577,2586],["many years",3326,3336]],"times":[],"distances":[["ten miles",1638,1647]],"loc_advs":[["without",674,681],["together",1412,1420],["without",2268,2275],["there",2505,2510],["without",3300,3307]],"spa_preps":[["down",424,428],["out",727,730],["down",973,977],["about",1188,1193],["about",1235,1240],["out",1268,1271],["out",1812,1815],["into",2236,2240],["away",2714,2718],["against",3131,3138]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0454545455,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983787537},{"para_id":512,"paragraph":"The Rev.

They were too cunning to leave the park beyond an easy run in; and none were suffered to hunt the outlying deer. If the hounds were stealthily laid on the scent or view, the animal made a short run, and a vigorous leap landed him at home where the hounds were not allowed to follow.

In his youth he was shepherd for his father, in Borrowdale; and in returning from the fell one misty afternoon, he heard his dog suddenly cry out as if in extreme distress. He ran in the direction of the sound, and at foot of a steep crag, he found his dog in misery indeed! A large eagle had fastened its beak on the dog's throat, a little below one ear, and one of the eagle's talons was firmly clutched in the dog's flank. The dog was howling at the top of its voice, and snapping at the bird as well as he could, but seldom getting a hold except at the edge of the wing; and the gripe of the bird was so painful that the dog soon let go his hold. The eagle held on like a bulldog, and the pair rolled one over the other, and leaped and flapped and bit and scratched so furiously, that while their strength held out, it was dangerous to part them. The shepherd saw the danger his favourite dog was in, and was not slow to pull off his long-lapped, home-made, grey duffle coat; and throwing it over the two, they enveloped themselves in its thick folds, until the dog grew weak, and began to falter in its cry. Its master watched his opportunity to tie a handkerchief round the bird's wing and pinion them over its back; and then, with his fell-pole, to wrench off the hold of the eagle, and slip his coat again over it, and to roll it therein, so as it could not harm him. He bore his prize home under one arm, and his disabled dog under the other, and kept the noble bird in confinement many years. His dog recovered with difficulty; and it would doubtless have been killed, had he not arrived in time for the rescue. He said, in the days he mentioned, eagles were not scarce in the higher mountains; and were very destructive to the sheep and lambs, as the bird in question had either driven a sheep over the crag, as they were known to do, and the fall had crushed it; or had slain it, and was feasting on it when the dog was attracted to it, and had quarrelled with the eagle for the possession of the carcase.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[["Braithwaite",47,58],["Borrowdale",160,170]],"geonouns":[["foot",330,334],["crag",346,350],["edge",669,673],["mountains",1806,1815],["crag",1926,1930]],"pos_words":[["top",565,568],["well",611,615],["like",781,785],["master",1229,1235],["prize",1500,1505],["noble",1577,1582],["doubtless",1663,1672]],"neg_words":[["fell",198,202],["cry",250,253],["distress",275,283],["steep",340,345],["misery",372,378],["gripe",695,700],["painful",720,727],["scratched",872,881],["furiously",885,894],["dangerous",939,948],["danger",984,990],["slow",1029,1033],["weak",1187,1191],["falter",1206,1212],["cry",1220,1223],["fell",1354,1358],["harm",1478,1482],["bore",1491,1495],["disabled",1534,1542],["difficulty",1638,1648],["killed",1683,1689],["scarce",1785,1791],["destructive",1831,1842],["crushed",1975,1982]],"events":[],"dates":[["About the year 1820",0,19],["many years",1603,1613],["the days",1746,1754],["the fall",1962,1970]],"times":[["afternoon",213,222]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["home",1063,1067],["home",1506,1510]],"spa_preps":[["out",254,257],["below",453,458],["over",821,825],["out",927,930],["over",1108,1112],["round",1282,1287],["over",1320,1324],["over",1426,1430],["under",1511,1516],["under",1547,1552],["over",1917,1921]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0913978495,"vader_sentiment":-0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.7458936572},{"para_id":676,"paragraph":"The Eagle Rope.","file_id":"1875_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9962425232},{"para_id":677,"paragraph":"In 1846, the late Mr. Ralph Douglas, of Keswick, said he went to live at Thornthwaite, in 1783, at fifteen years of age.
