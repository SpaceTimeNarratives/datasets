It requires no small resolution to persevere in a visit to Borrowdale, when the entrance so powerfully assaults both the eyes and ears; but your courage will be rewarded by a scene of the wildest sequestration that perhaps ever excited human curiosity. The road is by High Lodore to Grange, a pretty village, with a ruin on a spiral rock, from whence this Stone Vale is seen to great advantage. Imagination would say, that after the world was finished the rubbish was thrown here! One wonders how the inhabitants could scratch a little bread from among the stones! for the whole Vale seems made of Rocks and Stones, and it may be called the World's End without a metaphor! Nature, however, has not left it without its riches: the best, and almost the only black lead in the world is got here, in such abundance, that I have many years ago bought a pound for sixpence, though now it is sold as high as thirty shillings! The mines are shut up by strong doors, and only opened at intervals.","file_id":"1792_a","plnames":[["Lodore",85,91],["Borrowdale",406,416],["High Lodore",615,626],["Grange",630,636]],"geonouns":[["wood",36,40],["rock",106,110],["rock",114,118],["rocks",277,282],["entrance",427,435],["road",604,608],["village",647,654],["rock",680,684],["stones",904,910],["doors",1298,1303]],"pos_words":[["dashing",93,100],["persevere",382,391],["powerfully",439,449],["courage",492,499],["excited",575,582],["pretty",640,646],["great",725,730],["advantage",731,740],["wonders",832,839],["best",1077,1081],["lead",1109,1113],["abundance",1148,1157],["strong",1291,1297]],"neg_words":[["hideous",126,133],["despise",210,217],["ruin",663,667],["rubbish",803,810],["scratch",866,873]],"events":[],"dates":[["many years ago",1171,1185]],"times":[],"distances":[["two hundred feet",324,340]],"loc_advs":[["upwards",313,320],["here",822,826],["without",1000,1007],["left",1045,1049],["without",1053,1060],["here",1134,1138]],"spa_preps":[["above",9,14],["among",21,26],["over",31,35],["over",272,276],["among",894,899]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0620155039,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9936882854},{"para_id":107,"paragraph":"The Slate Quarries may also be reckoned among the natural riches of this Vale, as well as a Salt Spring near Mansety, that cures cutaneous disorders by washing: and the Morasses here are covered with wild myrtle( called Gale), that sends forth fragrant effluvia.","file_id":"1792_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["well",82,86],["fragrant",244,252]],"neg_words":[["wild",200,204]],"events":[],"dates":[["Spring",97,103]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["near",104,108],["here",178,182]],"spa_preps":[["among",40,45]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0357142857,"vader_sentiment":0.79,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985108972},{"para_id":108,"paragraph":"If prospects be your passion, climb a rock at the water-head near Hardendale Knott, and the Lake with its Islands spreads out beneath your feet.
