First we note, lying to the south east, the vale of Langdale, which will conduct the eye to the long Lake of Windermere, stretched nearly to the sands of the vast Bay in a direction from the south-east, towards the south, and we shall fix our eyes upon the vale of Coulston, running up likewise from the sea, but not as the other vallyes do, to the nave of the wheel and therefore it may not be unaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim. Looking again, with an inclination towars the west, immediately at our feet lies the vale of Duddon, in which is no Lake, but a winding stream among fields, rocks, and mountains, and terminating gits course in the sands of Duddon. The fourth vale, that of the Esk, is of the same general character as the last, yet beautifully discriminate from it by peculiar features. Its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands Mun Caster Castle, the ancient \u00a3 eat of the Penningtons, and after forming a short and narrow estuary, enters the sea below the little Town of Ravenglass. Next, almost due west, we should look down into, and along the deep valley of Wastdale, with its little chapel and a few neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn ground, intersected with stone walls, almost imperceptible. Beyond this fertile little plain, within its bed of steep mountains, lies the long, narrow, stern, and desolate Lake of Wastdale, and beyond this, a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the Irish sea. The stream, issuing from Wast Water, is called the Irt, and falls into the estuary of the River Esk. Ennerdale comes next in view, with its Lake of bold and somewhat savage shores. Its stream, the Ehen or Enna, flowing through a soft and fertile coun-try, passes the town of Egremont, and the ruins of the Castle; then seeming to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast, enters the Irish sea. The vale of Buttermere, with the lake and village of Crummock Water beyond, next present themselves. we will now follow the main stream, the Cocker, through the fertile and beautiful vale of Lor Ton, till it is lost in the Derwent, below the noble ruins of Cocker Mouth Castle. Lastly, Borrowdale, of which the vale of Keswick is only a continuation, stretching due north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of Windermere, with which we began. From this it will appear that the image of a wheel, thus far exact, is little more than one half complete; but the deficiency on the eas-tern side may be supplied by the vales of Wytheburn, Uls Water, Haws Water, Grasmere, and Rydal: none of these, however, run up to the central point between Great Gavel and Scawfell. From this, hitherto our central point, if we take a flight not more than three or four miles eastward to the ridge of Helvellyn, we shall look down upon Wytheburn and St. John's Vale, a branch of the vale of Keswick. Upon Uls Water, stretching due east, and not far beyond to the south east,( though from this point not visible) lie the vale and Lake of Haws Water, and lastly the vales of Grasmere, Rydal, and Ambleside, bring you back to Windermere; thus completing, though on the eastern side, in a somewhat irregular manner, the represetnative figure of the wheel.\"","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Lakes",50,55],["Wordsworth",61,71],["Langdale",733,741],["Windermere",790,800],["Duddon",1228,1234],["Duddon",1358,1364],["Castle",1574,1580],["Ravenglass",1706,1716],["Wastdale",1796,1804],["Wastdale",2076,2084],["Wast Water",2193,2203],["River Esk",2258,2267],["Ennerdale",2269,2278],["Egremont",2443,2451],["Castle",2474,2480],["Buttermere",2616,2626],["Crummock Water",2657,2671],["Cocker",2745,2751],["Derwent",2827,2834],["Cocker",2861,2867],["Castle",2874,2880],["Borrowdale",2890,2900],["Keswick",2923,2930],["Windermere",3029,3039],["Haws Water",3263,3273],["Grasmere",3275,3283],["Rydal",3289,3294],["Great Gavel",3356,3367],["Scawfell",3372,3380],["Helvellyn",3500,3509],["St. John's Vale",3549,3564],["Keswick",3590,3597],["Haws Water",3736,3746],["Grasmere",3772,3780],["Rydal",3782,3787],["Ambleside",3793,3802],["Windermere",3822,3832]],"geonouns":[["point",233,238],["top",254,257],["mountains",374,383],["summit",433,439],["feet",534,538],["valleys",552,559],["point",602,607],["vale",725,729],["sands",826,831],["vale",938,942],["sea",985,988],["feet",1206,1210],["vale",1220,1224],["winding",1263,1270],["stream",1271,1277],["fields",1284,1290],["rocks",1292,1297],["mountains",1303,1312],["sands",1349,1354],["vale",1377,1381],["stream",1509,1515],["passes",1516,1522],["estuary",1657,1664],["sea",1677,1680],["valley",1786,1792],["chapel",1822,1828],["meadow",1880,1886],["ground",1896,1902],["stone",1921,1926],["walls",1927,1932],["bed",2001,2004],["mountains",2014,2023],["ground",2126,2132],["sea",2163,2166],["stream",2172,2178],["falls",2228,2233],["estuary",2243,2250],["shores",2341,2347],["stream",2353,2359],["passes",2424,2430],["town",2435,2439],["coast",2575,2580],["sea",2599,2602],["vale",2608,2612],["lake",2637,2641],["village",2646,2653],["stream",2733,2739],["vale",2787,2791],["vale",2915,2919],["point",2992,2997],["vale",3021,3025],["vales",3232,3237],["point",3342,3347],["point",3414,3419],["ridge",3491,3496],["vale",3582,3586],["point",3692,3697],["vale",3719,3723],["vales",3763,3768]],"pos_words":[["proper",10,16],["readily",144,151],["like",643,647],["beautifully",1450,1461],["neat",1839,1843],["fertile",1968,1975],["soft",2397,2401],["fertile",2406,2413],["fertile",2765,2772],["beautiful",2777,2786],["noble",2846,2851]],"neg_words":[["cloud",334,339],["lying",696,701],["broken",1101,1107],["lies",1211,1215],["discriminate",1462,1474],["peculiar",1486,1494],["steep",1539,1544],["steep",2008,2013],["lies",2025,2029],["stern",2048,2053],["desolate",2059,2067],["savage",2334,2340],["ruins",2461,2466],["break",2498,2503],["lost",2815,2819],["ruins",2852,2857],["deficiency",3177,3187],["lie",3711,3714],["irregular",3893,3902]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["half a mile",401,412],["three or four miles",3455,3474]],"loc_advs":[["between",3348,3355],["beyond",3648,3654]],"spa_preps":[["between",356,363],["above",468,473],["among",1278,1283],["under",1523,1528],["below",1681,1686],["down",1756,1760],["into",1761,1765],["along",1771,1776],["within",1990,1996],["beyond",2090,2096],["into",2234,2238],["through",2387,2394],["through",2504,2511],["beyond",2672,2678],["through",2753,2760],["below",2836,2841],["opposite",3005,3013],["down",3525,3529]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0208877285,"vader_sentiment":0.47,"roberta_sentiment":0.9967066646},{"para_id":15,"paragraph":"Mr. Wordsworth has remarked,\" that from amenity end beauty, the transition to sublimity is easy and favourable; but the reverse is not so; for after the faculties have been elevated, they are indis-posed to humbler incitement.

In the valleys there is then an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects; as the tender green of the after-grass upon the meadows, interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees, in the irregular enclosures of standing corn, or stubble fields; in the mountain sides, glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm blue lakes, and river pools; and in the foliage of thetrees, through all the tints of autumn. To persons confined to time, the space between the middle or last week in May, and the middle of last week of June, as affording the best combination of long days, fine weather, and the consequent variety of impressions, had been recom-mended. Few or the native trees are then in full leaf; but what-ever may be wanting in depth of shade will be made up in the diversity of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit, and the berry-bearing trees, which abount in the woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs. Still, on those mountains sides that have a northern aspect, many of the spring flowers are back-ward, whilst the open and sunny places are stocked with those of summer. Here the linnet and thrush chant their love-songs, safe from the birds of prey that build in the inaccessible crags, and are frequently heard or scen wheeling about in the air. In the narrow valleys here, it is remarked, there are no sky-larks, as their destroy-ers would be able to dart upon them from the nearest heights. The nightingale seldom resorts here, but almost all the other tribes of the English warblers are numerous. Several other circumstances render the close of spring particularly interesting, as the bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the valleys and enclo-sed grounds. At this time, too, the traveller. will be sure of room, and comfortable accommodation, even in the small Inns. As to the order in which objects are best seen, it is observed, a lake will ap-pear to most advantage when approached from its outlet, especially if it be in a mountainous country. By this way of approach the spectator faces the grander features of the scene, and is gradually conducted into its most sublime recesses As to the precipitous sides of the mountains, and the neighbouring summits, they may be seen with effect under any atmosphere which allows of their being seen at all. The visitant to the mountains should reach the summit by sun-rise, or remain there till the time of sunset. A stranger to a mountainous country should take his early morning walk on the eastern side of the vale, otherwise he will lose the morning light, first touching the tops, and thence creeping down the sides of the opposite hills, as the sun ascends. If the line of the horizon in the east be low, the western side may be taken for the sake of the reflections upon the water: in the evening, for like reasons, the countrary course should be adopted.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["valleys",196,203],["meadows",367,374],["islands",394,401],["rock",419,423],["trees",447,452],["fields",511,517],["mountain",526,534],["lakes",596,601],["river",607,612],["trees",947,952],["trees",1120,1125],["woods",1147,1152],["mountains",1227,1236],["crags",1491,1496],["valleys",1572,1579],["mountains",1932,1941],["valleys",1957,1964],["grounds",1979,1986],["lake",2165,2169],["outlet",2226,2232],["country",2271,2278],["mountains",2452,2461],["summits",2484,2491],["mountains",2604,2613],["summit",2631,2637],["country",2720,2727],["vale",2790,2794],["hills",2914,2919],["line",2948,2952],["horizon",2960,2967],["water",3059,3064]],"pos_words":[["best",7,11],["recommended",62,73],["admirable",221,230],["harmony",265,272],["tender",326,332],["glowing",542,549],["calm",586,590],["best",818,822],["fine",849,853],["variety",882,889],["golden",1165,1171],["love",1420,1424],["safe",1432,1436],["interesting",1880,1891],["comfortable",2048,2059],["best",2136,2140],["advantage",2191,2200],["sublime",2400,2407],["tops",2857,2861],["like",3086,3090]],"neg_words":[["irregular",461,470],["confined",696,704],["destroy",1635,1642],["precipitous",2427,2438],["stranger",2694,2702],["lose",2814,2818],["creeping",2874,2882]],"events":[],"dates":[["the

The plain is then seemingly immense in extent, continued on in a dead level, and uniform in appearance. As he pursues his often trackless way, he will recollect, that probably, but a few hours before, the whole expanse was co-vered with some fathoms of water, and that in a few more, it will as certainly be covered again. At the same time he may also perceive on his left hand, the retreated Ocean ready to obey the mysterious laws of its irresistible movement, without any visible barrier to stay it a moment where it is. These considera-tions, though they may not be sufficient to alarm, must yet be able to rouse the mind to a style of more than ordinary attention. But when the traveller reaches the side of the Eau, whose affections will be greatly increased: he there drops down a gentle descent to the edge of a broad and seemingly im-passable river, where the only remains he can per-ceive of the surrounding lands, are the tops of dis-tant mountains.

The original rules of St. Bernard partook, in several instances, of the austerities of those of La Trappe, and the society did not very readily relin-quish the milder laws of St. Benedict, for the new rigours imposed upon them by the parent monas-tery of Savigny. They were forbidden to taste flesh, except when ill, and even eggs, butter, cheese, and milk, but on extraordinary occasions; and denied even the use of linen and fur. The monks were di-vided into two classes, to which separate departments belonged. Those who attended the choir slept upon straw, in their usual habits, from which at midnight they rose and passed into the church, where they continued their hymns during the short remainder of the night. After this first mass, having publicly confessed themselves, they retired to their cells, and the day was employed in spiritual exercises, and in copying or illuminating manuscripts. An unbroken silence was observed, except when after dinner they withdrew in the Locutorium, where for an hour they were permitted the common privileges of social beings. This class was confiend to the boundary wall, except that on some particular days the mem-bers of it were allowed to walk in parties beyond it, for exercise and amusement; but they were seldom permitted either to receive to pay visits. Like the monks of La Trappe, however, they were distin-guished for extensive charities, probably consisting of such meat, offal,&amp; c. which they could not otherwise dispose of; hence poor travellers were so scru-polously entertained at the abbey, that it was not till the dissolution that an inn was thought necessary in this part of Furness, when one was opened for the accommodation of people of buisness, of which there were few or none before.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Savigny",110,117],["Normandy",122,130],["Savigny",617,624],["Furness",2007,2014]],"geonouns":[["abbey",24,29],["church",999,1005],["common",1398,1404],["wall",1474,1478],["abbey",1913,1918],["inn",1965,1968]],"pos_words":[["magnificent",12,23],["dedicated",34,43],["readily",498,505],["extraordinary",727,740],["spiritual",1199,1208],["illuminating",1238,1250]],"neg_words":[["severe",237,243],["dissolution",318,329],["forbidden",636,645],["denied",756,762],["poor",1856,1860],["dissolution",1945,1956]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",1175,1182],["some particular days",1495,1515]],"times":[["midnight",960,968],["the night",1070,1079],["an hour",1366,1373]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",1567,1573],["there",2090,2095]],"spa_preps":[["into",818,822],["into",990,994]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9856091142},{"para_id":64,"paragraph":"\" This was the second house in England that receiv-ed the Bernardine rules, the most rigorous of which, however, were dispensed with in 1485 by Sixtus Iv, when among other indulgences, the whole order was allowed to taste meat on three days of the week.

I enquired the name of this moun-tain from a boy trundling a hoop, and from a woman who had, probably, lived all herlife within sight of it, but neither could give me the desired information. This reminded me of a circumstance somewhat similar that occurred to a friend of mine, when travelling in this part of the country.

She replied, in angry tone, that\" she knew nothing about it, she had something else to do than go maundering about enquiring the names of hills.\" - The road from Lowick passes over Kirkby fell, on which there are some slate quarries. I went into one close by the road side, in which there were about a dozen men at work. An old man was employed on the almost perpendicular side of the rock, fifteen or twenty yards from the bottom. He had only a very narrow space to stand upon, and what apparently increased his danger, was his hav-ing on his feet, what they call in this country clogs, which are shoes with wooden soles, shod with iron. He was working with an iron crow. The least ac-cident might cause him to lose his centre of gravity, and then nothing could save him from instant de-struction, but laying hold of a rope which hung near him, suspended from above. He said he had worked in the quarry more than thirty years. When within about three or four miles of Broughton, came within sight of the mountain Black Comb, rising dark and majestic on the other side of the vale of Duddon. I staid all night at the Old King's Head, where I had good accommodation at a maderate charge. An intelligent young man, Mr. G-- the son of a respectable inhabitant of the place, whom I met with at the Inn, though I was quite a stranger to him, offered to accompany me next morning to a Druidical antiquity in the neighbour-hood. It would seem that Broughton is in a healthy situation, for walking out in the morning before breakfast in the church-yard, the first tomb-stone I met with was in memory of a family remarkable for longevity. It mentioned Mr. Watters, of Broughton, surgeon, who died in 1767, aged 78, and of Anne, his wife, in 1791, aged 104 years. Also, Thomas Wat Ters, aged 101, his wife Mary, 94.

After rather a steep ascent along a rough wooded road, we arrived at the first level of a mountain, and from a hill had a prospect which well rewarded us, though disappointe - ed in seeing\" Sunken Church,\" excepting at a dis-tance. We could perceive it in the middle of a field, about half a mile west of us; but a deep ravine, through which flowed a bridgeless flood, swollen by the late rains, prevented our nearer ap-proach. The summit of the mountain beyond was involved in clouds. But turning to the west, we had a grand view-the town of Broughton below us, lying snugly under a grove of firs-farther south, the estuary of Duddon, filled with the tide, shew-ed a large lake; with two or three small vessels sailing upon it; - on the other side were seen Kir By fell, and the fertile tract of Low Furness And beyond a promontory, the Isle of Walney, with Peel Castle on its extreme southern point. I am told that the prospect from the summit of Black Comb, when the weather is favourable, is one of the finest and most extensive in the north of En Gland. We descended the mountain obliquely to the left. Mr. G. pointed out to me a house, which goes by the name of Thimble Hall. One might wonder from its bleak and elevated situation, what could have induced any mortal to build it. As its name imports, it was erected by a tailor, who hav-ing emigrated to London, and thriven in business, retained so much love for his native place,( though so unattractive in all other eyes,) as to come here and soend the evening of his days. He is yet well remembered in Broughton; and many times his boon companions from thence made Thimble Hall resound with their merriment. There is a tale told of him. That when in business he had a good round sum owing to him by a few young collegians, at Ox Ford. Being somewhat importunate in his demand for money, they were induced to play him a prank. One of his creditors had agreed to give him an entertainment, and that if he would be kind enough to come down to Oxford they would be glad to see him, and the money should at all events be provided. The Knight of the Thim Ble accordingly posted down. There was no money for him, as may be guessed, bt he was so well plied with intoxicating liquors, as to be deprived of all sense and motion-put into a hamper, with a direc-tion, and sent by the coach to his own house in London. When he came to himself he was so ashamed of the circumstance, that he never troubled them afterwards. But it should be mentioned to the honour of one of these wags, that having succeeded to a handsome property, he remitted the tailor the amount of his debt, with the interest till the day it was paid.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Black Comb",74,84],["The Duddon",134,144],["Broughton",880,889],["Duddon",965,971],["Furness",1138,1145],["Isle",1175,1179],["Walney",1183,1189],["Peel",1196,1200],["Castle",1201,1207],["Black Comb",1286,1296],["London",1697,1703],["Broughton",1898,1907],["Ford",2125,2129],["Oxford",2336,2342],["London",2694,2700]],"geonouns":[["stream",160,166],["bridge",180,186],["road",312,316],["mountain",327,335],["road",386,390],["mountain",427,435],["hill",448,452],["field",609,614],["summit",769,775],["mountain",783,791],["town",872,876],["grove",921,926],["estuary",954,961],["lake",1011,1015],["promontory",1159,1169],["point",1232,1237],["summit",1276,1282],["mountain",1413,1421],["house",1472,1477],["coach",2668,2673],["house",2685,2690]],"pos_words":[["well",474,478],["grand",857,862],["fertile",1117,1124],["finest",1344,1350],["wonder",1529,1535],["love",1747,1751],["well",1879,1883],["resound",1974,1981],["merriment",1993,2002],["good",2064,2068],["enough",2313,2319],["glad",2357,2361],["well",2534,2538],["succeeded",2880,2889],["handsome",2895,2903]],"neg_words":[["steep",352,357],["rough",373,378],["swollen",706,713],["lying",900,905],["fell",1103,1107],["bleak",1545,1550],["unattractive",1785,1797],["importunate",2146,2157],["deprived",2581,2589],["hamper",2625,2631],["ashamed",2736,2743],["troubled",2779,2787],["debt",2955,2959]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",153,159],["his days",1859,1867],["the day",2984,2991]],"times":[["the evening",1844,1855]],"distances":[["about half a mile",616,633]],"loc_advs":[["past",8,12],["here",148,152],["beyond",792,798],["left",1439,1443],["here",1829,1833]],"spa_preps":[["out",25,28],["along",365,370],["through",665,672],["below",890,895],["under",913,918],["beyond",1150,1156],["out",1460,1463],["round",2069,2074],["down",2328,2332],["down",2468,2472],["into",2618,2622]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0072727273,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969280362},{"para_id":103,"paragraph":"We passed Duddon Grove the seat of Richard Towers, Esq, pleasantly situated among woods.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Duddon Grove",10,22]],"geonouns":[["seat",27,31],["woods",82,87]],"pos_words":[["pleasantly",56,66]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["among",76,81]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0909090909,"vader_sentiment":0.48,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987886548},{"para_id":104,"paragraph":"A new road has been made from the Grove up the Cumberland side of the river.

This road goes to the brink of a precipice on the left, rising above the Glenderaterra, a short dis-tance from the bridge. Here are two steep descents to the river, - the first so rugged and narrow, as to be somewhat dangerous: the best way is by Brund Holm, an ancient farm-house on the bridge to Derwent Fold, and through the fields to High End, west of a line of farms leading to Threlkeld.

To describe this view is difficult, as no expression can convey an idea of the subject, where the wild variety consists only of various features of the same objects; rocks and mountains forming and constituting the parts of this massive theatre. In the front of this romantic scene, a small mount presents itself, covered with herbage: small from the mighty stature and gigan-tic members of the other parts of the prospect. Overlooking this mount stands a round rock, push-ing his mountainous brow into the clouds, once crowned with a castle. On the summit of the mount, sweetly contrasted by the grey rocks behind, there grows, with peculiar picturesque beauties, a single ancient oak. The lake beneath was a perfect mir-ror. On each hand the cliffs and mountains are strewed with bushes and shrubs, down whose sides small streams of water trill, like so many threads of silver, giving a delicate mixture to the greyness of the rocks over which they pass, in many places per-pendicular, and rent into a thousand rude columns, as if they had been torn by thunderbolts; in other places they are of a tamer aspect, and, compacted in one solid mass, stand firm as the pillows of the antediluvian world. Where the hills are separated, little vales filled with wood, or narrow winding dells of grass-ground, twist around their feet, and give a happy variegation to the view. In some places, clefts in the rocks afford a prospect into a valley be-hind; in others, the over-hanging cliffs form rude arches and apertures, through which distant moun-tains are discovered. Behind all are mountains piled on mountains, where the clouds roll in hea-vy volumes, giving a gloominess to those regionsof confusion and barrenness, which rendered the lus-tre of the shining lake, and the streams of light which fell upon the rocks, waterfalls, and shrubs, brighter and more pleasing. In the cliffs in this part of the lake eagles build their nests, far removed from gunshot, and seldom disturbed by man; for it is no easy matter to assail their lofty habitation.

Formerly the only hman vestige that presented itself in this dreary chasm, was the solitary track of the dalesman. The road is now sufficiently perspicuous; though from the savage asperities of the scenery, it could still be no matter of surprise, if a susceptible stranger should feel somewhat awed, or even intimidated, in his progress. A second beautifully wooded eminence rises behind Castle Crag; and the Derwent rolls its rapid channel at the foot of it. The water of this beautiful river has no tinge of the mountain impurities: the vari-co-loured stones and granite, of which its bed is com-posed, glitter in the pellucid stream like the phases of a prism. From many of these tremendous cliffs the fragments have been flung in awful profusion, and from the danger of an instance succession no part of the dale appears secure. Large and pon-derous masses of rock are seen arrested in the va-rious stages of their fall; some of them have become fixed, and given birth to moss and trees; and others remain in a state yet menacing the safety of the traveller. As we advanced, sometimes crossing and at others shoring the river, we noticed on our left the famous Eagle Crag. The devastation formerly committed by these predatory invaders is said to have amounted to the sum of one lamb a day; but the hazard of the enterprise bears no present proportion to the value of the reward. A gill in the Eagle Cliff communicates on the postern side, by a precipitous pass of five miles, with the Vale of Lang Dale, the character of which is not yielding to that of Borrowdale, in its assemblage of the sublime and terrific. This, however, was insufficient to daunt the intrepidity of the notorious Hatfield, who escaped his pursuers by this route, after the detection of his imposture by Judge Hardinge at Keswick. On the right we saw a mine of blacklead in full work; and here and there a knoll, crowned with a sparing tuft of lively verdure; a contrast powerfully impressive in scenes where barbarism and desolation only are in consistency, and indeed where civilization seems to have made so little progress, that a person long used to the security and comforts of social life, is led involuntarily to form associations of the most painful kind. Reached Si Torr, a little miserable village, whence we clambered a rugged steep bounded by a gulf, in which a cataract is dashed from rock to rock, with a wildness and impetuosity well suited to the horrors of the surrounding scene. From the sum-mit we commanded a noble retrospect of mountain overtopping mountain, as if aspiring to lift its rugged brow beyond that of its towering neighbours.

At the head of Honister, an enormous crag, froming part of the left boundary, is a slate quarry; and the traveller's hallo, vibrating through a long and varied cadence, is no sooner heard by the miners, than the cheering response is conveyed him by the shrill but faint echoes of a horn they keep for the purpose; nor is this any contemptible gratification to the weary victim of solitude and despondence, where not sound but the reverberation of the torrent's roar\" visits his sad ear.\"","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Castle Crag",493,504],["Derwent",514,521],["Eagle Crag",1270,1280],["Borrowdale",1664,1674],["Keswick",1905,1912],["Gatesgarth",2810,2820],["Honister",3270,3278]],"geonouns":[["track",196,201],["road",223,227],["channel",538,545],["foot",553,557],["water",569,574],["river",593,598],["mountain",619,627],["stones",659,665],["bed",692,695],["stream",734,740],["dale",917,921],["rock",969,973],["trees",1090,1095],["river",1229,1234],["gill",1491,1495],["pass",1566,1570],["village",2384,2391],["cataract",2458,2466],["rock",2482,2486],["rock",2490,2494],["mountain",2633,2641],["mountain",2654,2662],["brow",2698,2702],["village",2799,2806],["point",2834,2839],["country",2982,2989],["walls",3126,3131],["region",3199,3205],["head",3262,3266],["crag",3292,3296],["quarry",3344,3350]],"pos_words":[["sufficiently",235,247],["awed",399,403],["progress",433,441],["beautifully",452,463],["eminence",471,479],["rapid",532,537],["beautiful",583,592],["glitter",710,717],["like",741,745],["profusion",845,854],["secure",930,936],["advanced",1174,1182],["famous",1263,1269],["reward",1481,1487],["sublime",1701,1708],["terrific",1713,1721],["right",1921,1926],["work",1962,1966],["lively",2027,2033],["powerfully",2054,2064],["impressive",2065,2075],["progress",2201,2209],["led",2283,2286],["well",2528,2532],["noble",2613,2618],["impressed",2868,2877],["soft",3025,3029],["formidable",3151,3161],["well",3212,3216],["progress",3245,3253],["gratification",3598,3611]],"neg_words":[["chaotic",70,77],["dreary",165,171],["savage",277,283],["susceptible",357,368],["stranger",369,377],["awful",839,844],["danger",869,875],["fall",1024,1028],["menacing",1130,1138],["devastation",1286,1297],["predatory",1326,1335],["hazard",1408,1414],["precipitous",1554,1565],["insufficient",1742,1754],["daunt",1758,1763],["notorious",1787,1796],["desolation",2106,2116],["involuntarily",2287,2300],["painful",2334,2341],["miserable",2374,2383],["steep",2422,2427],["treacherous",2766,2777],["savage",2887,2893],["desert",3082,3088],["extinguish",3222,3232],["vibrating",3379,3388],["shrill",3508,3514],["faint",3519,3524],["contemptible",3585,3597],["weary",3619,3624],["despondence",3648,3659],["torrent",3706,3713],["sad",3733,3736]],"events":[],"dates":[["a day",1393,1398]],"times":[],"distances":[["five miles",1574,1584]],"loc_advs":[["left",1254,1258],["here",1972,1976],["there",1981,1986],["beyond",2703,2709],["nigh",3217,3221],["left",3318,3322]],"spa_preps":[["behind",486,492],["through",3389,3396]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0060240964,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9978781939},{"para_id":216,"paragraph":"Nearly opposite to Castle Crag, in one of the re-cesses of this romantic chasm, is that gigantic mass of rock, called the Bowder Stone.

To add to these deformities, a crazy ladder has been erected against the Bowder Stone to enable persons to see imperfectly from its top what they can behold to much better advantage from the summit of Castle Crag, nearly opposite, and only divided by the River Derwent. The Bowder Stone lies at the southern extremity of Derwent Water, not far distant from Grange, if it is visited, as it sometims is, in an excursion round Derwent Water, it length-ens the ride two miles; it is not above a mile distant from Castle Crag.

A circumstance of peculiar consolation to the traveller here distinguishes this from other mountainous tracts, where the hills are divided by bogs and mosses, and often difficult to pass, which is, that the mosses are on the tops of the mountains, and a way over, or around them, is never difficult to find. The in-habitants of the dale are served with turf fuel from these mosses, and the manner of procuring it is very singular. A man carries on his back, a sledge to the top of the mountain, and conducts it down the most awful descents, by placing himself before it to pre-vent its running aside. For this purpose, a narrow furrow is cut in the mountain's side, which seres for a road to direct the sledge, and to pitch the conduct-ors heel in.

From some of the fields near Dalemain, Dacre Castle, backed by the jagged summit of Sad Dleback, with the valley and stream in front, may be seen to advantage. A glen or valley, worthy notice, leads up to Airey Force and thence to Martindale, a wild and interesting spot. In Gowbarrow Park, the lover of Nature might linger for hours: here is a brook that dashes amongst rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy in-termixture of native wood; here are beds of luxu-riant fern, aged hawthorns, and hollies, decked with honey-suckles; and fallow deer glancing and bound-ing over the lawns and through the thickets. These constitute a fore-ground for ever-varying pictures of the majestic lake, forced to take a winding course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of sublime form, towering above each other. At the outlet of Gowbarrow Park there is another stream flowing through a little recess, called Glencoin, with a single house, visible from the road. Having passed under the steeps of Styebarrow Crag, and the re-mains of its woods at Glenridding Bridge, a fourth stream is crossed. The opening of this on the side of Ulswater Vale is adorned with fertile fields, cot-tages, and natural groves; and if followed beyond the enclosures, will lead along bold water-breaks and water-falls to a silent tarn in the recesses of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly the haunt of eagles, that built in the precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel round the head of the solitary angler. At the head of the lake, being now in Patterdale, seven miles and a half from Ambleside, Grisdale Beck, a fifth stream from Keswick, is crossed; hence you may pass through a woody steep, up to the level area of the valley of Grisdale, where there are some hollies uncommonly large; hence their is a path for foot travellers to Grasmere, along which a horse may be led, if necessary. Whilst ascending this valley, a sublime com-bination of mountain forms appear in front, and increase till the path leads almost immediately under the masses of Helvellyn. The road up the main dale, the next considerable stream, would conduct us to Deep dale, which is terminated by a cove, a creggy and gloomy abyss, with steep sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it by the west wind from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having proceeded along the western side of Brother's Water, a stream soon after issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This is a spot seldom explored by travellers. But whoever looks back from these sylvan and rocky recesses on the gleam-ing surface of Brother's Water, or forward to the steep sides and lofty ridges of Dove Crag, will be equally pleased with the beauty, grandeur, and wildness of the country. Seven glens or valleys branch off from the Cumberland side of the vale. The op-posite side has only two streams of any importance, one of which crosses the Kerkstone road, near the foot of Brother's Water; this road leads to the decaying hamlet of Hartsop, remarkable for its cottage architecture. The other coming down Martindale enters Ulswater at Sandwyke, opposite Gowbarrow Park. From Blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of Place Fell, richly aodrned with juni-per, and sprinkled over with birches, to the village of Sandwyke, Martindale is not rich, but interesting from its seclusion. The general want of wood in these vales give a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages embowered in sycamores, and few of the mountain chapels are more striking than this of Martindale. The name of Boardale, a deep, bare, and houseless valley, which communicaties with Martin Dale, shews that the wild swine were once numerous in that nook. In Martindale, the road loses sight of the lake and leads over a steep hill, bringing us again in sight of Ulswater, or, rather, of its lowest reach, four miles in length; and the new road is ter-minated by the long ridge of Cross Fell in the dis-tance. Immediately under the eye is a deep indented hay, rendered cheerful by two ro three substantial houses, more ornamented and shewy than usual in these wild spots.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Dalemain",3,11],["Penrith,",36,44],["Dacor",67,72],["Ulswater",105,113],["Eamont",129,135],["Penruddock",178,188],["Hutton John",225,236],["Dacre

or Patrick's - dale, takes its name from the baptism of that saint, purported to have been performed at a fount still preserved by the road-side. It is a poor little village, in which, however, if there is but little to admire, there is nothing to offend the eye or the imagination. Its fine pastoral valley is watered by the River Coldrill, which conributes to replenish the lake. Nothing can exceed the verdure of its inclosures, which are exposed to fre-quent inundations, and have been known to lie half the season under water. The fine conical hill called Hartsop Dod, is seen from the western shore, thrust-ing forward its sharp bold breast, and shutting the vale. The lake is nine miles long, about three quarters of a mile across, and seventy yards deep. It is well stocked with trout and char, and is exclusively famous for a fish called scaleys, or skellies, which somewhat resemble herrings, and herd in shoals. An old fisherman of the dale once netted 12,000 of these at a draught. The water possesses little trans-parency, and is indeed often turbid. Two small in-sular specks appear upon its surface. On the banks of Windermere we had admired the beautiful and picturesque; the Lake of Derwent had astonished us with the profusion of the sublime and wild; but the sober serenity of Ulswater inspired us with the more elevated notions of romantic grandeur. On the right of the road, at the entrance of the village, a finely furnished glen intersects from miles the roots of the mountains. It is overhung by the prominent summits of Glenridding Dod, Black Crag, and the Griesdale Fells; a long and beautiful chain.

The circumstance was too singular to be left by people curious in their observations on natural events. We desired our guide would take care of himself, and leave us to our pleasure; but the good attendant had a due sense of our impro-priety in wishing to be left there, and determined to abide by us. The clouds advanced with acce-lerated speed; a hollow blast sounded amongst the hills and dells which lay below, and seemed to fly from the approaching darkness: the vapour rolled down the opposite valley of Newland, and appeared to tumble in mighty sheets and volumes from the brow of each mountain into the vale of Keswick and over the lakes. Whilst we admired this phenomenon, the clouds below us gradually ascended, and we soon found the summit of Skiddaw totally surrounded, whilst we on every side looked down upon an angry and impetuous sea, heaving its billows. We were rejoicing in this grand spectacle of nature, and thinking ourselves fortunate in having beheld so extraordinary an event, when, to our astonishment and confusion, a violent burst of thunder, engen-dered in the vapour below, stunned our sense, being repeated from every rock, and down every dell, in horrid uproar; at the same time, from the agitation of the air, the mountain seemed to tremble at the explosion, the clouds were instantaneously illuminat-ed, and from innumerable chasms sent forth streams of lightning. Our guide lay upon the earth terrified and amazed, in his ejaculations accusing us of pre-sumption and impiety. Danger made us solemn; we had no where to fly for safety, no place to cover our heads; to descend, was to rush into the inflam-mable vapour from whence our perils proceeded, to stay was equally hazardous; for now the clouds, which had received such a concussion from the thunder, ascended higher and higher, enveloping the whole mountain, and letting fall a heavy shower of rain. We thought ourselves happy even under this circumstance, to perceive the storm turning north-west, and to hear the next clap burst in the plain beyond Bassenthwaite Water. A like event has frequently happened to travellers in the heights of the Alps, from whence the thunder storms are seen passing over the countries beneath them. The echoes from the mountains which bordered Keswick Lake, from Newland, Borrowdale, and Lowdore, were noble, and gave a repetition of the thunder-claps distinctly, though distant, after an intermission of several seconds of tremendous silence! The rain, which still increased, formed innumerable streams and cascades, which rushed from the crown f Skid Daw, Saddleback, and Cawsey Pike, with a mighty nose; but we were deprived of the beauty of these waterfalls by the intercepting vapour, which was not to be penetrated by the eye more than a few yards before us.

The people of St. John's Dale are great mart-hunters: the animal, which is not swift, soon flies to its warren for refuge, where it is suffo - cated with the fumes of lighted straw. There is a breed perfectly inodorous, and comparatively little destructive; this is called the Sweet Mart. In this neighbourhood there have been abundance of foxes and wild cats, for the production of every head of which the peasantry received a pecuniary compensation.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",8,15],["Ulswater",20,28],["Matterdale",32,42],["St. John's",647,657]],"geonouns":[["ridge",60,65],["hill",69,73],["head",1022,1026]],"pos_words":[["powerfully",470,480],["great",667,672],["swift",712,717],["perfectly",832,841],["abundance",960,969]],"neg_words":[["intolerable",430,441],["noxious",446,453],["fumes",791,796],["destructive",878,889],["wild",983,987]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",944,949]],"spa_preps":[["beneath",357,364],["away",603,607]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.77,"roberta_sentiment":0.9958094358},{"para_id":275,"paragraph":"Excursion Xi.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977480769},{"para_id":276,"paragraph":"From Keswick to Buttermere, through Barrowdale.

Descending the track on the left, we behold a most singular contrast: viz. four spiral towering heights, dark, dun, and gloomy at noon day, rising immedi-ately from the western extremity of the deep narrow dell, and hanging over Buttermere. The more sou-thern is called by the dalesmen, Hayrick, from its form, the most pointed one, High Crag; the third, Highstile, and the fourth, from the iron colour, Red Pike. Between the second and third there is a large crater, that appears to have been the focus of a volcano at some distant period of time, when the cones were produced by explosion. At present, it is the reservoir of water that feeds the roaring cata-ract seen in the descent to Buttermere. Here all is barrenness, solitude, and silence, only interrupted by the murmurs of a rill, running unseen in the narrow bottom of a deep dell. The smooth verdant sides of the vast hills on the right are furrowed by the win-ter rains. Some traces of industry, however, soon obtrude themselves at the foot of the glen, and point out our return to society, for we now approach the village of Buttermere, situated betwixt the lakes. The life of the inhabitants here before the lake were so much frequented, was purely rustic; the women spun woollen yarn, and some of the men were em-ployed in the slate quarries. Above the village we have the view of the upper lake, two miles in length, and short of one in breath, and terminated on the western side by Red Pike.

A bright stream which pours along a rocky channel, ornaments this vale, and sparkles down in numerous little cascades. its banks are adorned with wood, and varied by different ob-jects; a bridge, a mill, a hamlet; a glade overhung with wood, or some little sweet recess, or natural vista. The vale is about two miles and a half to length.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Wast Water",41,51],["Buttermere",110,120],["Crummock Water",125,139],["Lorton",187,193],["Scale Hill",334,344],["River Cocker",555,567],["Grasmere",588,596],["Crummock Water",628,642],["Lorton",734,740]],"geonouns":[["vale",179,183],["summit",353,359],["landscape",469,478],["head",582,586],["point",684,689],["mountains",926,935],["stream",1069,1075],["channel",1102,1109],["vale",1126,1130],["banks",1183,1188],["wood",1206,1210],["bridge",1248,1254],["hamlet",1266,1272],["wood",1296,1300],["vale",1353,1357]],"pos_words":[["convenient",222,232],["commodious",316,326],["rich",428,432],["immense",482,489],["right",658,663],["advantageous",671,683],["majestic",822,830],["lovely",855,861],["smile",862,867],["enough",976,982],["bright",1062,1068],["sweet",1317,1322]],"neg_words":[["decline",24,31],["frown",831,836],["impending",1027,1036],["rocky",1096,1101]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["about half a mile",382,399],["about a mile",939,951],["about two miles and a half",1361,1387]],"loc_advs":[["here",742,746],["between",918,925],["near",971,975]],"spa_preps":[["over",577,581],["aside",812,817],["along",1088,1093],["down",1145,1149]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0575539568,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.996085763},{"para_id":323,"paragraph":"Excursion Xii.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961531758},{"para_id":324,"paragraph":"From Ambleside.

The upper end is fine, with bold, steep, craggy rocks and mountains; a noble ridge of these run along the southside of this lake, very bold and prominent, down to the water's edge. This lake has been seldom vi-sited by travellers, though it is distinguished by the solemn grandeur of its rock and scenery.

After passing over a few fields behind the village ale-house, we arrived at a huge barrier of rocks, which rises to the height of twenty yards. To the right is a similar natural fortification. The intermediate space is of course a deep chasm. Proceeding up this chasm, the rocks increase in loftiness; but are on the left irregular and less perpendicular. There was on the left a singular accumulation of stones, forming a striking resemblance of a cross. Though very accurate, it was without a doubt a natural production. But we were deprived of the sight of this curiosity; for some the country Vandals have lately reduced it into a heap of rubbish -\" Strange,\" said my friend,\" that there should be found one being who can thus wantonly devastate the' frolic scenes' of Nature, and suppress that stream of pleasure which flows from the purest fountain of the human heart-stranger still that no punishment should await him!\" - After cautiously advancing for a considerable dis-tance we reached the extremity of the glen.

Behind the cascade is a large excavation. In it we stood, and eyed the firmament through the liquid element. We retired, casting an occasional glance at the overhanging steeps, which seemed to threaten us with destruction. And we could scarce-ly assure ourselves that the danger was imaginary, when we were clambering over the vast masses, which have at some period fallen from the adjoining ciffs, and now obstruct the pathway.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Hawes",61,66]],"geonouns":[["road",105,109],["hamlet",177,183],["fields",210,216],["village",228,235],["house",240,245],["rocks",279,284],["rocks",458,463],["stones",590,596],["country",774,781],["stream",984,990],["glen",1202,1206],["water",1246,1251],["falls",1252,1257],["summit",1289,1295],["rocks",1303,1308],["water",1433,1438],["stream",1579,1585],["water",1741,1746],["rocks",1839,1844]],"pos_words":[["right",336,341],["striking",608,616],["accurate",653,661],["frolic",940,946],["pleasure",994,1002],["great",1232,1237],["sensation",1352,1361],["finely",1754,1760],["hardy",1781,1786],["assure",2184,2190]],"neg_words":[["irregular",507,516],["doubt",680,685],["deprived",720,728],["rubbish",828,835],["devastate",925,934],["suppress",970,978],["stranger",1059,1067],["falling",1425,1432],["desert",1559,1565],["weary",1711,1716],["dark",1883,1887],["dismal",1892,1898],["threaten",2131,2139],["destruction",2148,2159],["scarce",2174,2180],["danger",2210,2216],["imaginary",2221,2230],["fallen",2304,2310],["obstruct",2345,2353]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",49,52]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",56,60],["left",502,506],["left",558,562],["without",670,677],["there",871,876]],"spa_preps":[["into",44,48],["over",199,203],["behind",217,223],["into",813,817],["into",1309,1313],["below",1332,1337],["about",1521,1526],["into",1630,1634],["above",1662,1667],["out",1811,1814],["over",1874,1878],["through",2019,2026],["over",2256,2260]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.045,"vader_sentiment":-0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9842516184},{"para_id":388,"paragraph":"Returning, we bade adieu to Hawes, which is re-markable for nothing but the politeness, intelli-gence, and hospitality of its inhabitants.","file_id":"1827_a","plnames":[["Hawes",28,33]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["politeness",76,86]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.1,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981932044},{"para_id":389,"paragraph":"We descended the vale to Askrigg, - The scenery thither is marked with tameness.
