It was owing to the strong inclination, by which he was prompted to express the pleasure he had received, in a visit paid to his native country after a long absence, from the view of several uncommon, grand, or beautiful scenes of nature and of art, which he here attempts to describe. This pleasure was undoubtedly much benighted by an advantagious comparison of its present state with That, in which he had left it. When we behold rich improvements of a wild and uncultivated soil, in their state of maturity, without having observed their rise and progress, we are struck with wonder and astonishment, to see the face of Nature totally changed. It carries an air of enchantment and romance: and the fabulous and luxuriant description, given is by the Poet, of yellow harvests rising up instantaneously under the wheels of the chariot of Ceres, as it passed over the barren deserts, hardly seems, in the midst of our surprise, too extravagant an image to represent the greatness and seeming suddenness of such a change:","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["country",350,357]],"pos_words":[["strong",234,240],["pleasure",294,302],["grand",415,420],["beautiful",425,434],["pleasure",505,513],["rich",647,651],["improvements",652,664],["maturity",716,724],["progress",765,773],["wonder",794,800],["astonishment",805,817],["fabulous",916,924],["luxuriant",929,938],["greatness",1185,1194]],"neg_words":[["absence",371,378],["wild",670,674],["struck",782,788],["barren",1083,1089],["extravagant",1147,1158]],"events":[],"dates":[["almost two years ago",31,51]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",473,477],["left",623,627],["without",726,733]],"spa_preps":[["under",1019,1024],["over",1074,1078]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0909090909,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980700612},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"cano rota pulvere labens Sulcatam faecundat humum; flavescit aristis Orbita; surgentes condunt vestigia culmi Versit iter comitata seges.","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[["Orbita",69,75]],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9939536452},{"para_id":5,"paragraph":"Claudian","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9864436388},{"para_id":6,"paragraph":"But how great and rational soever the pleasure of such a sight may be, it is still surpassed by that arising from the extraordinary increase of a trading Town, and the new plantations of Houses and Men.

The Mines near that place are remarkable for so many singular circumstances, that they are generally esteemed to be well worth the observation of travellers. But the uncommonness of the occasion, on which this description was addressed by two very amiable Persons, afforded him the means of still heightening the novelty of his subject, and of throwing it into a more agreeable and poetic light by an early introduction of classical allusion and parody. It also gave him( what he valued most) a natural opportunity of expressing his just esteem for a truly respectable family, with whose merit he had long had the happiness of being well acquainted, whose Interest appears to be inseparably connected with That of his native country, and to which It already owed the most considerable advantages.","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[["Whitehaven",290,300]],"geonouns":[["town",270,274],["country",1080,1087]],"pos_words":[["great",8,13],["rational",18,26],["pleasure",38,46],["extraordinary",118,131],["remarkable",385,395],["well",471,475],["worth",476,481],["amiable",603,610],["novelty",668,675],["agreeable",723,732],["poetic",737,743],["respectable",912,923],["merit",943,948],["happiness",969,978],["well",988,992],["advantages",1140,1150]],"neg_words":[["absence",311,318],["parody",801,807]],"events":[],"dates":[["less than thirty years",331,353]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["near",365,369],["into",711,715]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1538461538,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9982985854},{"para_id":7,"paragraph":"Allusion and parody&amp; c.] To save the reader the trouble of turning to books, several of the passages alluded to in the description of the mines are here inserted:","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["trouble",52,59]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",152,156]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0666666667,"vader_sentiment":0.13,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9917073846},{"para_id":8,"paragraph":"quae te fortuna fatigat, Ut tristes sine sole domos, loca turbida, adires?","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9976629019},{"para_id":9,"paragraph":"Virg.

He has endeavoured to describe, in a poetic manner, the effects of the elastic steam and the great power of the atmosphere; which by their alternate actions, give force and motion to the beam of this engine, and by it, to the pump rods, which elevate the water through tubes, and discharge it out the mine. It appears, from pretty exact calculations, that it would require about 550 men, or a power equal to that of 110 horses, to work the pump of one of the largest fire-engines now in use,( the diameter of whose cylinder is seventy inches) and thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this size constantly at work. And that as much water may be raised by an engine of this size kept constantly at work, as can be drawn up by 2520 men with rollers and buckets, after the manner now daily practiced in many mines; or as much as can be borne upon the shoulders of twice that number of men; as is said to be done in some of the mines of Peru. So great is the power of the air in one of those engines. There are four fire-engines belonging to this colliery; which, when all at work, discharge from it about 1228 gallons every minute, at thirteen strokes; 1,768,320 gallons every twenty - four hours. By the four here employed, nearly twice the above mentioned quantity of water might be discharged from mines that are not above sixty or seventy fathoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newcastle collieries, or in any of the English collieries, those of Whitehaven excepted. the reader may find an account of Savery's engines in Harris's Lexicon Technicum. Many great improvements have been made to it since, and are daily making; several of which are related in the Philosophical Transactions. The best account of it, its various improvements and uses is, I think, in Dr. Desagulier's course of experimental philosophy. vol.

I am however apprehensive, that such of your readers as are unacquainted with your subject, may not have the same relish for several parts of your performance. Much of the pleasure which we receive from descriptions of the country must arise from recalling to mind those rural scenes that have given us delight, and from comparing them with their representations; and observing with what art and judgement those representations are copied after nature. And although the scenes delineated in your poetic land skips, seem as beautifully varied, and as well adapted to give pleasure to the judicious as those that are most admired in other countries, and may serve as excellent models for the embellishment of rural situations: yet it must be owned that, in this part of your poem, you labour under some disadvantage, from the choice of your subject in a retired part; which does not fall so much under the eye of the curious as Windsor Forest and some other places, whose charms have been displayed by some of our best poets. However, very happily for you, though your Brother has devoted the largest share of his time and study this summer to adorning our New Church with his Painting, yet he has found leisure to make very exact Drawings of the paces your describe. These, as they are the best comment on this part of your work, will, I hope, in a great measure remove the difficulty here hinted at; and the Public will have the pleasure of seeing the sister arts mutually reflecting light upon each other, and conspiring, by a friendly emulation, to set off these beautiful scenes to the best advantage.","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["country",397,404],["land",677,681],["countries",811,820]],"pos_words":[["pleasure",26,34],["fondness",104,112],["eloquently",152,162],["relish",288,294],["pleasure",346,354],["delight",477,484],["poetic",670,676],["beautifully",697,708],["well",724,728],["pleasure",745,753],["judicious",761,770],["excellent",839,848],["best",1186,1190],["happily",1212,1219],["best",1463,1467],["work",1497,1501],["great",1522,1527],["pleasure",1603,1611],["friendly",1702,1710],["beautiful",1739,1748],["best",1763,1767],["advantage",1768,1777]],"neg_words":[["apprehensive",187,199],["disadvantage",975,987],["fall",1055,1059],["difficulty",1547,1557]],"events":[],"dates":[["this summer",1301,1312]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",143,148],["here",1558,1562]],"spa_preps":[["under",964,969],["under",1068,1073]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1285714286,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987601042},{"para_id":79,"paragraph":"Another part of your performance will, I am afraid, be attended with greater difficulties. Your descriptions of the country must be generally understood; and, like a fine picture, will be admired by many who do not know the original; although they will be read with most delight by those who are best acquainted with your subject. But few of your readers will have such a knowledge of mines as will enable them to follow you through their dark and intricate labyrinths. More especially, as these are a subject that has not, I think, before been attempted in verse. And yet they seem well to deserve the notice of our poets, as they abound in objects proper to excite admiration, and are one great source of the wealth and power of these kingdoms. Here it may be worth the while to stop a little, and reflect on the labour and dangers that They sustain, who, from the mines supply us with many necessaries and conveniences of life: what multitudes of people by them are maintained: what efforts of human reason are there exerted, in the most ingenious inventions: and what immense treasures are thence raised, by which numberless wheels are set in motion in the complicated machine of commerce. the subterranean regions, hitherto delineated y the luxuriant fancies of poets, are widely different from these great funds of treasure. And as the veracity of those poets, who have descended into the lower regions, hath often been called in question, some may even suspect that you also have indulged yourself in this poetic licence, and have related such things of these darks abodes as would best appear in verse, rather than as you really found them in nature. To obviate which suspicions, may it not be necessary to produce authentic vouchers of your having faithfully described such objects as occurred to you in the coal-mines? Had Cervantes taken this method, his wonderful account of a certain cave would perhaps have met with more credit than it now does, notwithstanding his artful insinuation of its having been believed by a very great scholar. The Explanatory Notes, which, agreeable to your request I send enclosed, and which you are at liberty to publish with your poem, may serve as a sort of circumstantial proof of the truth of your descriptions. You will readily perceive that the nature of your design would not allow me to write a history of collieries, or a philosophical dissertation on damps. I have therefore contented myself with relating a few facts which may throw some light on this part of your poem, and may help to render you description of the mines intelligible to your readers.","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["country",116,123],["regions",1211,1218],["regions",1401,1408]],"pos_words":[["like",159,163],["delight",271,278],["best",296,300],["intricate",448,457],["well",583,587],["abound",632,638],["proper",650,656],["excite",660,666],["admiration",667,677],["great",691,696],["worth",762,767],["ingenious",1041,1050],["immense",1072,1079],["luxuriant",1246,1255],["great",1306,1311],["treasure",1321,1329],["poetic",1513,1519],["best",1589,1593],["authentic",1723,1732],["faithfully",1757,1767],["wonderful",1866,1875],["great",2037,2042],["agreeable",2082,2091],["liberty",2146,2153],["readily",2269,2276],["intelligible",2578,2590]],"neg_words":[["afraid",44,50],["difficulties",77,89],["dark",439,443],["complicated",1161,1172],["suspect",1460,1467],["suspicions",1676,1686],["cave",1897,1901],["insinuation",1987,1998]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",164,170]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1014,1019]],"spa_preps":[["through",425,432],["into",1386,1390]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0886699507,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9922451377},{"para_id":80,"paragraph":"I am,&amp; c","file_id":"1755_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9834730625},{"para_id":81,"paragraph":"W.
