First, we note, lying to the south-east, the vale of Langdale, which will conduct the eye to the eye to the long lake of Winandermeres stretched nearly to the sea; or rather to the sands of the vast bay of Morcamb, serving here for the rim of this imaginary wheel;-- let us trace it in a direction from the south-east towards the south, and we shall next fix our eyes upon the vale of Coniston, running up likewise from the sea, but not( as all the other vallies do) to the nave of the wheel, and therefore it may be not inaptly represented as a broken spoke sticking in the rim. Looking forth again, with an inclination towards the west, immediately at our feet lies the vale of Duddon, in which is no lake, but a copious stream winding among fields, rocks, and mountains, and terminating its course in the sands of Duddon. The fourth vale, next to be observed, viz. that of the Esk, is of the same general character as the last, yet beautifully discriminated from it by peculiar features. Its stream passes under the woody steep upon which stands Muncaster Castle, the ancient seat of the Penningtons, and after forming a short and narrow aestuary enters the sea below the little town of Ravenglass. Next, almost due west, look down into, and along the deep valley of Wastdale, with its little chapel and half a dozen neat dwellings scattered upon a plain of meadow and corn-ground intersected with stone walls apparently innumerable, like a large piece of lawless patch-work, or an array of mathematical figures, such as in the ancient schools of geometry might have been sportivley and fantastically traved out upon sand. Beyond this little fertile plain lies, within its bed of steep mountains, the long, narrow, stern, and desolate Lake of Wastdale; and, beyond this, a dusky tract of level ground conducts the eye to the Irish Sea. The stream that issues from Wast Water is named the Irt, and falls into the aestuary of the River Esk. Next comes in view Ennerdale, with its lake of bold and somewhat savage shores. Its stream, the Ehen or Enna, flowing through a soft and fertile country, passes the town of Egremont-- and the ruins of the castle, then, seeming, like the other rivers, to break through the barrier of sand thrown up by the winds on this tempestuous coast, enters the Irish Sea. The vale of Buttermere, with the lake and village of that name, and Crummock Water, beyond, next present themselves. We will follow the main stream, the Cocker, through the fertile and beautiful vale of Lorton, till it is lost in the Derwent, below the noble ruins of Cockermouth Castle. Lastly, Borrowdale, of which the vale of Keswick is only a continuation, stretching due north, brings us to a point nearly opposite to the vale of Winandermere with which we began. From this it will appear, that the image of a wheel, thus far exact, is little more than one half complete; but the deficiency on the eastern side may be supplied by the vales of Wytheburn, Ulswater, Hawswater, and the vale of Grasmere and Rydal; none of these, however, run up to the central point between Great Gavel and Scawfell. From this, hitherto our central point, take a flight of not more than three or four miles eastward to the ridge of Hellvellyn, and you will look down upon Wytheburn and St. John's Vale, which are a branch of the vale of Keswick; upon Ulswater, stretching due east, and not far beyond to the south-east,( though from this point not visible,) lie the vale and lake of Hawswater; and lastly, the vale of Grasmere, Rydal, and Ambleside, brings you back to Winandermere, thus completing, though on the eastern side in a somewhat irregular manner, the representative figure of the wheel.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Great Gavel",262,273],["Scawfell",278,286],["Langdale",735,743],["Coniston",1067,1075],["Duddon",1362,1368],["Duddon",1499,1505],["Castle",1741,1747],["Ravenglass",1872,1882],["Wastdale",1952,1960],["Wastdale",2428,2436],["Irish Sea",2510,2519],["Wast Water",2549,2559],["River Esk",2613,2622],["Ennerdale",2643,2652],["Irish Sea",2973,2982],["Buttermere",2996,3006],["Crummock Water",3052,3066],["Cocker",3137,3143],["Lorton",3187,3193],["Derwent",3218,3225],["Cockermouth",3252,3263],["Castle",3264,3270],["Borrowdale",3280,3290],["Keswick",3313,3320],["Winandermere",3419,3431],["Ulswater",3643,3651],["Grasmere",3680,3688],["Rydal",3693,3698],["Great Gavel",3760,3771],["Scawfell",3776,3784],["St. John's Vale",3955,3970],["Keswick",4006,4013],["Ulswater",4020,4028],["Grasmere",4187,4195],["Rydal",4197,4202],["Ambleside",4208,4217],["Winandermere",4238,4250]],"geonouns":[["point",212,217],["mountains",251,260],["station",319,326],["mountains",374,383],["summit",434,440],["feet",535,539],["point",602,607],["vale",727,731],["lake",795,799],["sea",841,844],["sands",863,868],["bay",881,884],["vale",1059,1063],["sea",1106,1109],["feet",1340,1344],["vale",1354,1358],["lake",1385,1389],["stream",1405,1411],["winding",1412,1419],["fields",1426,1432],["rocks",1434,1439],["mountains",1445,1454],["sands",1490,1495],["vale",1518,1522],["stream",1677,1683],["passes",1684,1690],["seat",1761,1765],["sea",1843,1846],["town",1864,1868],["valley",1942,1948],["chapel",1978,1984],["meadow",2043,2049],["ground",2059,2065],["stone",2083,2088],["walls",2089,2094],["schools",2221,2228],["bed",2358,2361],["mountains",2371,2380],["ground",2479,2485],["stream",2525,2531],["lake",2663,2667],["shores",2696,2702],["stream",2708,2714],["country",2769,2776],["passes",2778,2784],["town",2789,2793],["castle",2829,2835],["rivers",2867,2873],["coast",2955,2960],["vale",2988,2992],["lake",3017,3021],["village",3026,3033],["stream",3125,3131],["vale",3179,3183],["vale",3305,3309],["point",3382,3387],["vale",3411,3415],["vales",3623,3628],["vale",3672,3676],["point",3746,3751],["point",3818,3823],["ridge",3892,3897],["vale",3998,4002],["point",4107,4112],["vale",4135,4139],["lake",4144,4148],["vale",4179,4183]],"pos_words":[["readily",122,129],["top",233,236],["like",644,648],["beautifully",1617,1628],["neat",2002,2006],["like",2119,2123],["work",2155,2159],["fantastically",2272,2285],["fertile",2327,2334],["soft",2752,2756],["fertile",2761,2768],["like",2852,2856],["fertile",3157,3164],["beautiful",3169,3178],["noble",3237,3242]],"neg_words":[["cloud",335,340],["lying",698,703],["imaginary",930,939],["broken",1228,1234],["lies",1345,1349],["peculiar",1654,1662],["steep",1707,1712],["lawless",2141,2148],["lies",2341,2345],["steep",2365,2370],["stern",2400,2405],["desolate",2411,2419],["issues",2537,2543],["falls",2582,2587],["savage",2689,2695],["ruins",2816,2821],["break",2878,2883],["lost",3206,3210],["ruins",3243,3248],["deficiency",3569,3579],["lie",4127,4130],["irregular",4310,4319]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["half a mile",402,413],["three or four miles",3856,3875]],"loc_advs":[["between",356,363],["here",905,909]],"spa_preps":[["above",469,474],["among",1420,1425],["next to",1524,1531],["under",1691,1696],["below",1847,1852],["down",1912,1916],["into",1917,1921],["along",1927,1932],["out",2293,2296],["within",2347,2353],["beyond",2443,2449],["into",2588,2592],["through",2742,2749],["through",2884,2891],["beyond",3068,3074],["through",3145,3152],["below",3227,3232],["opposite",3395,3403],["between",3752,3759],["down",3931,3935],["beyond",4063,4069]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0172839506,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.7133201361},{"para_id":21,"paragraph":"Anciently spelt Langden, and so called by the old inhabitants to this day-- dead, from which the latter part of the word is derived, being in many parts of England a name for a valley.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Langden",16,23],["England",156,163]],"geonouns":[["valley",177,183]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["dead",76,80]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0555555556,"vader_sentiment":-0.65,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9586504102},{"para_id":22,"paragraph":"Such, concisely given, is the general topographical view of the country of the Lakes in the north of England; and it may be observed, that, from the circumference to the centre, that is, from the sea or plain country to the mountain stations specified, there is-- in the several ridges that enclose these vales and divide them from each other, I mean in the forms and surfaces, first of the swelling grounds, next of the hills and rocks, and lastly of the mountains-- an ascent of almost regular gradation from elegance and richness to the highest point of grandeur and sublimity. It follows therefore from this, first, that these rocks, hills, and mountains, must present themselves to view in stages rising above each other, the mountains clustering together towards the central point; and, next, that an observer familiar with the several vales, must from their various position in relation to sub, have had before his eys every possible embelishment of beauty, dignity, and splendour, which light and shadow can bestow on objects so diversified. For example, in the vale of Winandermere, if the spectator looks for gentle and lovely scenes, his eye is turned towards the south; if for the grand, towards the north; in the vale of Keswick, which( as hath been said) lies almost due north of this, it is directly the reverse. Hence, when the sun is setting in summar far to the north-west, it is seen by the spectator from the shores or breast of Winandermere, resting among the summits of the loftiest mountains, some of which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by the blaze of light which will perhaps be half or wholly hidden by clouds, or by the blaze of light which the orb diffuses around it; and the surface of the lake will reflect before the eye the correspondent colours through every variety of beauty, and through all degrees of splendour. In the vale of Keswick, at the same period, the sun sets over the humbler regions of the landscape, and showers down upon them the radiance which at once veils and glorifies,-- sending forth, meanwhile, broad streams of rosy, crimson, purple, or golden light, towards the grand mountains in the south and south-east, which, thus illuminated, with all their projections and cavities, and with an intermixture of solemn shadows, are seen distinctly through a cool and clear atmosphere. Of course, there is as marked a difference between the noontide appearance of these two opposite vales. The bedimming haze that overspreads the south, and the clear atmosphere and determined shadows of the clouds in the north, at the same time of the day, are each seen in these several vales, with a contrast as striking. The reader will easily conceive in what degree the intermediate vales partake of the same variety.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",79,84],["England",101,108],["Winandermere",1078,1090],["Keswick",1234,1241],["Winandermere",1449,1461],["Keswick",1886,1893]],"geonouns":[["country",64,71],["sea",196,199],["country",209,216],["mountain",224,232],["stations",233,241],["ridges",279,285],["vales",305,310],["grounds",400,407],["hills",421,426],["rocks",431,436],["point",548,553],["rocks",631,636],["hills",638,643],["mountains",649,658],["mountains",731,740],["point",781,786],["vales",842,847],["vale",1070,1074],["vale",1226,1230],["shores",1429,1435],["summits",1481,1488],["mountains",1505,1514],["lake",1741,1745],["vale",1878,1882],["regions",1945,1952],["landscape",1960,1969],["streams",2080,2087],["mountains",2149,2158],["vales",2452,2457],["vales",2642,2647],["vales",2742,2747]],"pos_words":[["elegance",511,519],["richness",524,532],["grandeur",557,565],["beauty",957,963],["dignity",965,972],["diversified",1037,1048],["gentle",1119,1125],["lovely",1130,1136],["grand",1193,1198],["variety",1814,1821],["beauty",1825,1831],["radiance",2002,2010],["rosy",2091,2095],["golden",2117,2123],["grand",2143,2148],["cool",2328,2332],["clear",2337,2342],["striking",2668,2676],["variety",2768,2775]],"neg_words":[["swelling",391,399],["lies",1269,1273],["solemn",2282,2288],["haze",2473,2477]],"events":[],"dates":[["the clear",2510,2519],["the day",2602,2609]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",253,258],["there",2366,2371],["between",2398,2405],["opposite",2443,2451]],"spa_preps":[["above",709,714],["together",752,760],["among",1471,1476],["around",1707,1713],["through",1800,1807],["through",1837,1844],["over",1928,1932],["down",1983,1987],["through",2318,2325]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0655021834,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.998177886},{"para_id":23,"paragraph":"I do not indeed know any tract of country in which, within so narrow a compass, may be found an equal variety in the influences of light and shadow upon the sublime or beautiful features of landscape; and it is owing to the combined circumstances to which I have directed the readers attention.

With this blue or grey colour is frequently intermixed a red tinge, proceeding from the iron that interveins the stone, and impregnates the soil. The iron is the principle of decomposition in these rocks; and hence, when they become pulverized, the elementary particles crumbling down overspread in many places the steep and almost precipitous sides of the mountains with an intermixture of colours, like the compound hues of a dove's neck. When, in the heat of advancing summer, the fresh green tint of herbage has somewhat faded, it is again revived by the appearance of the fern profusely spread over the same ground; and, upon this plant, more than upon any thing else, do the changes which the seasons make in the colouring of the mountains depend. About the first week in October, the rich green, which prevailed through the whole summer, is usually passed away. The brilliant and various colours of the fern are then in harmony with the autumnal woods; bright yellow or lemon colour, at the base of the mountains, melting gradually, through orange, to a dark russet brown towards the summits, where the plant, being more exposed to the weather, is in a more advanced state of decay. Neither heath nor furze are generally found upon the sides of these mountains, though in some places they are richly adorned by them. We may add, that the mountains are of height sufficient to have the surface towards the summits softened by distance, and to imbibe the finest aerial hues. In common also with other mountains, their apparent forms and colours are perpetually changed by the clouds and vapours which float around them: the effect indeed of mist or haze, in a country of this character, is like that of magic.

This, as must be obvious, is partly owning to the forms of the mountains, which, of course, are not affected by the seasons; but also, in no small degree, to the greater variety that exists in their winter than in their summer colouring. This variety is such, and so harmoniously preserved, that is leaves little cause of regret when the splendour of autumn is passed away. The oak-coppices, upon the sides of the mountains, retain russet leaves; the birch stands conspicuous with its silver stem and puce-coloured twigs; the hollies, with green leaves and scarlet berries, have come forth to view from among the deciduous trees, whose summer foliage had concealed them; the ivy is now plentifully apparent upon the stems and boughs of the trees, and upon the steep rocks. In place of the deep summer-green of the herbage and fern, many rich colours play into each other over the surface of the mountains; turf( the tints of which are interchangeably tawny-green, olive, and brown,) beds of withered fern, and grey rocks, being harmoniously blended together. The mosses and lichens are never so fresh and flourishing as in winter, if it be not a season of frost; and their minute beauties prodigally adorn the fore-ground. Wherever we turn, we find these productions of nature, to which winter is rather favourable than unkindly, scattered over the walls, banks of earth, rocks, and stones, and upon the trunks of trees, with the intermixture of several species of small fern, now green and fresh; and, to the observing passenger, their forms and colours are a source of inexhaustible admiration. Add to this the hoar-frost and snow, with all the varieties they create, and which volumes would not be sufficient to describe. I will content myself with one instance of the colouring produced by snow, which may not be uninteresting to painters. It is extracted from the memorandum-book of a friend; and for its accuracy I can speak, having been an eye-witness of the appearance. \" I observed,\" says he,\" the beautiful effect of the drifted snow upon the mountains, and the perfect tone of colour. From the top of the mountains downwards a rich olive was produced by the powdery snow and the grass, which olive was warmed with a little brown, and in this way harmoniously combined, by insensible goodness, with the white. The drifting took away the monotony of snow; and the whole of Grasmere, seen from the terrace walk in Easedale, was as varied, perhaps more so, than even in the pomp of autumn. In the distance was Loughrigg Fell, the basin-wall of the lake: this, from the summit downward, was a rich orange-olive; then the lake of a bright olive-green, nearly the same tint as the snow-powdered mountain tops and high slopes in Easedale; and lastly, the church with its firs forming the centre of the view. Next to the church came nine distinguishable hills, six of them with woody sides turned towards us, all of them oak-copses with their bright red leaves and snow-powdered twigs; these hills-- so variously situated in relation to each other, and to the view in general, so variously powdered, some only enough to give the herbage a rich brown tint, one intensely white and lighting up all the others-- were yet so placed, as in the most inobtrusive manner to harmonise by contrast with a perfect naked, snowless bleak summit in the far distance.\"","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Grasmere",2629,2637],["Easedale",2669,2677],["Loughrigg Fell",2764,2778],["Easedale",2979,2987]],"geonouns":[["point",128,133],["mountains",310,319],["coppices",629,637],["mountains",661,670],["trees",870,875],["trees",987,992],["rocks",1013,1018],["mountains",1142,1151],["beds",1230,1234],["rocks",1262,1267],["ground",1462,1468],["walls",1596,1601],["banks",1603,1608],["rocks",1619,1624],["stones",1630,1636],["trees",1661,1666],["mountains",2300,2309],["top",2352,2355],["mountains",2363,2372],["terrace",2653,2660],["wall",2790,2794],["lake",2802,2806],["summit",2823,2829],["lake",2874,2878],["mountain",2946,2954],["slopes",2969,2975],["church",3005,3011],["church",3070,3076],["hills",3103,3108],["summit",3574,3580]],"pos_words":[["superiority",112,123],["strikingly",200,210],["variety",417,424],["variety",490,497],["harmoniously",514,526],["rich",1084,1088],["harmoniously",1275,1287],["fresh",1342,1347],["flourishing",1352,1363],["fresh",1738,1743],["admiration",1832,1842],["sufficient",1948,1958],["beautiful",2254,2263],["perfect",2319,2326],["rich",2385,2389],["harmoniously",2504,2516],["goodness",2541,2549],["rich",2846,2850],["bright",2884,2890],["tops",2955,2959],["bright",3192,3198],["enough",3359,3365],["rich",3388,3392],["perfect",3544,3551]],"neg_words":[["regret",569,575],["conspicuous",711,722],["steep",1007,1012],["frost",1403,1408],["unkindly",1567,1575],["frost",1865,1870],["insensible",2530,2540],["monotony",2594,2602],["bleak",3568,3573]],"events":[],"dates":[["winter",224,230],["summer",239,245],["the seasons",359,370],["winter",446,452],["summer",467,473],["autumn",598,604],["summer",883,889],["summer",1041,1047],["winter",1370,1376],["a season",1391,1399],["winter",1534,1540],["autumn",2736,2742]],"times":[["minute",1420,1426]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["away",615,619],["together",1296,1304],["downwards",2373,2382]],"spa_preps":[["over",169,173],["among",850,855],["into",1102,1106],["over",1118,1122],["over",1587,1591],["away",2585,2589]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0485436893,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977452159},{"para_id":28,"paragraph":"Having spoken of the forms, surface, and colour of the mountains, let us descend into the Vales. Though these have been represented under the general image of the spokes of a wheel, they are, for the most part, winding; the windings of many being abrupt and intricate. And, it may be observed, that in one circumstance, the general shape of them all has been determined by that primitive conformation through which so many became receptacles of lakes. For they are not formed, as are most of the celebrated Welsh vallies, by an approximation of the sloping bases of the opposite mountains towards each other, leaving little more between than a channel for the passage of a hasty river; but the bottom of these vallies is, for the most part, a spacious and gently declining area, apparently level as the floor of a temple, or the surface of a lake, and beautifully broken, in many cases, by rocks and hills, which rise up like islands from the plain. In such of the vallies as make many windings, these level areas open upon the traveller in succession, divided from each other sometimes by a mutual approximation of the hills, leaving only passage for a river, sometimes by correspondent windings, without such approximation; and sometimes by a bold advance of one mountain toward that which is opposite to it. It may here be observed with propriety, that the several rocks and hills, which have been described as rising up like islands from the level area of the vale, have regulated the choice of the inhabitants in the situation of their dwellings. Where none of these are found, and the inclination of the ground is not sufficiently rapid easily to carry off the waters,( as in the higher part of Langdale, for instance,) the houses are not sprinkled over the middle part of the vales, but confined to their sides, being placed merely so far up the mountain as to be protected from the floods. But where these rocks and hills have been scattered over the plain of the vale,( as in Grasmere, Donnerdale, Eskdale,&amp; c.) the beauty which they give to the scene is much heightened by a single cottage, or cluster of cottages, that will be almost always found under them, or upon their sides; dryness and shelter having tempted the Dalesmen to fix their inhabitations there.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Langdale",1701,1709],["Grasmere",1985,1993],["Donnerdale",1995,2005]],"geonouns":[["mountains",55,64],["winding",211,218],["windings",224,232],["lakes",445,450],["mountains",579,588],["channel",644,651],["river",679,684],["lake",842,846],["rocks",890,895],["hills",900,905],["islands",926,933],["windings",986,994],["hills",1120,1125],["river",1154,1159],["windings",1188,1196],["mountain",1265,1273],["rocks",1368,1373],["hills",1378,1383],["islands",1429,1436],["vale",1464,1468],["ground",1610,1616],["waters",1667,1673],["houses",1730,1736],["vales",1783,1788],["mountain",1853,1861],["rocks",1914,1919],["hills",1924,1929],["vale",1972,1976],["cottage",2096,2103],["cottages",2119,2127]],"pos_words":[["intricate",258,267],["celebrated",496,506],["spacious",743,751],["beautifully",852,863],["like",921,925],["like",1424,1428],["sufficiently",1624,1636],["rapid",1637,1642],["beauty",2029,2035]],"neg_words":[["abrupt",247,253],["primitive",378,387],["hasty",673,678],["declining",763,772],["broken",864,870],["confined",1794,1802]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",629,636],["without",1198,1205],["here",1318,1322],["there",2270,2275]],"spa_preps":[["into",81,85],["under",132,137],["through",401,408],["opposite",570,578],["toward",1274,1280],["opposite",1295,1303],["over",1755,1759],["over",1950,1954],["under",2162,2167]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0169491525,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981239438},{"para_id":29,"paragraph":"I shall now speak of the Lakes of this country.

But, though the forms of the large lakes have this advantage, it is nevertheless a circumstance favourable to the beauty of the country, that the largest of them are comparatively small; and that the same valley generally furnishes a succession of lakes, instead of being filled with one. The vallies in North Wales, as hath been observed, are not formed for the reception of lakes; those of Switzerland, Scotland, and this part of the North of England, are so formed; but, in Switzerland and Scotland, the proportion of diffused water is often too great, as at the lake of Geneva for instance, and in most of the Scotch lakes. No doubt it sounds magnificent and flatters the imagination, to hear at distance of expanses of water so many leagues in length and miles in width; and such ample room may be delightful to the fresh-water sailor, scudding with a lively breeze amid the rapidly-shifting scenery. But, who ever travelled along the banks of Loch Lomond, variegated as the lower part is by islands, without feeling that a speedier termination of the long vista of blank water would be acceptable; and without wishing for an interposition of green meadows, tress, and cottages, and a sparkling stream to run by his side? In fact, a notion of grandeur, as connected with magnitude, has seduced persons of taste into a general mistake upon this subject. It is much more desirable, for the purposes of pleasure, that lakes should be numerous, and small or middle-sized, than large, not only for commmunication by walks and rides, but for variety, and for recurrence of similar appearances. To illustrate this by one instance:-- how pleasing is it to have a ready and frequent opportunity of watching, at the outlet of a lake, the stream pushing its way among the rocks in lively contrast with the stillness from which it has escaped; and how amusing to compare its noisy and turbulent motions with the gentle playfulness of the breezes, that may be starting up or wandered here and there over the faintly-rippled surface of the broad water! I may add, as a general remark, that, in lakes of great width, the shores cannot be distinctly seen at the same time, and therefore contribute little to mutual illustration and ornament; and, if the opposite shores are out of sight of each other, like those of the American and Asiatic lakes, then unfortunately the traveller is reminded of a nobler object; he has the blankness of a sea-prospect without the grandeur and accompanying sense of power.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Winandermere",126,138],["Ulswater",140,148],["Ulswater",385,393],["North Wales",975,986],["Switzerland",1063,1074],["Scotland",1076,1084],["England",1116,1123],["Switzerland",1148,1159],["Scotland",1164,1172],["Loch Lomond",1620,1631]],"geonouns":[["lakes",58,63],["country",72,79],["point",225,230],["lake",274,278],["river",324,329],["winding",354,361],["windings",488,496],["lake",586,590],["lakes",706,711],["country",799,806],["valley",876,882],["lakes",919,924],["lakes",1047,1052],["water",1201,1206],["lake",1237,1241],["lakes",1292,1297],["water",1395,1400],["water",1498,1503],["banks",1611,1616],["islands",1668,1675],["water",1748,1753],["meadows",1825,1832],["cottages",1845,1853],["stream",1871,1877],["lakes",2091,2096],["outlet",2382,2388],["lake",2394,2398],["stream",2404,2410],["rocks",2437,2442],["water",2708,2713],["lakes",2756,2761],["shores",2782,2788],["shores",2923,2929],["lakes",3001,3006],["sea",3099,3102]],"pos_words":[["magnificent",312,323],["appropriate",546,557],["advantage",722,731],["beauty",785,791],["great",1220,1225],["magnificent",1318,1329],["ample",1456,1461],["delightful",1474,1484],["fresh",1492,1497],["lively",1528,1534],["breeze",1535,1541],["sparkling",1861,1870],["grandeur",1919,1927],["desirable",2045,2054],["pleasure",2076,2084],["variety",2212,2219],["pleasing",2306,2314],["ready",2331,2336],["lively",2446,2452],["amusing",2516,2523],["gentle",2576,2582],["great",2765,2770],["like",2962,2966],["grandeur",3124,3132]],"neg_words":[["lose",232,236],["peculiar",253,261],["obstructed",439,449],["confined",519,527],["doubt",1302,1307],["mistake",2002,2009],["noisy",2539,2544],["turbulent",2549,2558],["unfortunately",3013,3026],["object",3065,3071]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",1677,1684],["without",1779,1786],["here",2647,2651],["there",2656,2661],["without",3112,3119]],"spa_preps":[["amid",1542,1546],["along",1601,1606],["into",1987,1991],["among",2427,2432],["over",2662,2666],["opposite",2914,2922],["out",2934,2937]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0540540541,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981518388},{"para_id":32,"paragraph":"As the comparatively small size of the lakes in the North of England is favourable to the production of variegated landscape, their boundary-line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented. That uniformity, which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded, is broken by the secondary agents of nature, ever at work to supply the deficiencies of the mould in which things were originally cast. Using the word deficiencies, I do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite. The bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines, and these parallel to each other; the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counter-parts or in mutual reflection like the billows of a troubled sea; and the impression be, from its very simplicity, more awful and sublime. Sublimity is the result of Nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the earth; but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty, by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole. This is every where exemplified along the margin of these lakes. Masses of rock, that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters, lie frequently like stranded ships; or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers; or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood. The smallest rivulet-- one whoe silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather-- so faint is the dimple made by it on the surface of the smooth lake-- will be found to have been not useless in the shaping, by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood, a curve that would not otherwise have existed. But the more powerful brooks, encroaching upon the level of the lake, have, in course of time, given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that constracts boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore; while their flat or gently-sloping surfaces never fail to introduce, into the midst of desolation and barrenness, the elements of fertility, even where the habitations of men may not have been raised. These alluvial promontories, however, threathen, in some places, to bisect the waters which the have long adorned; and, in course of ages, they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools; which, in their turn, will finally be filled up. But, checking these intrusive calculations, let us rather be content with appearances as they are, and pursue in imagination the meandering shores, whether rugged steeps, admitting no cultivation, descend into the water; or gently-sloping lawns and rich woods, or flat and fertile meadows stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains. Among minuter recommendations will be noted with pleasure the curved rim of fine blue gravel thrown up by the waves, especially in bays exposed to the setting-in of strong winds; and, bordering the lake, groves, if I may so call them, of reeds and bulrushes; or plots of water-lilies lifting their large target-shaped leaves to the breeze, while the white flower is heaving upon the wave.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["England",61,68]],"geonouns":[["lakes",39,44],["landscape",115,124],["line",141,145],["grounds",271,278],["mountains",311,320],["water",349,354],["region",597,603],["mountains",607,616],["lines",719,724],["vale",793,797],["sea",887,890],["lakes",1276,1281],["rock",1293,1297],["waters",1361,1367],["ships",1398,1403],["piers",1455,1460],["wood",1514,1518],["brooks",1865,1871],["lake",1907,1911],["promontories",1959,1971],["shore",2072,2077],["promontories",2295,2307],["waters",2359,2365],["lakes",2447,2452],["shores",2692,2698],["water",2766,2771],["lawns",2791,2796],["woods",2806,2811],["meadows",2833,2840],["lake",2875,2879],["mountains",2888,2897],["bays",3030,3034],["lake",3097,3101],["groves",3103,3109],["water",3170,3175]],"pos_words":[["gracefully",172,182],["work",420,424],["stronger",571,579],["excite",641,647],["profound",784,792],["like",856,860],["sublime",956,963],["great",1007,1012],["beauty",1140,1146],["consistent",1200,1210],["like",1384,1388],["compact",1426,1433],["silent",1552,1558],["smooth",1674,1680],["powerful",1856,1864],["ample",1953,1958],["sweeping",1975,1983],["rich",2801,2805],["fertile",2825,2832],["recommendations",2913,2928],["pleasure",2948,2956],["fine",2975,2979],["strong",3064,3070],["breeze",3231,3237]],"neg_words":[["primitive",242,251],["broken",370,376],["deficiencies",439,451],["deficiencies",518,530],["peculiarly",620,630],["troubled",878,886],["awful",946,951],["lie",1369,1372],["scarcely",1569,1577],["faint",1621,1626],["useless",1719,1726],["fail",2129,2133],["desolation",2166,2176],["insignificant",2482,2495],["intrusive",2572,2581]],"events":[],"dates":[["a season",1592,1600]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["opposite",764,772]],"spa_preps":[["among",279,284],["along",1250,1255],["into",1344,1348],["opposite",2063,2071],["into",2148,2152],["into",2464,2468],["into",2757,2761],["between",2849,2856]],"normalised_sentiment":0.03125,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974192381},{"para_id":33,"paragraph":"The Islands are neither so numerous nor so beautiful as might be expected from the account that has been given of the manner in which the level areas of the vales are so frequently diversified by rocks, hills, and hillocks, scattered over them; nor are they ornamented, as are several islands by the lakes in Scotland and Ireland, by the remains of old castles or other places of defence, or of monastic edifices.

These are found in some of the vallies, and are numerous upon the mountains. A Tarn, in a Vale, implies, for the most part, that the bed of the vale is not happily formed; that the water of the brooks can neither wholly escape, nor diffuse itself over a large area. Accordingly, in such situations, Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground; but this is not always the case, and in the cultivated parts of the country, when the shores of the Tarn are determined, it differs only from the Lake in being smaller, and in belonging mostly to a smaller valley, or circular recess. Of this class of miniature lakes Loughrigg Tarn, near Grasmere, is the most beautiful example. It has a margin of green firm meadows, of rocks, and rocky woods, a few reeds here, a little company of water-lilies there, with beds of gravel or stone beyond; a tiny stream issuing neither briskly nor sluggishly out of it; but its feeding rills, from the shortness of their course, so small as to be scarcely visible. Five or six cottages are reflected in its peaceful bosom; rocky and barren steeps rise up above the hanging enclosures; and the solemn pikes of Langdale overlook, from a distance, the low cultivated ridge of land that forms the northern boundary of this small, quiet, and fertile domain. The mountain Tarns can only be recommended to the notice of the inquisitive traveller who has time to spare. They are difficult to access and naked; yet some of them are, in their permanent forms, very grand; and there are accidents of things which would make the meanest of them interesting. At all events, one of these pools is an acceptable sight to the mountain wanderer, not merely as an incident that diversifies the prospect, but as forming in his mind a center or conspicuous point to which objects, otherwise disconnected or unsubordinated, may be referred. Some few have a varied outline, with bold heath-clad promontories; and, as they mostly lie at the foot of a steep precipice, the water, where the sun is not shining upon it, appears black and sullen; and, round the margin, huge stones and masses of rock are scattered; some defying conjecture as to the means by which they came thither, and others obviously fallen from on high-- the contribution of ages! A not unpleasing sadness is induced by this perplexity, and these images of decay; while the prospect of a body of pure water unattended with groves and other cheerful rural images by which fresh water is usually accompanied, and unable to give any furtherance to the meagre vegetation around it-- excites a sense of some repulsive power strongly put forth, and thus deepens the melancholy natural to such scenes. Nor is the feeling of solitude often more forcibly or more solemnly impressed than by the side of one of these mountain pools: though desolate and forbidding, it seems a distinct place to repair to; yet where the visitants must be rare, and there can be no disturbance. Water Fowl flock hither; and the lonely Angler may oftentimes here be seen; but the imagination, not content with this scanty allowance of society, is tempted to attribute a voluntary power to every change which takes place in such a spot, whether it be the breeze that wanders over the surface of the water, or the splendid lights of evening resting upon it in the midst of awful precipices.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",17,22],["Loughrigg Tarn",763,777],["Grasmere",784,792],["Langdale",1289,1297]],"geonouns":[["country",80,87],["water",111,116],["mountains",197,206],["bed",264,267],["vale",275,279],["water",312,317],["brooks",325,331],["ground",488,494],["country",564,571],["shores",582,588],["valley",702,708],["lakes",757,762],["meadows",855,862],["rocks",867,872],["woods",884,889],["water",929,934],["beds",954,958],["stone",972,977],["stream",993,999],["cottages",1157,1165],["pikes",1280,1285],["ridge",1344,1349],["land",1353,1357],["mountain",1437,1445],["mountain",1790,1798],["point",1917,1922],["promontories",2053,2065],["foot",2098,2102],["precipice",2114,2123],["water",2129,2134],["stones",2228,2234],["rock",2249,2253],["water",2526,2531],["groves",2548,2554],["water",2602,2607],["mountain",2931,2939],["water",3392,3397],["precipices",3471,3481]],"pos_words":[["happily",287,294],["beautiful",806,815],["peaceful",1187,1195],["quiet",1406,1411],["fertile",1417,1424],["recommended",1464,1475],["grand",1635,1640],["interesting",1713,1724],["contribution",2384,2396],["pure",2521,2525],["cheerful",2565,2573],["fresh",2596,2601],["excites",2704,2711],["impressed",2888,2897],["breeze",3348,3354],["splendid",3406,3414]],"neg_words":[["omit",34,38],["rocky",878,883],["shortness",1082,1091],["scarcely",1127,1135],["rocky",1203,1208],["barren",1213,1219],["solemn",1273,1279],["overlook",1298,1306],["difficult",1551,1560],["conspicuous",1905,1916],["lie",2087,2090],["steep",2108,2113],["sullen",2192,2198],["fallen",2358,2364],["sadness",2423,2430],["perplexity",2450,2460],["decay",2482,2487],["unable",2636,2642],["repulsive",2728,2737],["melancholy",2785,2795],["desolate",2954,2962],["forbidding",2967,2977],["disturbance",3077,3088],["lonely",3123,3129],["awful",3465,3470]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["evening",3425,3432]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",903,907],["there",942,947],["above",1235,1240],["there",1646,1651],["there",3061,3066],["hither",3107,3113],["here",3152,3156]],"spa_preps":[["over",378,382],["near",779,783],["beyond",978,984],["out",1039,1042],["round",2205,2210],["around",2692,2698],["over",3368,3372]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.03,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966663718},{"para_id":38,"paragraph":"\" There, sometimes does a leaping fish Send through the tarn a lonely cheer; The crags repeat the raven's croak In symphony austere: Thither the rainbow comes, the cloud And mists that spread the flying shroud, And sunbeams, and the sounding blast.\"--","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["tarn",56,60],["crags",81,86]],"pos_words":[["cheer",70,75]],"neg_words":[["lonely",63,69],["austere",124,131],["cloud",164,169],["mists",174,179],["shroud",203,209]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["through",44,51]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.1428571429,"vader_sentiment":0.2,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969787598},{"para_id":39,"paragraph":"It will be observed that this country is bounded on the south and east by the sea, which combines beautifully, from many elevated points, with the inland scenery; and, from the bay of Morcamb, the sloping shores and back-ground of distant mountains are seen composing pictures equally distinguished for grandeur and amenity.

The same is expressed by the beauty and intricacy with which the fields and coppice-woods are often intermingled: the plough of the first settlers having followed naturally the veins of richer, dryer, or less stony soil; and thus it has shaped out an intermixture of wood and lawn, with a grace and wildness which it would have been impossible for the hand of studied art to produce.

The country is, indeed, subject to much bad weather, and it has been ascertained that twice as much rain falls here as in many parts of the island; but the number of black drizzling days, that blot out the face of things, is by no means proportionally great. Nor is a continuance of thick, flagging, damp air, so common as in the West of England and Ireland. The rain here comes down heartily, and is frequently succeeded by clear, bright weather, when every brook is vocal, and every torrent sonorous; brooks and torrents, which are never muddy, even in the heaviest floods, except after a drought they happen to defiled for a short time by waters that have swept along dusty roads, or broken out into ploughed fields. Days of unsettled weather, with partial showers, are very frequent; but the showers, darkening or brightening as they fly from hill to hill, are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear. Vapours exhaling from the lakes and meadows after sun-rise, in a hot season, or, in moist weather, brooding upon the heights, or descending towards the vallies with inaudible motion, give a visionary character to every thing around them; and are in themselves so beautiful, as to dispose us to enter into the feelings of those simple nations( such as the Laplanders of this day) by whom they are taken for guardian deities of the mountains; or to sympathise with others who have fancied these delicate apparitions to be the spirits of their deceased ancestors.

Such clouds, cleaving to their stations, or lifting up suddenly their glittering heads from behind rocky barriers, or hurrying out of sight with speed of the sharpest edge, will often tempt an inhabitant to congratualte himself on belonging to a country of mists, and clouds, and storms, and make him think of the blank sky of Egypt, and of the cerulean vacancy of Italy, as an unanimated and even sad spectacle. The atmosphere, however, as in every other country subject to much rain, is frequently unfavourable to landscape, especially when keen winds succeed the rain, which are apt to produce coldness, spottiness, and an unmeaning or repulsive detail in the distance;-- a sunless frost, under a canopy of leaden and shapeless clouds, is, as far as it allows things to be seen, equally disagreeable.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["England",549,556],["Ireland",561,568],["Italy",2455,2460]],"geonouns":[["region",94,100],["landscapes",133,143],["country",215,222],["island",351,357],["common",524,530],["brook",670,675],["brooks",714,720],["waters",853,859],["roads",888,893],["fields",923,929],["hill",1058,1062],["hill",1066,1070],["lakes",1209,1214],["meadows",1219,1226],["mountains",1613,1622],["hill",1793,1797],["mountains",1995,2004],["stations",2121,2129],["heads",2171,2176],["edge",2257,2261],["country",2336,2343],["country",2546,2553],["landscape",2606,2615]],"pos_words":[["proper",10,16],["fortunate",200,209],["great",463,468],["heartily",595,603],["succeeded",623,632],["clear",636,641],["bright",643,649],["grateful",1085,1093],["finely",1110,1116],["visionary",1373,1382],["beautiful",1446,1455],["delicate",1676,1684],["tops",1798,1802],["glorious",1891,1899],["sufficient",2008,2018],["sharpest",2248,2256],["tempt",2274,2279],["keen",2633,2637],["succeed",2644,2651]],"neg_words":[["bad",251,254],["falls",316,321],["flagging",501,509],["torrent",696,703],["muddy",751,756],["drought",802,809],["dusty",882,887],["broken",898,904],["unsettled",939,948],["sad",1148,1151],["inaudible",1348,1357],["mysterious",2066,2076],["rocky",2189,2194],["mists",2347,2352],["sad",2488,2491],["repulsive",2729,2738],["frost",2775,2780],["disagreeable",2880,2892]],"events":[],"dates":[["black drizzling days",377,397],["Days",931,935],["the ear",1174,1181],["a hot season",1246,1258],["this day",1552,1560],["daily",2030,2035]],"times":[["hourly",2040,2046]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",322,326],["here",579,583]],"spa_preps":[["out",409,412],["down",590,594],["along",876,881],["out",905,908],["into",909,913],["around",1408,1414],["into",1483,1487],["behind",2182,2188],["out",2217,2220],["under",2782,2787]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0039215686,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9746050835},{"para_id":44,"paragraph":"Section Second.

A few, though distinct traces of Roman forts or camps, as at Ambleside, and upon Dunmallet, and few circles of rude stones attributed to the Druids, are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country, of these ancient occupants; and, as the Saxons and Danes, who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the Britons, seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country,-- we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the Normans, when their feudal polity was regularly established. We may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides, choaked up as they must have been with wood, lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the Island, and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom, could have little attraction for the high-born and powerful; especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence, sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks, which, in the then rude state of military knowledge, could be made upon them. Accordingly, the more retired regions( and to such I am now confining myself) must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them, and left, doubtless, partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers, and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders. Hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur, castles, or monastic edifices, which are only found upon the skirts of the country, as Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, the Priory of Lannercost, Gleaston Castle,-- long ago a residence of the Flemings,-- and the numerous ancient castles of the Cliffords, the Lucys, and the Dacres.

We will, therefore, give a sketch of the economy of the Abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants, as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other Lords, and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day, being, in fact, one of the principle causes which give it such a striking superiority, in beauty and interest, over all other parts of the island.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Great Britain",29,42],["Ambleside",309,318],["Dunmallet",329,338],["Furness Abbey",1897,1910],["Calder Abbey",1912,1924],["Furness",2176,2183]],"geonouns":[["mountain",72,80],["districts",190,199],["stones",364,370],["country",455,462],["villages",561,569],["hamlets",574,581],["dales",862,867],["mountain",872,880],["wood",927,931],["edge",1016,1020],["country",1145,1152],["castles",1177,1184],["houses",1189,1195],["regions",1365,1372],["lakes",1736,1741],["castles",1810,1817],["country",1885,1892],["residence",1982,1991],["castles",2036,2043],["mountains",2119,2128],["lands",2460,2465],["country",2597,2604],["island",2775,2781]],"pos_words":[["well",50,54],["protection",104,114],["accessible",162,172],["fertile",182,189],["succeeded",526,535],["attraction",1061,1071],["powerful",1094,1102],["sufficient",1208,1218],["doubtless",1534,1543],["grandeur",1800,1808],["doubtless",2509,2518],["striking",2701,2709],["superiority",2710,2721],["beauty",2726,2732]],"neg_words":[["invader",239,246],["rude",359,363],["vestiges",410,418],["confined",647,655],["lying",933,938],["hostile",1026,1033],["repel",1222,1227],["attacks",1248,1255],["rude",1276,1280],["neglected",1428,1437],["shunned",1441,1448],["hostile",2357,2364]],"events":[],"dates":[["the present day",2619,2634]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",1528,1532]],"spa_preps":[["out",939,942],["over",1513,1517],["out",1617,1620],["among",2466,2471],["over",2747,2751]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0087336245,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9952747822},{"para_id":54,"paragraph":"\" When the Abbots of Furness,\" says an author before cited,\" enfranchised their villains, and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants, the lands, which they had cultivated for their lord, were divided into whole tenements; each of which, besides the customary annual rent, was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders, or elsewhere: each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts; each villain had one; and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man at arms, and of other burdens.

The enfranchised shepherd, or woodlander, having chosen there his place of residence, builds it of sods, or of the mountain stone, and, with the permission of his lord, encloses, like Robinson Crusoe, a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect. Others are happy to imitate his example, and avail themselves of the same privileges; and thus a population, mainly of Danish or Norse origin, as the dialect indicates, crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies. Chapels, daughters of some distant mother church, are first erected in the more open and fertile vales, as those of Bowness and Grasmere, offsets of Kendal; which again, after a period, as the settled population increases, become mother-churches to smaller edifices, planted, at length, in almost every dale throughout the country. The enclosures, formed by the tenantry, are for a long time confined to the home-steads; and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field; the several portions being marked out by stones, bushes, or trees; which portions, where the custom has survived, to this day are called dales from the word deylen, to distribute; but, while the valley was thus lying open, enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains; because the land there was not intermixed, and was of little comparative value; and, therefore, small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous. Hence, the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit, intersected, as they are, almost to the summit, with stone walls, of which the fences are always formed. When first erected, they must have little disfigured the face of the country; as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining; and the lines would also be broken( as they still are) by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course. In the meadows, and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained, and could not afford a stable foundation, there, when the increasing value of land, and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field, had induced each inhabitant to inclose his own, they were compelled to make the fences of alders, willows, and other trees. These, where the native wood had disappeared, have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylan appearance; while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity, which, where large properties are prevalent, and large capitals employed in agri-culture, is unknown. This sylvan appearance is still further heightened by the number of ash-trees planted in rows along the quick fences, and along the walls, for the purpose of browzing cattle at the approach of winter. The branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures; and, when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves, they are used for repairing hedges, or for fuel.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Bowness",882,889],["Grasmere",894,902],["Kendal",915,921]],"geonouns":[["mountains",198,207],["residence",327,336],["mountain",367,375],["stone",376,381],["door",493,497],["church",808,814],["vales",863,868],["churches",1003,1011],["dale",1069,1073],["country",1089,1096],["meadow",1206,1212],["land",1213,1217],["vales",1225,1230],["common",1247,1253],["field",1254,1259],["stones",1302,1308],["trees",1321,1326],["dales",1398,1403],["valley",1456,1462],["mountains",1542,1551],["land",1565,1569],["mountains",1819,1828],["summit",1878,1884],["stone",1891,1896],["walls",1897,1902],["country",2012,2019],["lines",2036,2041],["wood",2096,2100],["lines",2125,2130],["rocks",2179,2184],["meadows",2231,2238],["grounds",2272,2279],["land",2408,2412],["ground",2470,2476],["common",2480,2486],["field",2487,2492],["trees",2611,2616],["wood",2642,2646],["trees",2994,2999],["walls",3054,3059]],"pos_words":[["desirable",8,17],["like",431,435],["protect",531,538],["happy",551,556],["fertile",855,862],["sufficiently",2308,2320],["afford",2344,2350],["stable",2353,2359],["intricate",2736,2745],["graceful",2797,2805]],"neg_words":[["crept",709,714],["confined",1158,1166],["lying",1472,1477],["opposition",1655,1665],["broken",2145,2151],["interrupt",2191,2200],["drained",2321,2328],["inconvenience",2422,2435],["suffered",2436,2444],["irregularity",2806,2818],["unknown",2913,2920]],"events":[],"dates":[["this day",1378,1386],["winter",3115,3121]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",308,313],["throughout",1074,1084],["home",1174,1178],["there",1570,1575],["there",2372,2377]],"spa_preps":[["among",144,149],["out",1295,1298],["along",3016,3021],["along",3044,3049]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0037174721,"vader_sentiment":-0.01,"roberta_sentiment":0.9887472987},{"para_id":57,"paragraph":"We have thus seen a numerous body of Dalesmen creeping into possession of their home-steads, their little crofts, their mountain-enclosures; and, finally, the whole vale is visibly divided; except, perhaps, here and there some marshy ground, which, till fully drained, would not repay the trouble of enclosing. But these last partitions do not seem to have been general, till long after the pacification of the Borders, by the union of the two crowns; when the cause, which had first determined the distribution of the land in such small parcels, had not only ceased,-- but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country, with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce.

Accordingly, in Queen Elizabeth's time, this was so strongly felt, that a petition was made to the Crown, praying\" that the Blomaries in high Furness might be abolished, on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines, to the great detriment of the cattle.\" But this same cause, about a hundred years later, produced effects directly contrary to those which have been deprecated. The re-establishment, at that period, of furnaces upon a large scale, made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the inclosures, sprinkled over with remains of the native forest, into close woods, which, when cattle and sheep were excluded, rapidly sowed and thickened themselves.

As these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances, they have received additions and accomodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy; so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature, and may( using a strong expression) rather be said to have grown rather than to have been erected;-- to have risen, by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock-- so little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty! Among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs, are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance, that the strong winds, which sweep down the vallies, induced the inhabitants, at a time when the materials for buildings were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence, are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds. Nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney. Others are of a quadrangular shape, rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is often surmounted by a top cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form, and the living column of smoke, through the still air ascending from it. These dwellings, mostly built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with slates, which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood, and are, therefore, rough and uneven in their surfaces, so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished pieces of rest of the seeds of lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which, in their very form call to mind the processes of nature, do thus, clothed with this vegetable garb, appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity, along which the humbled-minded inhabitants have thruogh so many generations been led. Add the little garden with its shed for bee-hives, its small beds of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-press, often supported by some tree near the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall Scotch fir, through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless; the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons;-- combine these incidents and images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain-cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself, and so richly adorned by the hand of nature.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["houses",13,19],["rock",99,103],["house",169,174],["houses",407,413],["walls",1118,1123],["buildings",1384,1393],["cottage",2012,2019],["stone",2346,2351],["quarry",2410,2416],["houses",2574,2580],["buildings",2670,2679],["woods",2892,2897],["fields",2902,2908],["beds",3177,3181],["tree",3386,3390],["door",3400,3404],["trees",3522,3527],["mountain",3692,3700],["cottage",3701,3708],["country",3717,3724]],"pos_words":[["distinguished",184,197],["liberty",695,702],["fancy",721,726],["humble",742,748],["strong",838,844],["beauty",1059,1065],["harmonious",1186,1196],["strong",1282,1288],["beauty",1617,1623],["attentive",1662,1671],["supported",1769,1778],["top",1984,1987],["beautiful",2037,2046],["refined",2110,2117],["pleasing",2145,2153],["harmony",2154,2161],["tranquil",2988,2996],["led",3111,3114],["supported",3368,3377],["beautifully",3728,3739],["richly",3765,3771]],"neg_words":[["rough",224,229],["hasty",285,290],["sober",376,381],["smoke",1843,1848],["fanciful",2098,2106],["smoke",2233,2238],["rough",2333,2338],["splitting",2443,2452],["rough",2494,2499],["uneven",2504,2510]],"events":[],"dates":[["a few years",310,321],["Sunday",3239,3245],["summer",3444,3450]],"times":[],"distances":[["one or two feet",1910,1925]],"loc_advs":[["there",1004,1009],["there",2134,2139],["near",3391,3395]],"spa_preps":[["out",105,108],["out",966,969],["down",1308,1312],["over",1572,1576],["down",1849,1853],["above",1926,1931],["between",2162,2169],["through",2240,2247],["into",2810,2814],["among",2882,2887],["along",3030,3035],["through",3482,3489],["together",3640,3648]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0357142857,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9971497655},{"para_id":65,"paragraph":"Till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage-roads; all bulky articles were transported on pack-horses.

One cannot but regret that parish registers so seldom contain any thing but bare names; in a few of this country, especially in that of Loweswater, I have found interesting notices of unusual natural occurrences-- characters of the deceased, and particulars of their lives.

Persons, who in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire would probably have built a modest dwelling like those of their sensible neighbours, have been turned out of their course; and, acting in part, no wonder if, having had little experience, they act it ill. The craving for prospect, also, which is immoderate, particularly in new settlers, has rendered it impossible that buildings, whatever might have been their architecture, should in most instances be ornamental to the landscape; rising as they do from the summits of naked hills in staring contrast to the snugness and privacy of the ancient houses.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Leicestershire",629,643]],"geonouns":[["country",29,36],["common",96,102],["buildings",288,297],["country",377,384],["house",434,439],["buildings",984,993],["landscape",1086,1095],["summits",1124,1131],["hills",1141,1146],["houses",1210,1216]],"pos_words":[["admiration",412,422],["affectation",600,611],["modest",692,698],["like",708,712],["sensible",728,736],["wonder",811,817]],"neg_words":[["bad",182,185],["object",394,400],["censure",504,511],["immoderate",910,920],["impossible",968,978]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["out",766,769]],"normalised_sentiment":0.01,"vader_sentiment":0.32,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9857332706},{"para_id":80,"paragraph":"No man is to be condemned for a desire to decorate his residence and possessions; feeling a disposition to applaud such an endeavour, I would show how the end may be best attained.

Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say,\" if you would fix upon the best colour for your house, turn up a stone, or pluck up a handful of grass by the roots, and see what the colour of the soil where your house is to stand, and let that be your choice.\" Of course, this precept, given in conversation, could not have been meant to be taken literally. For example, in Low Furness, where the soil, from its strong impregnation with iron, is universally of a deep red, if this rule were strictly followed, the house also must be of a glaring red; in other places it must be of a sullen black; which would only be adding annoyance to annoyance. The rule, however, as a general guide, is good; and, in agricultural districts, where large tracts of soil are laid bare by the plough, particularly if( the face of the country being undulating) they are held up to view, this rule, though not to be implicitly adhered to, should never be lost sight of;-- the colour of the house ought, if possible, to have a cast or shade of the colour of the soil. The principle is, that the house must harmonise with the surrounding landscape: accordingly, in mountainous countries, with still more confidence may it be said,\" look at the rocks and those parts of the mountains where the soil is visible, and they will furnish a safe direction.\" Nevertheless, it will often happen that the rocks may bear so large a proportion to the rest of the landscape, and may be of such a tone of colour, that the rule may not admit, even here, of being implicitly followed. For instance, the chief defect in the colouring of the Country of the Lakes( which is most strongly felt in the summer season) is an over-prevalence of a bluish tint, which the green of the herbage, the fern, and the woods, does not sufficiently counteract. If a house, therefore, should stand where this defect prevails, I have no hesitation in saying, that the colour of the neighbouring rocks would not be the best that could be chosen. A tint ought to be introduced approaching nearer to those which, in technical language of painters, are called warm: this, if happily selected, would not disturb but would animate the landscape. How often do we see this exemplified upon a small scale by the native cottages, in cases where the glare of the white-wash has been subdued by time and enriched by weather-stains! No harshness is then seen; but one of these cottages, thus coloured, will often form a central point to a landscape by which the whole shall be connected, and an influence of pleasure diffused over all the objects that compose the picture. But where the cold blue tint of the rocks is enriched by the iron tinge, the colour cannot be too closely be imitated; and it will be produced of itself by the stones hewn from the adjoining quarry, and by the mortar, which may be tempered with the most gravelly part of the soil. The pure blue gravel, from the bed of the river, is, however, more suitable to the mason's purpose, who will probably insist also that the house must be covered with rough-cast, otherwise it cannot be kept dry; if this advice be taken, the builder of taste will set about contriving such means as may enable him to come the nearest to the effect aimed at.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Furness",643,650],["Lakes",1883,1888]],"geonouns":[["house",89,94],["house",361,366],["stone",378,383],["house",477,482],["house",779,784],["districts",982,991],["country",1082,1089],["house",1236,1241],["house",1340,1345],["landscape",1382,1391],["countries",1421,1430],["rocks",1488,1493],["mountains",1517,1526],["rocks",1639,1644],["landscape",1695,1704],["woods",2030,2035],["house",2076,2081],["rocks",2203,2208],["landscape",2437,2446],["cottages",2518,2526],["cottages",2672,2680],["point",2723,2728],["landscape",2734,2743],["rocks",2904,2909],["stones",3028,3034],["quarry",3059,3065],["bed",3180,3183],["river",3191,3196],["house",3288,3293]],"pos_words":[["best",340,344],["strong",677,683],["good",955,959],["confidence",1448,1458],["safe",1578,1582],["sufficiently",2046,2058],["best",2226,2230],["warm",2364,2368],["happily",2379,2386],["pleasure",2803,2811],["pure",3153,3157],["suitable",3216,3224]],"neg_words":[["strictly",756,764],["sullen",848,854],["annoyance",889,898],["annoyance",902,911],["lost",1201,1205],["defect",1837,1843],["defect",2118,2124],["disturb",2407,2414],["glare",2547,2552],["subdued",2580,2587],["stains",2620,2626],["cold",2882,2886],["rough",3315,3320]],"events":[],"dates":[["the summer season",1921,1938]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",1777,1781]],"spa_preps":[["into",217,221],["over",1946,1950],["over",2821,2825],["about",3415,3420]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0033444816,"vader_sentiment":0.91,"roberta_sentiment":0.9901769757},{"para_id":89,"paragraph":"The supposed necessity of rough-cast to keep out rain in houses not built of hewn stone or brick, has tended greatly to injure English landscape, and the neighbourhood of these Lakes especially, by furnishing such apt occasion for whitening buildings. That white should be a favourite colour for rural residences is natural for many reasons. The mere aspect of cleanliness and neatness thus given, not only to an individual house, but, where the practice is general, to the whole face of the country, produces moral associations so powerful, that, in many minds, they take place of all others. But what has already been said upon the subject of cottages, must have convinced men of feeling and imagination, that a human habitation of the humblest class may be rendered more deeply interesting to the affections, and far more pleasing to the eye, by other influences than a sprightly tone of colour spread over its outside. I do not, however, mean to deny, that a small white building, embowered in trees, may, in some situations, be a delightful and animating object-- in no way injurious to the landscape; but this only, where it sparkles from the midst of a thick shade, and in rare and solitary instances; especially if the country be itself rich, and pleasing, and abound with grand forms. On the sides of the bleak and desolate moors, we are indeed thankful for the site of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered, where, without these, perhaps everything would be cheerless: this is said, however, with hesitation, and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments. But I have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sunrise, and in wandering lights, with no common pleasure. The continental traveller also will remember, that the convents hanging from the rocks of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, or among the Appenines or the mountains of Spain, are not looked at with less complacency when, as is often the case, they happen to be of a brilliant white. But this is perhaps owing, in no small degree, to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life, and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance, in those countries.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",177,182],["Rhone",1809,1814],["Appenines",1841,1850],["Spain",1871,1876]],"geonouns":[["houses",57,63],["stone",82,87],["landscape",135,144],["buildings",241,250],["residences",302,312],["mere",346,350],["house",424,429],["country",492,499],["cottages",645,653],["building",975,983],["trees",998,1003],["landscape",1096,1105],["country",1227,1234],["moors",1333,1338],["cottages",1385,1393],["houses",1404,1410],["buildings",1621,1630],["common",1687,1693],["rocks",1785,1790],["mountains",1858,1867],["residences",2137,2147],["countries",2195,2204]],"pos_words":[["cleanliness",361,372],["powerful",532,540],["interesting",781,792],["pleasing",825,833],["sprightly",873,882],["delightful",1035,1045],["rich",1245,1249],["pleasing",1255,1263],["abound",1269,1275],["grand",1281,1286],["thankful",1354,1362],["pleasure",1694,1702],["brilliant",1969,1978],["lively",2057,2063],["smiling",2151,2158],["attractive",2163,2173]],"neg_words":[["rough",26,31],["injure",120,126],["deny",950,954],["injurious",1079,1088],["bleak",1314,1319],["desolate",1324,1332],["cheerless",1484,1493],["gloom",2080,2085]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["outside",914,921],["without",1441,1448]],"spa_preps":[["out",45,48],["over",905,909],["among",1831,1836]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0430107527,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9929058552},{"para_id":90,"paragraph":"The objections to white, as a colour, in large spots or masses in landscapes, especially in mountainous country, are insurmountable. In nature, pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as the clouds, foam of rivers, and snow. Mr Gilpin, who notices this, has also recorded the just remark of Mr. Locke, of N--, that white destroys the gradations of distance; and, therefore, an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape-painting. Five or six white houses, scattered over a valley, by their obtrusiveness, dot the surface, and divide it into triangles, or other mathermatical figures, haunting the eye, and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect. I have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain; cutting away, by a harsh separation, the whole of its base, below the point on which the house stood. Thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced, not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination, which will give more than the eye loses; but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible; and the mountain appeared to take its beginning, or to rise from the line of the house, instead of its own natural base. But, if I may express my own individual feeling, it is after sunset, at the coming on of twilight, that white objects are most to be complained of. The solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred, and often destroyed by them. When the ground is covered by snow, they are of course inoffensive; and in moonshine they are always pleasing-- it is a tone of light with which they accord; and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful. I will conclude this subject with noticing, that the cold, slaty colour, which many persons, who have heard the white condemned, have adopted in its stead, must be disapproved of for the reason already given. The flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme, and is still more censurable. Upon the whole, the safety colour, for general use, is something between a cream and a dust-colour, commonly called stone-colour;-- there are, among the Lakes, examples of this that need not be pointed out.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",2244,2249]],"geonouns":[["landscapes",66,76],["country",104,111],["rivers",274,280],["landscape",514,523],["houses",552,558],["valley",577,583],["house",794,799],["mountain",835,843],["point",915,920],["house",934,939],["mountain",981,989],["mountain",1194,1202],["line",1255,1259],["house",1267,1272],["ground",1563,1569],["stone",2207,2212]],"pos_words":[["pure",144,148],["pure",454,458],["good",499,503],["perfect",758,765],["majesty",822,829],["cheerful",1791,1799]],"neg_words":[["objections",4,14],["insurmountable",117,131],["scarcely",158,166],["object",444,450],["scarcely",469,477],["haunting",688,696],["disturbing",710,720],["impair",811,817],["harsh",864,869],["object",1035,1041],["loses",1119,1124],["complained",1440,1450],["object",1760,1766],["conspicuous",1775,1786],["cold",1854,1858],["condemned",1919,1928],["dust",2178,2182]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",1172,1176],["there",2223,2228]],"spa_preps":[["over",570,574],["into",640,644],["away",853,857],["below",905,910],["into",2034,2038],["opposite",2043,2051],["between",2156,2163],["among",2234,2239],["out",2293,2296]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0567010309,"vader_sentiment":-0.92,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9976181388},{"para_id":91,"paragraph":"The principle taken as our guide, viz. that the house should be so formed, and of such apparent size and colour, as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the scenery of nature, should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations, and is here more urgently needed; for it is from abuses in this department, far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture( if the phrase may be used) that this country has suffered. Larch and fir plantations have been spread, nor merely with a view to profit, but in many instances for the sake of ornament. To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite, the larch, I would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory, when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors, and in other parts of the Island, which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate. And I will also beg leave to represent to them, that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree; because in rich soils and sheltered situations, the wood, though it thrives fast, is full of sap, and of little value; and is, likewise, very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects, and from blight. Accordingly, in Scotland, where planting is much better understood, and carried on upon an imcomparably larger scale than among us, good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak, the ash, and other deciduous trees; and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground. There the plant, which is a hardy one, is of slower growth; much less liable to injury; and the timber is of better quality. But the circumstances of many permit, and their taste leads them, to plant with little regard to profit; and there are others, less wealthy, who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes, that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it. Both these classes of persons, I would entreat to enquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists. They would then se that, after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs, which, from the circumstance of their not being native, may, by their very looks, remind us that they owe their existence to our hands, and their prosperity to our care; they will see that, after this material desire has been provided for, the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place. Before I proceed, I will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them, that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency, when they are so eager to change the face of that country, whose native attractions, by the act of erecting their habitations in it, they have so emphatically acknowledged. And surely there is not a single spot that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity to support itself, unaided by the productions of other climates, or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Scotland",1375,1383]],"geonouns":[["house",48,53],["grounds",234,241],["country",441,448],["tree",650,654],["vales",788,793],["land",874,878],["moors",899,904],["tree",1147,1151],["wood",1205,1209],["trees",1584,1589],["ground",1653,1659],["country",2843,2850]],"pos_words":[["lovely",781,787],["cheaper",992,999],["flattering",1096,1106],["promises",1107,1115],["speedy",1125,1131],["rich",1164,1168],["fast",1229,1233],["better",1408,1414],["good",1491,1495],["hardy",1689,1694],["better",1770,1776],["leads",1840,1845],["regard",1873,1879],["wealthy",1918,1925],["lively",1943,1949],["beauty",1972,1978],["laudably",2010,2018],["beauty",2158,2164],["admire",2176,2182],["gratified",2245,2254],["prosperity",2472,2482],["satisfied",2692,2701],["eager",2810,2815],["well",3028,3032],["sufficient",3042,3052],["dignity",3053,3060],["support",3064,3071]],"neg_words":[["abuses",308,314],["suffered",453,461],["regret",737,743],["barren",849,855],["beg",1022,1025],["sap",1246,1249],["ravage",1306,1312],["attacks",1322,1329],["confined",1622,1630],["barren",1634,1640],["slower",1706,1712],["liable",1731,1737],["injury",1741,1747],["unwilling",2023,2032],["liable",2756,2762],["inconsistency",2778,2791],["emphatically",2939,2951]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",266,270],["there",832,837],["away",1088,1092],["there",1895,1900],["there",2977,2982],["elsewhere",3178,3187]],"spa_preps":[["out",655,658],["among",1481,1486],["round",2281,2286],["beyond",2584,2590]],"normalised_sentiment":0.04048583,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9941026568},{"para_id":92,"paragraph":"Having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants, provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house, we may add, that a transition should be contrived without abruptness, from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs, which ought to be of the kinds scattered by Nature through the woods-- holly, broom, wild-rose, elder, dogberry, white and black thorn,&amp; c. either these only, or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their uniting in form, and harmonising in colour with them, especially with respect to colour, when the tints are most diversified, as in autumn and spring. The various sorts of fruit-and-blossom-bearing trees usually found in orchards, to which may be added those of the woods,-- namely, the wilding, black cherry tree, and wild cluster-cherry( here called heck-berry) may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees; which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country. Of the birch, one of the most beautiful of the native trees, it may be noticed, that, in dry and rocky situations, it outstrips even the larch, which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth. Sycamore, and the Scotch fir( which, when it has room to spread out it arms, is a noble tree) may be placed with advantage near the house; for, from their massiveness, they unite well with buildings, and in some situations with rocks also; having, in their forms and apparent substances, the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone, and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees. If these general rules be just, what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents, with their own wild wood in sight-- where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together-- colour at war with colour, and form with form-- among the most peaceful subjects of Nature's kingdom every where in discord, distraction, and bewilderment! But this deformity, bad as it is, is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are over-running the hill-sides. To justify our condemnation of these, let us again recur to Nature. The process, by which she forms woods and forests, is as follows. Seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds, brought by waters, and dropped by birds. They perish, or produce, according to the soil and situation upon which they fall are situated to them; and under the same dependence, the seedling or sucker, if not cropped by animals, thrives, and the tree grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours. From low and sheltered places, vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed; and the young plants are protected, and to a certain degree fashioned, by those that have preceded them. The continous mass of foliage which would be thus produced, is broken by rocks, or by glades or open places, where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of the wood. As vegetation ascends, the wind begins also to bear their part in the moulding the forms of the trees; but, thus mutually protected, trees, though not of the hardiest kind, are enabled to climb high up the mountains. Gradually, however, by the quality of the ground, and by increasing exposure, a stop is put to their ascent; the hardy trees only are left; those also, by little and little, give way,-- and a wild and irregular boundary is established, graceful in its outline, and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["doors",126,131],["house",139,144],["trees",684,689],["tree",795,799],["forest",925,931],["trees",932,937],["country",1005,1012],["trees",1068,1073],["tree",1332,1336],["house",1376,1381],["buildings",1433,1442],["rocks",1472,1477],["stone",1612,1617],["trees",1660,1665],["trees",1767,1772],["rocks",1779,1784],["wood",1827,1831],["hill",2220,2224],["woods",2332,2337],["forests",2342,2349],["waters",2424,2430],["tree",2657,2661],["rocks",3082,3087],["wood",3180,3184],["trees",3282,3287],["trees",3319,3324],["mountains",3392,3401],["ground",3445,3451],["trees",3522,3527]],"pos_words":[["respect",556,563],["diversified",599,610],["blossom",668,675],["happily",857,864],["beautiful",1044,1053],["noble",1326,1331],["advantage",1357,1366],["well",1423,1427],["lighter",1652,1659],["dashing",1789,1796],["peaceful",1988,1996],["hardy",3516,3521],["graceful",3639,3647]],"neg_words":[["confined",103,111],["contrived",186,195],["wild",350,354],["wild",805,809],["heck",838,842],["rocky",1111,1116],["wild",1822,1826],["discord",2041,2048],["distraction",2050,2061],["bewilderment",2067,2079],["bad",2101,2104],["obtrusive",2125,2134],["condemnation",2247,2259],["indiscriminately",2386,2402],["perish",2459,2465],["fall",2531,2535],["sucker",2605,2611],["broken",3072,3078],["wild",3595,3599],["irregular",3604,3613]],"events":[["woods--",328,335]],"dates":[["autumn",618,624],["spring",629,635]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",196,203],["here",826,830],["between",898,905],["without",2708,2715],["upwards",2875,2882],["left",3537,3541],["without",3687,3694]],"spa_preps":[["through",316,323],["out",1308,1311],["near",1367,1371],["among",1773,1778],["among",1973,1978],["over",2203,2207],["under",2562,2567]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0215384615,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9935945868},{"para_id":93,"paragraph":"Contrast the liberty that encourages, and the law that limits, this joint work of nature and time, with the disheartening necessities, restrictions, and disadvantages, under which the artificial planter must proceed, even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task.

In spring the large becomes green long before the native trees; and its green long before the native trees; and its green is so peculiar and vivid that, finding nothing to harmonize with it, wherever it comes forth, a disagreeable speck is produced. In summer, when all other trees are in their pride, it is of a dingy lifeless hue; in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow, and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest, for they seem only to sleep, but the larch appears absolutely dead. If an attempt be made to mingle thickets, or a certain proportion of other forest-trees, with the larch, its horizontal branches intolerably cut them down as a scythe, or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it. The terminating spike, renders it impossible, that the several trees, where planted in numbers, should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood. Add thousands to tens of thousands, and the appearance is still the same-- a collection of separate individual trees, obstinately presenting themselves as such; and which, from whatever point they are looked at, if but seen, may be counted upon fingers. Sunshine, or shadow, has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood; and the trees not carrying up their their heads, the wind raises among them no magical undulations. It is indeed true, that, in countries where the larch is a native, and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley, and from hill to hill, a sublime image may be produced such a forest, in the same manner as by one composec of any other single tree, to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned. For sublimity will never be wanting, where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in, and alternates with, that of intense unity; and to the ready perception of this effect, similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute.

The family of each man, whether estatesman or farmer, formerly had a twofold support; first, the produce of his lands and flocks; and secondly, the profit drawn from the employment of women and children, as manufacturers; spinning their own wool in their own houses( work chiefly done in the winter season) and carrying it to market for sale. Hence, however numerous the children, the income of the family kept pace with its increase. But, by the invention and universal application of machinery, this second resource has been cut off; the gains being so far reduced, as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment. Doubtless, the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss; for the profits arising from home-manufacturers operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry. They also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of produce of land, brought about by the establishment of manufactories, and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry. But this is far from making them amends; and now that home-manufacturers are nearly done away, women and children might, at many seasons of the year, employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do, yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined, and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital. The consequence, then, is-- that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms, several are united in one, and the buildings go to decay, or are destroyed; and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them, they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers, who in like manner unite and consolidate; and, if they wish to become residents, erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages, whose little enclosures, with all the wild graces that grew out of them, disappear. The feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers; but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured; and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the Lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of Gentry, either strangers or natives. It is then much to be wished, that a better taste should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which, without design and unconsciously, their humble predecessors have moved. In this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole Island, who, by their visits( often repeated) to the Lakes in the North of England, testify that they deem the district a sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",3049,3054],["Lakes",3492,3497],["England",3514,3521]],"geonouns":[["district",103,111],["country",325,332],["house",671,676],["lands",790,795],["houses",937,943],["market",1004,1010],["island",1600,1606],["land",1658,1662],["fields",1966,1972],["farms",2322,2327],["buildings",2364,2373],["lands",2418,2423],["mansions",2643,2651],["cottages",2684,2692],["country",3020,3027],["path",3239,3243],["district",3550,3558]],"pos_words":[["beauty",77,83],["delightful",92,102],["support",755,762],["work",945,949],["gains",1218,1223],["pure",1399,1403],["strong",1472,1478],["benefit",1582,1589],["advantage",1949,1958],["wealthy",2532,2539],["like",2559,2563],["strong",2908,2914],["better",3178,3184],["beauty",3262,3268],["humble",3322,3328],["pure",3407,3411],["right",3613,3618],["enjoy",3674,3679]],"neg_words":[["inevitably",166,176],["difficulty",376,386],["unfortunate",471,482],["disabled",1298,1306],["loss",1404,1408],["temptation",1479,1489],["neglect",1523,1530],["confined",2134,2142],["decay",2380,2385],["fall",2509,2513],["ruins",2663,2668],["wild",2732,2736],["galling",2945,2952],["fall",3060,3064],["unnecessary",3206,3217]],"events":[],"dates":[["the winter season",966,983],["many seasons of the year",1900,1924],["a few years",3004,3015]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["home",1439,1443],["home",1830,1834],["away",1865,1869],["beyond",1973,1979],["above",2148,2153],["there",2164,2169],["without",3282,3289],["throughout",3418,3428]],"spa_preps":[["about",1672,1677],["into",2514,2518],["out",2652,2655],["out",2754,2757],["under",2796,2801],["into",3081,3085],["along",3269,3274]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0100334448,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984363914},{"para_id":100,"paragraph":"Miscellaneous Observations.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9900342822},{"para_id":101,"paragraph":"Mr. West, in his well-known Guide to the Lakes, recommends, as the best season for visiting this country, the interval from the beginning of June to the end of August; and, the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure, it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither. But that season is by no means the best; the colouring of the mountains and woods, unless where they are diversified by rocks, is of too unvaried a green, as a large portion of the Vallies is allotted to hay-grass, some want of variety is found there also. The meadows, however, are sufficiently enlivened after hay-making begins, which is much later than in the southern part of the Island. A stonger objection is rainy weather, setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour, and continuing with a perseverance, that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain, which fall among the Abyssinian Mountains for the annual supply of the Nile. The months of September and October( particularly October) are generally attended with much finer weather; and the scenery is the, beyond comparison, more diversified, more splendid, and beautiful; but, on the other hand, short days prevent long excursions, and sharp and chill gales an unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors. Nevertheless, to the sincere admirer of Nature, who is in good health and spirits, and at liberty to make a choice, the six weeks following the 1st of September may be recommended in preference to July and August. For there is no inconveniece arising from the season which, to such a person, would not be amply recompensed by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired Vallies, into which discordant plantation, and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance. -- In such spots, at this season, there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour, through the whole scale of objects;-- in the tender green of the after-grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock, crowned by shrubs and trees; in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble-fields in the manner broken; in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours; in the calm blue Lakes and River Pools; and in the foliage of the trees, through all the tints of Autumn, from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash, to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder, and of the ivy upon the rocks, upon the trees, and the cottages. Yet, as most travellers are either stinted, or stine themselves, for time, I would recommend the space between the middle or last week in May and the middle or last week of June, as affording best combination of long days, fine weather, and variety of impressions. Few of the native trees are then in full leaf; but, for whatever may be wanting in depth of shade, more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage, in the blossoms of the fruit-and-berry-bearing trees which abound in the woods, and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs, with which many of the copses are interveined. In those woods, also, and on those mountain-sides which have a northern aspect, and in the deep dells, many of the spring-flowers still linger; while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of approaching summer. And, besides, is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of Linnets and Thrushes chaunting their love-songs in the copses, woods, and hedgerows, of a mountainous country; safe from the birds of prey, which build in the inaccessible crags, and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air? The number of those formidable creatures is probably the cause why, in the narrow vallies, there are no Sky Larks; as the Destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags, before they could descend to their ground-nests for protection. It is not often that Nightningales resort to these Vales; but almost all the other tribes of our English warblers are numerous; and their notes, when listened to by the side of broad still waters, or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain-brooks, have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly. There is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the Cuckoo, when the voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley, very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a falat country. Nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of Spring especially interesting; I mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds. The herbage being thus cropped as it springs, that would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight, is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks; while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about. These sportive creatures, as they gather strength, are turned out upon the open mountains, and with their slender limbs, their snow-white colour, and their wild and light motions, beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns, upon which they must now begin to seek their food. And last, but not least, at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation, even in the smaller inns. I am aware that few of those, who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so, as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind is mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice. It will therefore be more pleasant to observe, that, though the months of July and August are liable to many objections, yet it often happens that the weather, at this time, is not more wet and stormy than they, who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of Nature of their utmost sublimity, would desire. For no Traveller, provided he be in good health and with any command of time, would have a just privilege to visit such scenes, if he could grudge the price of a little confinement among them or interruption of his journey for the sight or sound of a storm coming on or clearing away. Insensible must be he who would not congratulate himself upon the bold bursts of sunshine, the descending vapours, wandering lights and shadows, and the invigorated torrents and water-falls, with which broken weather, in a mountainous region, is accompanied. At such time there is no cause to complain, either of the monotony of midsummer colouring or the glaring atmosphere of long, cloudless, and hot days.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",41,46],["Lakes",2226,2231],["River",2236,2241]],"geonouns":[["country",97,104],["mountains",359,368],["woods",373,378],["rocks",417,422],["meadows",558,565],["fall",902,906],["doors",1303,1308],["buildings",1745,1754],["entrance",1774,1782],["meadows",1979,1986],["islands",2005,2012],["rock",2030,2034],["trees",2058,2063],["fields",2121,2127],["mountain",2157,2165],["trees",2275,2280],["rocks",2445,2450],["trees",2461,2466],["cottages",2476,2484],["trees",2769,2774],["trees",2964,2969],["woods",2990,2995],["woods",3110,3115],["mountain",3136,3144],["dells",3197,3202],["woods",3488,3493],["country",3527,3534],["crags",3597,3602],["crags",3863,3868],["ground",3905,3911],["waters",4123,4129],["mountain",4177,4185],["brooks",4186,4192],["mountain",4361,4369],["valley",4370,4376],["country",4458,4465],["mountains",4620,4629],["grounds",4666,4673],["meadows",4817,4824],["mountains",5009,5018],["rocks",5149,5154],["lawns",5159,5164],["inns",5341,5345],["water",6364,6369],["region",6421,6427]],"pos_words":[["well-known",17,27],["best",67,71],["best",332,336],["diversified",402,413],["variety",525,532],["sufficiently",580,592],["perseverance",800,812],["finer",1065,1070],["diversified",1128,1139],["splendid",1146,1154],["beautiful",1160,1169],["sharp",1235,1240],["pleasure",1287,1295],["sincere",1331,1338],["admirer",1339,1346],["good",1368,1372],["liberty",1400,1407],["recommended",1478,1489],["amply",1615,1620],["admirable",1830,1839],["harmony",1874,1881],["tender",1938,1944],["glowing",2172,2179],["calm",2216,2220],["brilliant",2333,2342],["recommend",2569,2578],["best",2678,2682],["fine",2709,2713],["variety",2727,2734],["abound",2976,2982],["golden",3008,3014],["exquisite",3353,3362],["pleasure",3363,3371],["love",3462,3466],["safe",3536,3540],["formidable",3686,3696],["protection",3922,3932],["imaginative",4265,4276],["excited",4421,4428],["interesting",4552,4563],["beautifully",5109,5120],["comfortable",5294,5305],["recommendation",5415,5429],["freedom",5566,5573],["pleasant",5611,5619],["capable",5812,5819],["enjoying",5823,5831],["sublime",5836,5843],["good",5937,5941],["privilege",5997,6006],["congratulate",6222,6234],["hot",6585,6588]],"neg_words":[["objection",699,708],["disappointed",834,846],["dejected",851,859],["chill",1245,1250],["discordant",1707,1717],["irregular",2072,2081],["broken",2142,2148],["pale",2324,2328],["wild",5085,5089],["liable",5679,5685],["objections",5694,5704],["stormy",5779,5785],["grudge",6041,6047],["interruption",6096,6108],["falls",6370,6375],["broken",6388,6394],["complain",6479,6487],["monotony",6503,6511]],"events":[],"dates":[["season",72,78],["the beginning of June to the end of August",124,166],["two latter months",177,194],["that season",301,312],["annual",946,952],["The months of September and October",973,1008],["October",1023,1030],["days",1201,1205],["the six weeks",1426,1439],["the 1st of September",1450,1470],["July",1507,1511],["August",1516,1522],["the season",1566,1576],["this season",1805,1816],["Autumn",2307,2313],["the middle or last week",2597,2620],["May",2624,2627],["the middle or last week of June",2632,2663],["days",2703,2707],["the spring",3212,3222],["summer",3321,3327],["Spring",4534,4540],["many weeks",4829,4839],["the months of July",5645,5663],["August",5668,5674],["midsummer",6515,6524],["days",6589,6593]],"times":[["all hours",3615,3624]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["hither",289,295],["there",542,547],["beyond",1104,1110],["there",1528,1533],["there",1818,1823],["there",3757,3762],["here",4508,4512],["away",6180,6184],["there",6458,6463]],"spa_preps":[["among",907,912],["out",1296,1299],["into",1696,1700],["through",1893,1900],["through",2282,2289],["between",2589,2596],["about",3648,3653],["near",3842,3846],["close",4525,4530],["down",4597,4601],["about",4922,4927],["out",4991,4994],["among",6082,6087]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0625,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9972102046},{"para_id":102,"paragraph":"Thus far respecting the most eligible season for visiting this country.

But a short residence among the British Mountains will furnish abundant proof, that, after a certain point, the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation to objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude; and, that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in the most impressive degree the creative and magnifying powers of the atmosphere; so that, on the score even of sublimity, the superiority of the Alps is be no means so great as might hastily be inferred;-- and, as to the beauty of the lower regions of the Swiss mountains, it is noticable-- that, as they are all regularly mown, their surface has nothing of the mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished.

On the Italian side of the Alps, chestnut and walnut-trees grow to a considerable height on the mountains; but, even there, the foliage is not equal in beauty to the natural product of this climate.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Britain",339,346],["Switzerland",420,431],["Britain",746,753],["Snowdon",1049,1056],["Helvellyn",1061,1070],["Ullswater",1130,1139],["Alps",1168,1172]],"geonouns":[["points",12,18],["woods",133,138],["trees",390,395],["trees",442,447],["hill",495,499],["tree",613,617],["common",646,652],["trees",843,848],["woods",890,895],["head",1122,1126],["trees",1194,1199],["mountains",1237,1246]],"pos_words":[["superior",46,54],["variety",273,280],["beauty",285,291],["fine",437,441],["luxuriant",544,553],["beauty",554,560],["great",825,830],["agreeable",925,934],["rich",945,949],["harmonious",954,964],["beauty",1293,1299]],"neg_words":[["inferior",725,733],["scarcely",853,861]],"events":[],"dates":[["all seasons",903,914]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",351,355],["here",525,529],["there",534,539],["there",1258,1263]],"spa_preps":[["over",486,490]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0789473684,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9915442467},{"para_id":117,"paragraph":"As my object is to reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own country, though not at the expence of truth, I am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view, our Lakes also are much more interesting than those of the Alps; first, as is implied above, from being more happily proportioned to the other features of the landscape, and next, both as being infinitely more pellucid, and less subject to agitation from the winds. Como( which may perhaps be styled the King of Lakes, as Lugano is certainly the Queen) is disturbed by a periodical wind blowing from the head in the morning, and towards it in the afternoon. The magnificent Lake of the four Cantons, especially its noblest division, called the Lake of Uri, is not only much agitated by winds, but in the night time is disturbed from the bottom, as I was told, and indeed as I witnessed, without any apparent commotion in the air; and, when at rest, the water is not pure to the eye, but of a heavy green hue,-- as is that of the other lakes apparently, according to the degree in which they are fed by melted snows. If the Lake of Geneva furnishes an exception, this is probably owing to its vast extent which allows the water to deposit its impurities. The water of the English Lakes, on the contrary, being of a crystalline clearness, the reflections of the surrounding hills are frequently so lively, that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the point where the real object terminates, and its unsubstantial duplicate begins. The lower part of the Lake of Geneva,( from its narrowness, must be much less subject to agitation than the higher divisions, and, as the water is clearer than that of the other Swiss Lakes, it may exhibit this appearance, though it is not possible in an equal degree. During two comprehensive Tours among the Alps, I did not observe, except on one of the smaller Lakes, between Lugano and Ponte Tresa, a single instance of those beautiful repetitions of the surrounding scenery in the bosom of the water, which are so frequently seen here: not to speak of the fine, dazzling trembling net-work, breezy motions, and streaks and circles of intermingled smooth and rippled water, which make the surface of our Lakes a field of endless variety. But among the Alps where every thing tends to the grand and the sublime, in surfaces as well as in forms, if the Lakes do not court the placid reflections of land objects, those of first - rate magnitude make compensation, in some degree, by exhibiting those ever-changing fields of green, blue, and purple shadows or lights,( one scarcely knows which to name them) that call to mind a sea-prospect contemplated from a lofty cliff.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Lakes",171,176],["Alps",226,230],["Lakes",479,484],["English Lakes",1238,1251],["Lakes",1683,1688],["Alps",1809,1813],["Lakes",1863,1868],["Lakes",2207,2212],["Alps",2255,2259],["Lakes",2354,2359]],"geonouns":[["country",64,71],["points",151,157],["landscape",326,335],["head",571,575],["water",920,925],["lakes",1002,1007],["water",1188,1193],["water",1225,1230],["hills",1339,1344],["point",1419,1424],["water",1637,1642],["water",1998,2003],["water",2170,2175],["field",2215,2220],["land",2399,2403],["fields",2514,2520],["sea",2627,2630]],"pos_words":[["reconcile",19,28],["interesting",196,207],["happily",276,283],["magnificent",629,640],["pure",933,937],["lively",1363,1369],["clearer",1646,1653],["comprehensive",1779,1792],["beautiful",1929,1938],["fine",2060,2064],["dazzling",2066,2074],["work",2089,2093],["smooth",2151,2157],["variety",2232,2239],["grand",2291,2296],["sublime",2305,2312],["well",2329,2333],["first - rate",2422,2434]],"neg_words":[["object",6,12],["afraid",118,124],["disturbed",523,532],["disturbed",785,794],["commotion",875,884],["scarcely",1382,1390],["object",1440,1446],["scarcely",2572,2580]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the morning",579,590],["the afternoon",610,623],["the night",767,776]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",854,861],["here",2034,2038]],"spa_preps":[["above",253,258],["among",1799,1804],["between",1870,1877],["among",2245,2250]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0444444444,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974950552},{"para_id":118,"paragraph":"The subject of torrents and water falls has already been touched upon; but it may be added that the perpetual accompaniment of snow upon the higher regions, takes much from the effect of foaming white streams; while, from their frequency, they obstruct in some degree each other's influence upon the mind of the spectator; and, in all cases, the effect of an individual cataract, excepting the great Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen, is diminished by the general fury of the stream of which it is a part.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["water",28,33],["regions",148,155],["streams",201,208],["cataract",370,378],["stream",476,482]],"pos_words":[["great",394,399]],"neg_words":[["falls",34,39],["obstruct",244,252],["fury",464,468]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0465116279,"vader_sentiment":0.15,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9931554198},{"para_id":119,"paragraph":"Recurring to the reflexions from still water, I will describe a similar phenomenon of this kind of which I was an eye-witness.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["water",39,44]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9903005362},{"para_id":120,"paragraph":"Walking by the side of Ullswater upon a calm September morning, I saw, deep within the bosom of the lake, a magnificent Castle, with towers and battlements; nothing could be more distinct than the whole edifice;-- after gazing with delight upon it for some time, as upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance.

The lower part is rarely visited, but as many interesting points of view, especially at Storr's Hall and at Fellfort, where the Coniston Mountains peer nobly over the western barrier, which is elsewhere along the whole Lake is comparatively tame. To one also who has ascended the hill from Grathwaite on the western side, the promontory called Rawlinson's Nab, Storr's Hall, and the Troutbeck Mountains, about sunset, make a splendid landscape. The view from the Pleasure House of the Station near the Ferry has suffered much from Larch plantations, and from other causes. Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing to its greater size, to the islands, and its having two vales at the head, with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at the same time from any one point, except from the bosom of the Lake. The Islands may be explored at any time of day; but one bright unruffled evening, must, if possible, be set apart for the splendour, the stillness, and solemnity of a three hours' voyage upon the division of the Lake, not omitting, towards the end of the excursion, to quite the expanse of water, and peep into the close and calm River at the head; which, in its quiet character, at such a time, appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful Lake itself, than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended, or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied. Many persons content themselves with what they see of Windermere during their progress in a boat from Bowness to the head of the Lake, walking thence to Ambleside. But the whole road of from Bowness is rich in diversity of pleasing or grand scenery; there is scarcely a field on the road side; there is scarcely a field on the road side, which, if entered, would not give to the landscape some additional charm. Low Wood Inn, a mile from the head of Windermere, is a pleasant halting-place; and the fields above it, and the lane that leads to Troutbeck, present beautiful views towards each extremity of the Lake. From this place and from Ambleside, rides may be taken in numerous directions, and the interesting walks are inexhaustible; a few out of the main road may be particularized;-- the lane that leads towards Skelgill; the ride, or walk by Rothay Bridge, and up the stream under Loughrigg Fell, continued on the western side of Rydal Lake, and thence round the church of Grasmere: or, turning round Loughrigg Fell by Loughrigg Tarn and the River Brathay, back to Ambleside. From Ambleside is a charming excursion, by Skelwith Fold an Colwith Force up Little Langdale, Blea Tarn, Dungeon Ghyll waterfall( if there be time) and down Great Langdale. Stockghyll Force and Rydal waterfalls, every one hears of. In addition to the two Streams at its head with their Vales, Windermere communicates with two lateral Vales, that of Troutbeck, distinguished by the mountains at its head, by picturesque remains of cottage architecture, and by fine fore-grounds formed by the steep and winding banks of the river. The other, the vale Hawkshead, is seen to most advantage by the approach from the ferry over Windermere-- the Lake of Esthwaite. Hawkshead Church, and the cone of Langdale Pike in the distance. There are delightful walks in that part of Grasmere, called Easefale; and the Vale is advantageously seen from Butterlip How. As this point is four miles on the way to Keswick, it may here be mentioned, that, from the high road between Keswick and Ambleside, which passes along the eastern side of the several Lakes of Rydal, Grasmere, and part of Wythburn, these lakes are not seen to the best advantage, particularly Rydal, and Wythburn-- the lower half of which is entirely lost. If, therefore, the excursion from Ambleside has not been taken, a traveller on foot or or horseback would not be well recompensed by quitting the high road at Rydal over Pelter Bridge,-- proceeding on the western side of the two lakes to Grasmere Church; and, thence to Butterlip How. A second deviation may be made when he has advanced a little beyond the mile-stone, the sixth short of Keswick, whence there is a fine view of Legbertwhaite, with Blencathara( commonly called Saddleback) in front. Having previously enquired, at the inn near Wythburn Chapel, the best way from his mile-stone to the bridge that divides the Lake, he must cross it, and proceed, with the Lake on the right, to the Hamlet near its termination, and rejoin the main road upon Shoulthwaite Moss, about four miles from Keswick. These two deviations lengthen the journey something less than three miles. Helvellyn may be ascended from Dunmail Raise by a foot Traveller, or from the Inn at Wythburn.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Bowness",96,103],["Orrest",110,116],["Coniston

It may be here mentioned that Bassenthwaite Chapel, yet stands in a bay as sequestered, as the Site of Old Church; such situations having been chosen in disturbed times to elude marauders.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Keswick",26,33],["Matterdale",37,47],["Lyulph's Tower",52,66],["Airey Force",157,168],["Ullswater",244,253],["Penrith,",273,281],["Emont",334,339],["Patterdale",395,405],["Ullswater",438,447],["Westmorland",633,644],["Martindale",672,682],["Cumberland",1043,1053],["Old Church",1077,1087],["Patterdale",1126,1136],["Yew Tree",1154,1162],["Old Church",1175,1185],["Carlisle",1348,1356],["Elizabeth",1389,1398],["Bassenthwaite Chapel",1488,1508],["Old Church",1561,1571]],"geonouns":[["road",235,239],["winding",318,325],["vale",326,330],["road",456,460],["water",657,662],["road",729,733],["fields",743,749],["foot",952,956],["boat",972,976],["road",1110,1114],["bay",1526,1529]],"pos_words":[["finely",3,9],["magnificent",92,103],["advantage",535,544],["magnificent",755,766]],"neg_words":[["disturbed",1611,1620]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of the",994,1008]],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile and a half",282,299],["four miles",421,431],["at least three miles",602,622],["three or four miles",929,948]],"loc_advs":[["left",200,204],["across",1029,1035],["near",1072,1076],["upwards",1115,1122],["there",1191,1196],["here",1468,1472]],"spa_preps":[["into",67,71],["down",178,182],["along",432,437],["round",568,573],["along",623,628],["into",734,738]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0197368421,"vader_sentiment":0.78,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984947443},{"para_id":161,"paragraph":"The Trunk, or Body of the Vale of Ullswater need not be further noticed, as its beauties shew themselves: but the curious Traveller may wish to know something of its tributary Streams.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Ullswater",34,43]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977377653},{"para_id":162,"paragraph":"At Dalemain. about three miles from Penrith, a Stream is crossed called the Dacre, or Dacor, which name it bore as early as the time of the Venerable Bede. This stream does not enter the Lake, but joins the Emont a mile below; it rises in the moorish Country about Penruddock, flows down a soft sequestered Valley, passing by the ancient mansions of Hutton John and Dacre Castle. The former is pleasantly situation, though of a character somewhat gloomy and monastic, and from some of the fields near Dalemain, Dacre Castle, backed by the jagged summit of Saddle Back, with the Valley and Stream in front, forms a grand picture. There is no other stream that conducts to any glen or valley worthy of being mentioned, till we reach that which leads up to Airey Force, and thence into Matterdale, before spoken of. Matterdale, though a wild and interesting spot, has no peculiar features that would make it worth the Stranger's while to go in search of them; but in Gowbarrow Park, the lover of Nature might linger for hours. Here is a powerful Brook, which dashes among rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets. These are the attractions of the retired views, or constitute a foreground for ever-varying pictures of the majestic Lake, forced to take a winding course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of sublime form, tower about each other. At the outlet of Gowbarrow Park, we reach a third stream, which flows through a little recess called Glencoin, where lurks a single house, yet visible from the road. Let the Artist or leisurely Traveller turn aside to it, for the buildings and objects around them are romantic and picturesque. Having passed under the steeps of Styebarrow Crag, and the remains of its native woods, at Glenridding Bridge, a fourth stream is crossed.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Dalemain",3,11],["Penrith,",36,44],["Dacre",76,81],["Dacor",86,91],["Emont",207,212],["Penruddock",265,275],["Hutton John",350,361],["Dacre Castle",366,378],["Dalemain",501,509],["Dacre Castle",511,523],["Airey Force",754,765],["Matterdale",783,793],["Matterdale",813,823],["Gowbarrow Park",964,978],["Gowbarrow Park",1594,1608],["Glencoin",1678,1686],["Styebarrow Crag",1905,1920],["Glenridding Bridge",1962,1980]],"geonouns":[["stream",161,167],["mansions",338,346],["fields",489,495],["summit",546,552],["stream",647,653],["glen",675,679],["valley",683,689],["rocks",1069,1074],["glen",1090,1094],["wood",1160,1164],["beds",1175,1179],["lawns",1300,1305],["winding",1472,1479],["promontories",1495,1507],["mountains",1526,1535],["tower",1553,1558],["outlet",1584,1590],["stream",1627,1633],["house",1709,1714],["road",1737,1741],["buildings",1807,1816],["woods",1952,1957],["stream",1991,1997]],"pos_words":[["soft",290,294],["pleasantly",394,404],["grand",614,619],["worthy",690,696],["leads",742,747],["interesting",843,854],["worth",905,910],["lover",984,989],["powerful",1034,1042],["rich",1122,1126],["happy",1131,1136],["luxuriant",1183,1192],["majestic",1440,1448],["sublime",1539,1546],["romantic",1845,1853],["picturesque",1858,1869]],"neg_words":[["bore",107,111],["gloomy",447,453],["jagged",539,545],["wild",834,838],["peculiar",868,876],["hung",1096,1100]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["hours",1017,1022]],"distances":[["about three miles",13,30],["a mile",213,219]],"loc_advs":[["near",496,500],["here",1166,1170]],"spa_preps":[["below",220,225],["about",259,264],["down",283,287],["into",778,782],["among",1063,1068],["through",1075,1082],["over",1291,1295],["through",1310,1317],["about",1559,1564],["through",1647,1654],["aside",1786,1791],["around",1829,1835],["under",1885,1890]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0546448087,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9970738888},{"para_id":163,"paragraph":"The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale, down which the Stream flows, is adorned with fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, that agreeably unite with the transverse views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind, will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfalls to a silent Tarn in the recesses of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the precipice which forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the solitary angler. It also derives a melancholy interest frmo the fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished some years ago, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months, self-supported, and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master. But to return to the road in the main Vale of Ullswater. -- At the head of the Lake( being now in Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck; this would conduct through a woody steep, where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies, up to the level area of the Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for foot-travellers, and among which a horse may be led, to Grasmere. A sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending the bed of this valley, and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn. Having retraced the banks of the Stream to Patterdale, and pursued the road up the main Dale, the next considerable Stream would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct to Deep Dale, the character of which Valley may be conjectured from its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss, with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it, by the west wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of Brother's - water and passed Hartsop Hall, a Stream soon after issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never explored by Travellers; but, from these sylvan and rocky recesses whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of Brother's - water, or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of Dove Crag. &amp; c. will be equally pleased with the beauty, the grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Ullswater Vale",27,41],["Helvellyn",348,357],["Grasmere",713,721],["Ullswater",974,983],["Patterdale",1026,1036],["Grisdale Beck",1063,1076],["Grisdale",1214,1222],["Grasmere",1306,1314],["Helvellyn",1512,1521],["Patterdale",1566,1576],["Fairfield",1947,1956],["Hartsop Hall",2033,2045],["Dove Crag",2339,2348]],"geonouns":[["fields",96,102],["cottages",104,112],["groves",126,132],["water",284,289],["waterfalls",301,311],["precipice",428,437],["head",517,521],["rocks",675,680],["road",949,953],["head",995,999],["path",1241,1245],["foot",1250,1254],["mountain",1341,1349],["bed",1393,1396],["valley",1405,1411],["path",1451,1455],["banks",1543,1548],["road",1594,1598],["cove",1793,1797],["summit",1937,1943],["water",2016,2021],["cove",2081,2085],["wood",2115,2119],["water",2276,2281],["ridges",2329,2335]],"pos_words":[["fertile",88,95],["agreeably",139,148],["lead",268,272],["silent",317,323],["faithful",765,773],["supported",837,846],["master",920,926],["led",1298,1301],["sublime",1318,1325],["leads",1456,1461],["faithful",1852,1860],["richly",2086,2092],["pleased",2375,2382],["beauty",2392,2398],["grandeur",2404,2412]],"neg_words":[["breaks",290,296],["desolate",364,372],["melancholy",564,574],["stranger",616,624],["falling",658,665],["steep",1113,1118],["unusually",1143,1152],["gloomy",1812,1818],["abyss",1819,1824],["precipitous",1831,1842],["issues",2067,2073],["rocky",2203,2208],["precipitous",2301,2312]],"events":[],"dates":[["some years ago",639,653],["three months",818,830]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",250,254],["behind",255,261],["here",796,800],["there",1230,1235],["forward",2286,2293]],"spa_preps":[["down",43,47],["along",273,278],["round",507,512],["down",666,670],["over",705,709],["through",1097,1104],["among",1271,1276],["under",1481,1486],["into",1901,1905],["along",1978,1983]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0089285714,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987825751},{"para_id":164,"paragraph":"Seven Glens or Vallies have been noticed, which branch off from the Cumberland side of the Vale. The opposite side has only two Streams of any importance, one of which would lead up from the point where it crosses Kirkstone Road, near the foot of Brother's - water, to the decaying hamlet of Hartsop, remarkable for its cottage architecture, and thence to Hayswater, much frequented by anglers. The other, coming down Martindale, enters Ullswater at Sandwike, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. No persons but such as come to Patterdale, merely to pass through it, should fail to walk as far as Blowick, the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the Lake. The axe has here indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks, that divided this favoured spot into a hundred pictures. It has yet its land-locked bays, and rocky promontories; but those beautiful woods are gone, which perfected its seclusion; and scenes, that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible volume, are now spread before the eye in a single sheet, magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused in a moment! From Blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of Place Fell, richly adorned with juniper, and sprinkled over with birches, to the Village of Sandwyke; a few straggling houses, that with the small estates attached to them, occupy an opening opposite to Lyulph's Tower and Gowbarrow Park. This stream flows down Martindale, a valley deficient in richness, but interesting from its seclusion. In Vales of this character the general want of wood gives a peculiar interest to the scattered cottages, embowered in sycamores; and few of the Mountain Chapels are more striking than this of Martindale, standing as it does in the centre of the Valley, with one dark yew-tree, and enclosed by\" a bare ring of mossy wall.\" The name of Boardale, a deep, bare, and houseless Valley, which communicates with Martindale, shews that the wild Swine were once numerous in that nook; and Martindale Forest is yet one of the few spots in England ranged over by red deer. These are the descendents of the aboriginal herds. In Martindale, the road loses sight of the Lake, and leads over a steep hill, bringing you again into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach, four miles in length, is before you; and the view terminated by the long ridge of Cross Fell in the distance. Immediately under the eye is a deep-indented bay, with a plot of fertile land, traversed by a small brook, and rendered chearful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented and showy appearance than usual in these wild spots.","file_id":"1822_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",68,78],["Kirkstone",214,223],["Hartsop",292,299],["Martindale",418,428],["Ullswater",437,446],["Gowbarrow Park",472,486],["Patterdale",519,529],["Blowick",588,595],["Blowick",1121,1128],["Place Fell",1178,1188],["Sandwyke",1270,1278],["Lyulph's Tower",1381,1395],["Gowbarrow Park",1400,1414],["Martindale",1439,1449],["Martindale",1711,1721],["Martindale",1923,1933],["Martindale",1998,2008],["England",2047,2054],["Martindale",2134,2144],["Ullswater",2241,2250],["Cross Fell",2352,2362]],"geonouns":[["point",191,196],["foot",239,243],["water",259,264],["hamlet",282,288],["cottage",320,327],["pass",541,545],["land",615,619],["wood",726,730],["land",824,828],["bays",836,840],["promontories",852,864],["woods",886,891],["track",1138,1143],["houses",1297,1303],["stream",1421,1427],["valley",1453,1459],["wood",1566,1570],["cottages",1614,1622],["tree",1790,1794],["wall",1834,1838],["nook",1988,1992],["road",2150,2154],["hill",2203,2207],["ridge",2343,2348],["bay",2425,2428],["land",2453,2457],["brook",2480,2485],["houses",2537,2543]],"pos_words":[["lead",174,178],["remarkable",301,311],["rich",721,725],["beautiful",876,885],["magnificent",1061,1072],["richly",1190,1196],["richness",1473,1481],["interesting",1487,1498],["striking",1689,1697],["leads",2184,2189],["fertile",2445,2452]],"neg_words":[["fail",565,569],["indiscriminately",693,709],["rocky",846,851],["deficient",1460,1469],["peculiar",1579,1587],["dark",1781,1785],["wild",1950,1954],["loses",2155,2160],["steep",2197,2202],["plot",2437,2441],["wild",2606,2610]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["four miles",2270,2280]],"loc_advs":[["here",688,692]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",101,109],["near",230,234],["down",413,417],["opposite",460,468],["through",546,553],["into",784,788],["along",1153,1158],["over",1233,1237],["opposite",1369,1377],["down",1434,1438],["over",2062,2066],["over",2190,2194],["into",2228,2232],["under",2392,2397]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9841301441},{"para_id":165,"paragraph":"From Poolly Bridge, at the foot of the Lake, Hawes Water may be conveniently visited.
