If the time should ever come when iron roads will intersect the mountainous parts of Westmorland and Cumberland, that time is not yet; nor is in view,-- loud as have been the lamentations of some residents, as if it were to happen to-morrow. No one who has ascended Dunmail Raise, or visited the head of Coniston Lake, or gone by Kirkstone to Patterdale, will for a moment imagine that any conceivable railway will carry strangers over those passes, for generations to come. It is a great thing that steam can convey travellers round the outskirts of the district, up to its openings.

There are the loftiest peaks and deepest valleys. These are surrounded by somewhat lower ridges and shallower vales; and these again by others, till the uplands are mere hills and the valleys scarcely sunk at all. It is into these exterior undulations that the railways penetrate; and, at the first ridge of any steepness, they must stop. It is this which decides the termination of the Windermere railroad, and which prevents the lateral railways from coming nearer than the outer base of the hills on the east and the coast on the west. When the traveller on foot or horseback sees certain reaches of Lake Windermere from Orrest Head, lying deep down below him, he knows he is coming near the end of the railway, which cannot yet plunge and climb as our old mail roads must do, if they exist here at all. As a general rule, lakes should be approached from the foot, that the ridges may rise, instead of sinking, before the observers eye. But so happy is the access to Windermere from the station, that it is hard to say that it could have been better; and that access is, not from the suoth to its lower end, but from the south-east to about its middle. The old coach road over Orrest Head and the railway meet at the new village of Windermere, whence the road to Bowness descends, winding down for about a mile and a half, striking the shore at a point rather more than half way up the lake, and commanding the group of mountains that cluster about its head.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",23,33],["Westmorland",38,49],["Scawfell",110,118],["Windermere",522,532],["Lake Windermere",738,753],["Orrest",759,765],["Windermere",1105,1115],["Orrest",1315,1321],["Windermere",1370,1380],["Bowness",1401,1408]],"geonouns":[["mountain",4,12],["region",13,19],["mountains",90,99],["peaks",158,163],["valleys",176,183],["ridges",224,230],["vales",245,250],["mere",300,304],["hills",305,310],["valleys",319,326],["railways",396,404],["ridge",434,439],["railways",574,582],["hills",629,634],["coast",655,660],["foot",696,700],["railway",841,848],["roads",900,905],["lakes",961,966],["foot",997,1001],["ridges",1012,1018],["station",1125,1132],["coach",1299,1304],["road",1305,1309],["railway",1335,1342],["village",1359,1366],["road",1393,1397],["winding",1419,1426],["shore",1474,1479],["point",1485,1490],["lake",1524,1528],["mountains",1558,1567],["head",1591,1595]],"pos_words":[["happy",1082,1087],["better",1181,1187],["striking",1461,1469]],"neg_words":[["scarcely",327,335],["sunk",336,340],["lying",772,777],["sinking",1040,1047],["hard",1145,1149]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of the",826,840]],"times":[],"distances":[["about a mile and a half",1436,1459]],"loc_advs":[["near",821,825],["here",929,933]],"spa_preps":[["into",355,359],["down",783,787],["below",788,793],["about",1273,1278],["over",1310,1314],["down",1427,1431],["about",1581,1586]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0151515152,"vader_sentiment":0.79,"roberta_sentiment":-0.7534372807},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"Supposing that the traveller desires to see the Windermere scenery thoroughly, we shall divide our directions into portions; first exhibiting what is to be seen in the immediate neighbourhood of the Windermere Hotel, or within a moderate walk; and then describing three tours, two of which may be easily taken in a day each.

Already, a traveller who should remain any time in the district would find himself introduced to the humours of a remote region. Odd sayings and doings remain, and traditions of old singularities are not lost.

He called them his\" jolly companions;\" and no doubt he got a world of amusement out of them, in return for his hospitality. The local saying,\" that's too big a bo-o for a young horse,\" was Josiah Brown's, and it was originated thus. He was breaking in a young horse, when one of his men took a liberty,-- such as his servants were always taking with him,-- but in this case to be repented of.

The whole length of Windermere extends below, with its enclosing hills and wooded islands; and towards the head, some of the highest peaks and ridges may be seen:-- Coniston Old Man to the west; Bowfell and the Langdale Pikes to the northwest; Fairfield to the north, with Loughrigg lying, as a mere dark ridge, across the head of Windermere; while, to the north-east, Troutbeck is disclosed, with its peaks of High Street and Hill Bell. All below are woods, with houses peeping out; on a height of the opposite shore, Wray Castle; further north, the little Brathay Chapel, set down near the mouth of the valley; and between Loughrigg and the lake, at its head, the white houses of Clappersgate, with the chateau-like mansion of Croft Lodge conspicuous above the rest. This view is a good deal like the one from the hill behind the Windermere Hotel, which is reached by the lane turning off from Orrest Head. The Elleray one is the most extensive and complete to the north: but to enjoy the other, leave will be readily obtained at the hotel.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Windermere",521,531],["Coniston",666,674],["Old Man",675,682],["Bowfell",696,703],["Langdale Pikes",712,726],["Fairfield",745,754],["Loughrigg",774,783],["Windermere",832,842],["Troutbeck",870,879],["High Street",912,923],["Bell",933,937],["Castle",1025,1031],["Brathay",1059,1066],["Loughrigg",1126,1135],["Clappersgate",1183,1195],["Croft Lodge",1230,1241],["Windermere",1333,1343],["Orrest",1397,1403]],"geonouns":[["hill",4,8],["lake",76,80],["grounds",260,267],["hill",312,316],["lake",451,455],["district",482,490],["hills",566,571],["islands",583,590],["head",608,612],["peaks",634,639],["ridges",644,650],["mere",796,800],["ridge",806,811],["head",824,828],["peaks",903,908],["woods",953,958],["houses",965,971],["shore",1013,1018],["mouth",1093,1098],["valley",1106,1112],["lake",1144,1148],["head",1157,1161],["houses",1173,1179],["mansion",1219,1226],["hill",1317,1321],["lane",1375,1379],["hotel",1537,1542]],"pos_words":[["right",16,21],["well",58,62],["improved",124,132],["good",206,210],["fortune",211,218],["exquisite",387,396],["finest",471,477],["like",1214,1218],["good",1285,1289],["like",1295,1299],["enjoy",1482,1487],["readily",1513,1520]],"neg_words":[["object",279,285],["lying",784,789],["dark",801,805],["conspicuous",1242,1253]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["a height of",988,999]],"distances":[["about 700 feet",426,440]],"loc_advs":[["home",81,85],["below",540,545],["opposite",1004,1012],["above",1254,1259],["behind",1322,1328]],"spa_preps":[["above",441,446],["across",813,819],["below",943,948],["out",980,983],["down",1079,1083],["near",1084,1088],["between",1118,1125]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0571428571,"vader_sentiment":0.91,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986889958},{"para_id":20,"paragraph":"A portion of the Elleray grounds are open to the public every Monday and Friday.

Addison, of Windermere, has a passion for ecclesiastical architecture; and his example has been a good deal followed. There is the little church of St. Mary, and there are the schools belonging to it, with their steep roofs of curiously shaped-slates: and there is St. Mary's Abbey,( new, in spite of its antique name), and St. Mary's Cottage. And there will be the new college of St. Mary, standing in a fine position, between the main road and the descent to the lake. This college, of which the Rev. J.A. Addison is the warden, is designed to afford a cheap and thorough education, on sound church principles, to the sons of clergymen chiefly, though not exclusively. It is under high patronage, ecclesiastical and local. The pupils, in a college garb of the olden time, are a curious feature in the aspect of the place; and they will be more so when they get their new buildings to live in. Judging by the plan and elevation put forth, the edifice will be in excellent taste, and a great adornment to the neigbourhood.

There can hardly be a more charming resting-place than a seat under the last trees of this projection. It is breezy here; and the waters smack the shore cheerily. The Troutbeck hills come into view, and the head of the lake is grander. The round house on Curwen's island is seen among the trees. The Ferry house, under its canopy of tall sycamores, and with its pebbly beach, is immediately opposite; and behind it rises the wooded bank which is, in light or shadow, one of the chief graces of the scene. If the sun shines upon it, it is feathered with foliage to the very ridge, and the bay beneath it is blue and lustrous. If the sun has gone down behind it, the bay is black; and every dipping bird sprinkles it with silver; and the wild duck that comes sailing out with her brood, draws behind her a pencil of white light. From this point, a view opens to the south. In the expanse of waters lies another island; and further down, on the eastern shore, a pier extends with a little tower at the end. This is Storrs: and at that pier did the guests embark when Scott went to meet Canning at Mr. Bolton's, and the fine regatta took place,( under the direction of Christopher North) which is celebrated in Lockhart's Life of Scott. This was only two years before Canning's death, and seven before that of Scott. Mr. and Mrs. Bolton are gone; and Christopher North himself has followed. It is probable that no stranger ever see that pier at Storrs without thinking of Professor Wilson; and, indeed, there is no spot in the neighbourhood with which his memory, and the gratitude of his readers, is not associated. Any where, such a presence is rarely seen; and it was especially impressive in the places her best loved to haunt. More than one person has said that Wilson reminded them of the first man, Adam; so full was his large frame of vitality, force and sentience. His tread seemed to shake the ground, and his glance to pierce through stone walls; and, as for his voice, there was no heart that could stand before it. In his hour of emotion, he swept away all hearts, whithersoever he would. No less striking was it to see him in a mood of repose, as he was seen when steering the packet-boat that used to pass between Bowness and Ambleside, before the steamers were put upon the lake. Sitting motionless, with his hand upon the rudder, in the presence of journeymen and market-women, and his eye apparently looking beyond everything into nothing, and his mouth closed above his beard, as if he meant never to speak again, he was quite as impressive and immortal an image as he could have been to the students of his moral philosophy class, or the comrades of his jovial hours. He was known, and with reverence and affection, besides the trout-stream and the mountain tarn, and, amidst the damp gloom of Elleray, where he could not bring himself to let a tree or a sprig be lopped that his wife had loved. Every old boatman and young angler, every hoary shepherd and primitive dame among the hills of the district, knew him and enjoyed his presence. He made others happy by being so intensely happy himself, when his brighter moods were on him; and when he was mournful, no one desired to be gay. He is gone with his joy and his grief; and the region is so much the darker in a thousand eyes.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Ferry",113,118],["Ferry",157,162],["Troutbeck",386,395],["Ferry",519,524],["Bolton",1317,1323],["Bolton",1545,1551],["Bowness",2444,2451],["Ambleside",2456,2465]],"geonouns":[["point",88,93],["promontory",101,111],["point",186,191],["promontory",207,217],["seat",276,280],["trees",296,301],["waters",349,355],["shore",366,371],["hills",396,401],["head",426,430],["lake",438,442],["house",465,470],["island",483,489],["trees",508,513],["house",525,530],["beach",588,593],["bank",651,655],["ridge",792,797],["bay",807,810],["bay",884,887],["point",1056,1061],["waters",1108,1114],["island",1128,1134],["shore",1169,1174],["pier",1178,1182],["tower",1205,1210],["pier",1251,1255],["pier",1652,1656],["force",2068,2073],["ground",2119,2125],["stone",2160,2165],["walls",2166,2171],["boat",2413,2417],["pass",2431,2435],["steamers",2478,2486],["lake",2505,2509],["market",2596,2602],["mouth",2681,2686],["stream",2969,2975],["mountain",2984,2992],["tarn",2993,2997],["tree",3080,3084],["hills",3217,3222],["district",3230,3238],["region",3469,3475]],"pos_words":[["charming",246,254],["lustrous",834,842],["fine",1335,1339],["celebrated",1412,1422],["gratitude",1787,1796],["impressive",1897,1907],["best",1926,1930],["loved",1931,1936],["striking",2325,2333],["impressive",2764,2774],["jovial",2889,2895],["reverence",2926,2935],["affection",2940,2949],["loved",3124,3129],["enjoyed",3253,3260],["happy",3290,3295],["happy",3318,3323],["brighter",3342,3350],["joy",3442,3445]],"neg_words":[["smack",356,361],["wild",955,959],["brood",997,1002],["lies",1115,1119],["death",1493,1498],["stranger",1629,1637],["haunt",1940,1945],["shake",2109,2114],["motionless",2519,2529],["gloom",3020,3025],["primitive",3192,3201],["mournful",3386,3394],["grief",3454,3459],["darker",3491,3497]],"events":[],"dates":[["only two years",1461,1475]],"times":[["his hour",2246,2254],["hours",2896,2901]],"distances":[["about a mile",49,61]],"loc_advs":[["opposite",198,206],["here",335,339],["beneath",811,818],["without",1667,1674],["there",1718,1723],["there",2196,2201],["beyond",2641,2647]],"spa_preps":[["along",19,24],["out",140,143],["opposite",144,152],["under",281,286],["into",407,411],["round",459,464],["among",498,503],["under",532,537],["opposite",610,618],["behind",624,630],["down",864,868],["behind",869,875],["out",984,987],["behind",1010,1016],["down",1148,1152],["under",1361,1366],["through",2152,2159],["away",2276,2280],["between",2436,2443],["into",2659,2663],["above",2694,2699],["amidst",3004,3010],["among",3207,3212]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0161290323,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988527298},{"para_id":29,"paragraph":"Instead of returning to his inn the way he came, the stranger may make a moderate and pleasant walk by going through Bowness on the Ambleside road, and round by Cook's House.

Hence is seen what, in our opinion, is a view unsurpassed for beauty in the whole Lake District. The entire lake lies below, the white houses of Clappersgate being distinctly visible at the north end and the Beacon at the south: and the diversity of the framework of this sheet of water is here most striking. The Calgarth woods, for which we are indebted to Bishop Watson, rising and falling, spreading and contracting below, with green undulating meadows interposed, are a perfect treat to the eye; and so are the islands clustering in the centre of the lake. Wray Castle stands forth well above the promontory opposite; and at the head, the Langdale Pikes, and their surrounding mountains seem, in some states of the atmosphere, to approach and overshadow the waters; and in others to retire, and shroud themselves in soft haze and delicate hues peculiar to cloud land. There is a new house, built just below the ridge at Miller Brow by William Sheldon, which we have thought, from the time the foundation was laid, the most enviable abode in the country,-- commanding a view worthy of a mountain top, while sheltered by hill and wood, and with the main road so close at hand that the conveniences of life are as procurable as in a street. A short descent hence brings the walker to Cook's House,-- the point where four roads meet. Cook's house has only just disappeared. With it has disappeared a fine specimen of the old fireplace of the district, with its chimney-corners. It is rather a drawback to the romance hanging about those wide old chimnies, to know that the good man had to sit with some special covering over his head and shoulders, to protect him from the spot that the rain brought down. At Cook's house there were recesses and cupboards in that strange roofless alcove,-- the door being of the old oak of which such fine specimens may be seen the farm-houses of the dales. We should rather say, might till lately have been seen; for we fear there are but few left. The greater number of old chests, cupboard doors, and high backed chairs, covered with carvings, have found their way to the London curiosity shops, whence agents have been sent through the wildest places in the district to buy up such relics at high prices. Still, there are specimens left, as the observant traveller will notice.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Lake District",227,240],["Clappersgate",290,302],["Beacon",353,359],["Calgarth",459,467],["Castle",712,718],["Langdale Pikes",789,803],["London",2255,2261]],"geonouns":[["woods",20,25],["streams",52,59],["road",65,69],["summit",106,112],["lake",253,257],["houses",280,286],["water",426,431],["woods",468,473],["meadows",594,601],["islands",661,668],["lake",701,705],["promontory",747,757],["head",779,783],["mountains",827,836],["waters",908,914],["land",1012,1016],["house",1033,1038],["ridge",1061,1066],["mountain",1236,1244],["top",1245,1248],["hill",1269,1273],["wood",1278,1282],["road",1302,1306],["street",1380,1386],["point",1451,1456],["roads",1468,1473],["house",1487,1492],["district",1588,1596],["head",1775,1779],["house",1862,1867],["door",1941,1945],["farm",2012,2016],["houses",2017,2023],["dales",2031,2036],["doors",2173,2178],["district",2342,2350]],"pos_words":[["resounding",27,37],["leads",70,75],["beauty",207,213],["striking",445,453],["indebted",492,500],["perfect",620,627],["well",732,736],["soft",966,970],["delicate",980,988],["enviable",1173,1181],["worthy",1224,1230],["good",1719,1723],["protect",1798,1805],["fine",1981,1985]],"neg_words":[["steep",88,93],["lies",258,262],["falling",530,537],["overshadow",893,903],["shroud",945,951],["haze",971,975],["peculiar",994,1002],["cloud",1006,1011],["drawback",1639,1647],["strange",1910,1917],["fear",2101,2105]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",1544,1550]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",435,439],["opposite",758,766],["there",1868,1873],["there",2106,2111],["left",2124,2128],["there",2396,2401],["left",2416,2420]],"spa_preps":[["between",8,15],["below",263,268],["below",565,570],["above",737,742],["below",1051,1056],["close",1310,1315],["about",1671,1676],["over",1766,1770],["down",1846,1850],["through",2308,2315]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0135746606,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988558292},{"para_id":31,"paragraph":"Of the four roads which meet here, the one to his left would take him to Ambleside; the one opposite, to Troutbeck.

During the summer, two steamers make six trips each; so that the stranger can choose his own hour, and go down or up first, as he pleases. In accordance with the rule of lake approach, we should recommend his going down first. He embarks at the pier at Bowness, and is carried straight across to the Ferry, where the boats touch. Then the course is southwards, with the lake narrowing, and the hills sinking till the scenery becomes merely pretty. The water is very shallow towards the foot, and the practicable channel is marked out by posts. The best work that the whole neighbourhood could undertake would be the deepening of the lake at this part, and of the river which carries off the overflow. Not only is the passage of the steamers difficult: there is a far worse evil in the inundations which take place on all the low-lying lands, even up to Rydal, from the insufficiency of the outlet. The mischief has much increased since drainage has been introduced. The excellent and indispensible practice of land drainage must be followd up by an improvement in arterial drainage, or floods are inevitable. The water which formerly dribbled away in the course of many days, or even weeks, now gushes out from the drains all at once' and if the main outlets are not enlarged in proportion, the waters are thrown back upon the land. This is the case now in the neighbourhood of Windermere,-- the meadows and low-lying houses at Ambleside, a mile or two from the lake, being flooded every winter by the overflow of the lake first, then of the river, then of the tributary streams. The Steam Yacht Companies gave fifty pounds to have the lake deepend at Fell Foot, about five years ago; and Mr. White, the proprietor of the Newby Bridge Hotel, subscribed the same amount: and this was good as far as it went. But a much larger operation is required. There is a weir below Newby Bridge, to serve a corn mill. Now, the days of weirs and watermills are coming to an end. In these days of steam engines it is not to be endured that hundreds of acres should be turned into swamps, and hundreds of lives lost by fever, ague, and rheumatism, for the sake of a waterpower, which pays perhaps thirty or forty pounds a-year. We say this of watermills generally; and in regard to the need of sufficient arterial drainage, we speak of the shores of Windermere in particular. The expense of carrying off the utmost surplus of the waters in the wettest season would be presently repaid, here as anywhere else, by the improved value of the land and house property, relieved from the nuisance of flood.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Bowness",338,345],["Ferry",385,390],["Rydal",938,943],["Ambleside",1513,1522],["Newby Bridge",1807,1819],["Newby Bridge",1955,1967],["Windermere",2420,2430]],"geonouns":[["lake",59,63],["steamers",108,116],["lake",255,259],["pier",330,334],["boats",402,407],["lake",455,459],["hills",479,484],["water",537,542],["foot",571,575],["channel",597,604],["posts",622,627],["lake",718,722],["river",748,753],["steamers",817,825],["lands",920,925],["outlet",975,981],["land",1095,1099],["water",1198,1203],["outlets",1336,1343],["waters",1380,1386],["land",1412,1416],["meadows",1481,1488],["houses",1503,1509],["lake",1547,1551],["lake",1603,1607],["river",1627,1632],["streams",1656,1663],["lake",1721,1725],["shores",2410,2416],["waters",2500,2506],["land",2608,2612],["house",2617,2622]],"pos_words":[["pleases",215,222],["recommend",280,289],["pretty",525,531],["best",633,637],["work",638,642],["excellent",1055,1064],["improvement",1134,1145],["good",1868,1872],["regard",2342,2348],["sufficient",2364,2374],["improved",2586,2594]],"neg_words":[["stranger",150,158],["sinking",485,492],["shallow",551,558],["difficult",826,835],["worse",852,857],["evil",858,862],["lying",914,919],["insufficiency",954,967],["mischief",987,995],["inevitable",1182,1192],["drains",1300,1306],["lying",1497,1502],["lost",2181,2185],["fever",2189,2194],["nuisance",2651,2659]],"events":[],"dates":[["the summer",92,102],["many days",1250,1259],["weeks",1269,1274],["winter",1573,1579],["about five years ago",1748,1768],["the days",1996,2004],["these days",2054,2064],["forty",2277,2282],["a-year",2290,2296],["season",2522,2528]],"times":[["hour",178,182]],"distances":[["a mile",1524,1530]],"loc_advs":[["there",837,842],["here",2556,2560],["anywhere",2564,2572]],"spa_preps":[["down",191,195],["down",300,304],["across",371,377],["out",615,618],["away",1228,1232],["out",1287,1290],["below",1949,1954],["into",2146,2150]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0170212766,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9967106581},{"para_id":33,"paragraph":"The Swan Inn at Newby Bridge is exceedingly comfortable; and the charges are very moderate.

They ate little but oatmeal porridge; and, when that fell short, they tried Friar Tuck's ostensible diet of dried peas and hard beans. As they grew old, they began to feel the need of domestic help.

There are few objects more picturesque, to this day, than the huts of the woodcutters, who remain on a particular spot till their work is done. Upon piled stems of trees heather is heaped, to make a shaggy thatch; and when the smoke is oozing out, thin and blue, from the hole in the centre, or the children are about the fire in front, where the great pot is boiling, the sketcher cannot but stop and dash down the scene in his book.

The poor crazed survivor, his Kitty Dawson, went to that hut after the funeral, and would never leave it again. She did nothing but sit on that stone, or call his name through the wood. She was well cared for. There was always food in the hut, and some kind eye daily on the watch,-- though with care not to intrude. One day in winter, some sportsmen who were passing took the opportunity of leaving some provision in the hut. They became silent, and silenced their dogs. But she could never more be disturbed.

Its domains extended over the whole promontory in which it lies, and to the north, as far as the Shire Stones of Wrynose. They occupied the space between Windermere on the east and the Duddon on the west. The Abbot was a sort of king; and his abbey was enriched, not only by King Stephen, but by the gifts of neighbouring proprietors, who were glad to avail themselves, not only of its religious privileges, but of its military powers for the defence of their estates against border foes, and the outlaws of the mountains,-- the descendants of the conquered Saxons, who inherited their fathers' vengeance. The Abbey was first peopled from Normandy,-- a sufficient number of Benedictine monks coming over from the monestary of Savigny to establish this house in honour of St. Marye of Furness. In a few years their profession changed: they followed St. Bernard, and wore the white cassock, caul and scapulary, instead of the dress of the grey monks. It is strange now to see the railway traversing those woods where these grey-robed foreigners used to pass hither and thither, on their holy errands to the depressed and angry native Saxons dwelling round about. The situation of the Abbey, as is usual with religious houses, is fine. It stands in the depth of a glen, with a stream flowing by,-- the sides of the glen being clothed with wood. A beacon once belonged to it; a watch tower on an eminence accessible from the abbey, whose signal-fire was visible all over Low Furness, when assistance was required, or foes were expected. The building is of the pale red stone of the district. It must formerly have almost filled the glen: and the ruins gives an impression, to this day, of the establishment having been worthy of the zeal of its founder, King Stephen, and the extent of its endowments, which were princely. The boundary-wall of the precincts inclosed a space of sixty - five acres, over which are scattered remains that have, within our own time, been interpreted to be those of the mill, the granary, the fish-ponds, the ovens and kilns, and other offices. As for the architecture, the heavy shaft is found alternating with the clustered pillar, and the round Norman with the pointed Gothic arch. The masonry is so good that the remains are, even now, firm and massive; and the winding staircases within the walls are still in good condition in many places. The nobleness of the edifice consisted in its extent and proportions; for the stone would not bear the execution of any very elaborate ornament. The crowned heads of Stephen and his Queen Maude are seen outside the window of the Abbey, and are among the most interesting of the remains. It is all triste and the silent now. The chapter-house, where so many grave councils were held, is open to the babbling winds. Where the abbot and his train swept past in religious procession, over inscribed pavements, echoing to the tread, the stranger now wades among tall ferns and knotted grasses, stumbling over stones fallen from the place of honour. No swelling anthems are heard there now, or penitential psalms; but only the voice of birds, winds, and waters. But this blank is what the stranger comes for. Knowing what a territory the Abbots of Furness ruled over, like a kingdom, it is well to come hither to look how it is with that old palace and mitre, and to take one more warning of how Time shatters thrones, and dominations and powers, and causes the glories of the world to pass away.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["The Abbey",0,9],["Wrynose",147,154],["Windermere",188,198],["Duddon",219,225],["The Abbey",640,649],["Savigny",760,767],["Furness",818,825],["Abbey",1216,1221],["Furness",1505,1512],["Abbey",2634,2639],["Furness",3247,3254]],"geonouns":[["promontory",70,80],["abbey",277,282],["house",786,791],["railway",1012,1019],["woods",1037,1042],["pass",1085,1089],["houses",1250,1256],["glen",1295,1299],["stream",1308,1314],["glen",1346,1350],["wood",1370,1374],["beacon",1378,1384],["tower",1414,1419],["abbey",1455,1460],["building",1571,1579],["stone",1599,1604],["district",1612,1620],["glen",1662,1666],["wall",1866,1870],["winding",2325,2332],["walls",2355,2360],["stone",2483,2488],["heads",2562,2567],["house",2741,2746],["train",2843,2848],["stones",3009,3015],["waters",3153,3159],["pass",3485,3489]],"pos_words":[["glad",378,382],["sufficient",687,697],["holy",1119,1123],["fine",1261,1265],["eminence",1426,1434],["accessible",1435,1445],["worthy",1749,1755],["zeal",1763,1767],["good",2262,2266],["good",2374,2378],["interesting",2664,2675],["silent",2717,2723],["like",3267,3271],["well",3289,3293]],"neg_words":[["lies",93,97],["vengeance",629,638],["strange",989,996],["depressed",1139,1148],["angry",1153,1158],["pale",1590,1594],["ruins",1676,1681],["stranger",2937,2945],["knotted",2977,2984],["fallen",3016,3022],["swelling",3052,3060],["stranger",3188,3196],["warning",3380,3387]],"events":[],"dates":[["A.D. 1127",23,32],["a few years",830,841],["this day",1706,1714]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["hither",1090,1096],["within",2344,2350],["outside",2608,2615],["past",2855,2859],["there",3079,3084],["hither",3302,3308]],"spa_preps":[["over",55,59],["between",180,187],["against",502,509],["over",733,737],["round",1182,1187],["about",1188,1193],["over",1496,1500],["over",1928,1932],["within",1972,1978],["round",2201,2206],["among",2649,2654],["over",2885,2889],["among",2956,2961],["over",3004,3008],["over",3261,3265],["away",3490,3494]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0033898305,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974607229},{"para_id":43,"paragraph":"The stranger will be among the ruins late, by moon or by star light; and again in the morning, before the dew is off, and when the hidden violet perfumes the area where the censer once was swung, and where the pillars cast long shadows on the sward.

From Ulverstone, his road commands the estuary of the Leven for a few miles, and then approaches the foot of Coniston Water, which it reaches at eight miles from Ulverstone. Seven miles more bring him to the New Inn at Coniston, which, built under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Marshall, is one of the most comfortable hotels in England. This lake, like Windermere, is flanked by low hills at the south end, and inclosed by magnificent mountains at the head, where Mr. J.G. Marshall's house and lands are more gloriously situated than almost any other in the region. The little town of Church Coniston, and the New Inn, are a mile short of Waterhead; and the stranger must stop, and look through the place, while his early dinner is preparing. The Old Man, eleventh in height of the mountains of the district,( 2,576 feet) towers above him; and the abodes of the people will shew him that he is in the neighbourhood of a copper mine. There is one, some way up the mountain; and he may see the winding road up to it. Higher up, where there is an evident hollow, he is told that he would find a deep black tarn; and higher up, another. But to climb the mountain is a day's work, with much doubt of success,( that is, of a clear summit,) and he must to-day be satisfied with what is below. Yewdale, with its grey rocks, cushioned with heather up to their summits, stretches away northwards from the head of the lake, into a gorge where the mountains overlap. One of the crags there is called Raven Crag: and it is said that a pair of ravens is living now, there or somewhere near. It is to be hoped that, now the eagles are gone, the last ravens will not be destroyed or scared away by the shot of the miners, or other rash sportsmen, who are too apt to bring down every bird they see. There are many picturesque dwellings in the area which is between the heights and the lake: but the best view of these is from the point to which the stranger will proceed, after his lunch or early dinner. He must order his car to meet him in an hour at the junction of the two lake roads, on the Hawkshead road; and then he must walk a mile to Waterhead, and then on, round the head of the lake, in the direction of the Tent Lodge, which is see nestling in its garden at some elevation above the lake. The road passes the site of the former Waterhead inn, now a young plantation of Mr. Marshall's. Then, commanding the whole expanse of the lake, it begins to ascend, as it curves round to the east; and, at about a mile and three quarters from the new inn, there stands the house in which Elizabeth Smith lived and died; and, on the opposite side of the road, Tent Lodge, built on the spot where a tent was pitched, that she might draw her dying breath with greater ease, and enjoy, as long as possible, the incomparable landscape there stretched before her. The boat-house is at the bottom of the slope, down which she used to take her mother's guests; and she and her sister were so well practiced at the oar that they could show the beauties of the scene from any point of the lake. The first station is, however, from a field,-- the first beyond the new house on Coniston Bank. Some people think this the finest view in the whole district: and truly, the frequent visitor pronounces it incomparable, every time he comes; and the passing tourist feels that, once seen, it can never be forgotten. Nowhere else, perhaps, is the grouping of the mountain peaks, and the indication of their recesses so striking; and as to the foreground, with its glittering waterfall, its green undulations, its diversified woods, its bright dwellings, and its clear lake,-- it conveys the strongest impression of joyful charm,-- of fertility, prosperity and comfort, nestling in the bosom of the rarest beauty.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Coniston",12,20],["Windermere",75,85],["Duddon",94,100],["Furness Abbey",160,173],["Ulverstone",180,190],["Leven",229,234],["Coniston Water",284,298],["Ulverstone",337,347],["Coniston",394,402],["England",510,517],["Windermere",535,545],["Coniston",774,782],["Waterhead",821,830],["The Old Man",925,936],["Yewdale",1468,1475],["Raven Crag",1670,1680],["Hawkshead",2261,2270],["Waterhead",2309,2318],["Waterhead",2506,2515],["Mr. Marshall",2547,2559],["Elizabeth",2754,2763],["Coniston",3332,3340]],"geonouns":[["lake",4,8],["district",58,66],["road",196,200],["estuary",214,221],["foot",276,280],["hotels",500,506],["lake",524,528],["hills",565,570],["mountains",617,626],["head",634,638],["house",666,671],["lands",676,681],["region",740,746],["town",759,763],["mountains",964,973],["district",981,989],["towers",1004,1010],["mountain",1145,1153],["winding",1174,1181],["road",1182,1186],["tarn",1285,1289],["mountain",1332,1340],["summit",1407,1413],["rocks",1491,1496],["summits",1533,1540],["head",1577,1581],["lake",1589,1593],["mountains",1618,1627],["crags",1648,1653],["lake",2050,2054],["point",2095,2100],["junction",2222,2230],["lake",2242,2246],["roads",2247,2252],["road",2271,2275],["head",2343,2347],["lake",2355,2359],["lake",2461,2465],["road",2471,2475],["passes",2476,2482],["inn",2516,2519],["lake",2605,2609],["inn",2717,2720],["house",2739,2744],["road",2819,2823],["landscape",2986,2995],["boat",3028,3032],["house",3033,3038],["slope",3063,3068],["point",3232,3237],["lake",3245,3249],["station",3261,3268],["house",3323,3328],["district",3399,3407],["mountain",3610,3618],["peaks",3619,3624],["waterfall",3722,3731],["woods",3772,3777]],"pos_words":[["comfortable",488,499],["like",530,534],["magnificent",605,616],["gloriously",691,701],["work",1352,1356],["success",1377,1384],["clear",1401,1406],["satisfied",1438,1447],["picturesque",1979,1990],["best",2064,2068],["ease",2931,2935],["enjoy",2941,2946],["well",3150,3154],["finest",3374,3380],["striking",3666,3674],["diversified",3760,3771],["bright",3783,3789],["clear",3809,3814],["strongest",3838,3847],["joyful",3862,3868],["prosperity",3892,3902],["comfort",3907,3914],["beauty",3952,3958]],"neg_words":[["object",40,46],["stranger",840,848],["hollow",1234,1240],["doubt",1368,1373],["scared",1849,1855],["rash",1897,1901],["stranger",2114,2122],["died",2780,2784],["dying",2905,2910],["incomparable",2973,2985],["incomparable",3455,3467]],"events":[],"dates":[["a day",1344,1349],["to-day",1428,1434],["three quarters",2689,2703]],"times":[["an hour",2207,2214],["The first",3251,3260]],"distances":[["a few miles",239,250],["eight miles",320,331],["Seven miles",349,360],["a mile",805,811],["2,576 feet",992,1002],["a mile",2299,2305],["about a mile",2672,2684]],"loc_advs":[["there",1214,1219],["below",1461,1466],["northwards",1557,1567],["there",1654,1659],["there",1734,1739],["somewhere",1743,1752],["between",2022,2029],["there",2722,2727],["there",2996,3001],["beyond",3308,3314]],"spa_preps":[["between",67,74],["under",417,422],["through",869,876],["above",1011,1016],["away",1552,1556],["into",1595,1599],["near",1753,1757],["away",1856,1860],["down",1938,1942],["round",2333,2338],["above",2451,2456],["round",2645,2650],["opposite",2798,2806],["down",3070,3074]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0346820809,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984155893},{"para_id":45,"paragraph":"Retracing his steps for some way, and passing the turn which would lead him down again to Tent Lodge, the stranger has rather a steep ascent before him, from point to point of which he finds, on looking behind him, new views of the lake appearing, while the magnitude of the Old Man becomes more apparent as he recedes from it.

Elizabeth Smith lies buried there; and there is a tablet to her memory in the churchyard. At the ancient Grammar School of Hawkshead, Wordsworth and his brother were educated. Passing through the neat little town, the road turns to the left, to reach the northern end of Esthwaite water, which is two miles long, and half a mile broad;-- a quiet sheet of water, with two promontories stretching into it, which appear like islands, nearly dividing it into a chain of ponds. A round pond at the northern end of the lake, connected with it by a narrow creek, exhibits a strange phenoemenon. It has a floating island,-- not like that of Derwentwater, which is a mass of mud and vegetable tangle,-- but actually bearing trees: and this island is carried by strong winds from the one side to the other. The name of the pond is Priest's Pot: a fact which some explain by a tradition that a priest was drowned there; and others by a supposition of its holding about as much as a thirsty priest would like to drink, if the liquir were sufficiently good. Lakebank is a pretty place; and further on, Lakefield,( J. R. Ogden's, Esq.,) at Near Sawrey, commands perhaps the best view in the valley. Just beyond, the road turns to the left, through an undulating country of considerable beauty. We find a trace of the rebellion of 1745 in the name of a lane, called\" Scotch Gate\"( way.) It was here that the fearful Highlanders were looked for, on their march to Derby; and here they might have had all their own way if they had come; for Sawrey had no idea of showing fight. All the inhabitants, carrying all their valuables, hied away, and took refuge together in a solitary building which was called Cook's braw bog-house. And braw it must have been, to hold all the Sawreyans. The view of Windermere from the highest point is very fine. The road leads through Farther Sawrey to the Ferry House. If there is daylight left,( and there may be, as the Ferry is only seven miles from Coniston Waterhead) the traveller may as well go to the Station House, which he must have seen from the opposite side of the lake, peeping out of the ever-green woods. There he obtains fine views, up and down the lake, and may mark, on the way up, the largest laurels he has ever seen. His driver, or some resident, will probably take care that he does not stay till it is more than reasonably dusk. As reasons in plenty are always found for not marrying on a Friday, so it is said to be impossible, somehow or other, to get over to the Ferry Nab in the ferry-boat, except by daylight. And if you should arrive at the Nab too late, you may call all night for the boat, and it will not come. The traveller may judge for himself how much of the local tale may be true. He may probably have heard of the Crier of Claife, whose fame has spread far beyond the district: but if not, he should hear of the Crier now, while within sight of Ferry Nab. If he asks who or what the Crier was,-- that is precisely what nobody can tell, though every body would be glad to know: but we know all how and about it, except just what it really was. It gave its name to the place now called the Crier of the Claife,-- the old quarry in the wood, which no man will go near at midnight:--","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Hawkshead",21,30],["Esthwaite Water",170,185],["Elizabeth",192,201],["Hawkshead",315,324],["Wordsworth",326,336],["Esthwaite",463,472],["Derwentwater",825,837],["Sawrey",1323,1329],["Sawrey",1716,1722],["Windermere",1970,1980],["Sawrey",2049,2055],["Ferry",2063,2068],["Ferry",2129,2134],["Coniston Waterhead",2160,2178],["Ferry",2697,2702],["Ferry",3092,3097]],"geonouns":[["parish",4,10],["church",11,17],["church",92,98],["country",130,137],["valley",154,160],["town",400,404],["road",410,414],["water",473,478],["water",547,552],["promontories",563,575],["islands",614,621],["lake",705,709],["trees",907,912],["island",923,929],["valley",1369,1375],["road",1394,1398],["country",1440,1447],["lane",1530,1534],["building",1854,1862],["bog",1892,1895],["house",1896,1901],["point",1998,2003],["road",2022,2026],["lake",2285,2289],["woods",2321,2326],["lake",2373,2377],["ferry",2714,2719],["boat",2720,2724],["boat",2823,2827],["district",3015,3023],["quarry",3366,3372],["wood",3380,3384]],"pos_words":[["educated",358,366],["neat",388,392],["quiet",532,537],["like",609,613],["like",812,816],["strong",944,950],["like",1184,1188],["sufficiently",1218,1230],["good",1231,1235],["pretty",1251,1257],["best",1352,1356],["beauty",1464,1470],["fine",2012,2016],["leads",2027,2032],["well",2201,2205],["fine",2345,2349],["reasonably",2543,2553],["fame",2984,2988],["precisely",3151,3160],["glad",3210,3214]],"neg_words":[["lies",186,190],["lies",208,212],["strange",759,766],["fearful",1585,1592],["impossible",2648,2658]],"events":[],"dates":[["1745",1508,1512],["march",1631,1636],["Friday",2620,2626]],"times":[["dusk",2554,2558],["all night",2805,2814]],"distances":[["two miles",489,498],["half a mile",509,520],["only seven miles",2138,2154]],"loc_advs":[["there",220,225],["there",231,236],["left",428,432],["there",1094,1099],["beyond",1382,1388],["left",1412,1416],["here",1571,1575],["here",1651,1655],["together",1831,1839],["there",2079,2084],["left",2097,2101],["there",2108,2113],["opposite",2264,2272]],"spa_preps":[["through",376,383],["into",587,591],["into",642,646],["round",667,672],["about",1144,1149],["through",1418,1425],["away",1809,1813],["through",2033,2040],["out",2299,2302],["down",2364,2368],["over",2685,2689],["beyond",3004,3010],["within",3076,3082],["about",3248,3253],["near",3407,3411]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0479233227,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984622002},{"para_id":47,"paragraph":"It was about the time of the Reformation, one stormy night, when a party of travellers were making merry at the Ferry House,-- then a humble tavern,-- that a call for the boat was heard from the Nab. A quiet, sober boatman obeyed the call, though the night was wild and fearful. When he ought to be returning, the tavern guests stepped out upon the shore, to see whom he would bring. He returned alone, ghastly and dumb with horror. Next morning, he was in a high fever; and in a few days he died, without having been prevailed upon to say what he had seen at the Nab. For weeks after, there were shouts, yells, and howlings at the Nab, on every stormy night: and no boatman would attend to any call after dark. The Reformation had not penetrated the region; and the monk from Furness who dwelt on one of the islands of the lake, was applied to to exorcise the Nab. On Christmas day, he assembled all the inhabitants on Chapel Island, and performed in their presence services which should for ever confine the ghost to the quarry in the wood behind the Ferry, now called the Crier of Claife. Some say that the priest conducted the people to the quarry and laid the ghost,-- then and there. -- Laid though it be, nobody goes there at night. It is still told how the foxhounds in eager chase would come to a full stop at that place; and how, within the existing generation, a schoolmaster from Colthouse, who left home to pass the Crier, was never seen more.

The singular valley of Troutbeck was once a wooded basin, where the terrified Britons took refuge from the Romans, while the latter were making their great road from Kendal to Penrith, That road actually ran along the very ridge of the Troutbeck hills, as any one may see who will climb the mountain called, for this reason, High Street. What a sight it must have been-- the pioneers felling the trees, and paving the way, and the soldiers following, with their armour and weapons gleaming in the sun, while the trembling natives cowered in the forest below,-- listening now to the blows of the workmen, and now to the warlike music of the troops, marching up from Kendal! After Romans and Saxons were gone, the valley was a great park, and the inhabitants were virtually serfs, in danger of the gallows,( which had a hill to itself, named after it to this day) at the will and pleasure of the one great man. In course of time,-- that is, a good many centuries ago,-- the valley was disparked, and divided among the inhabitants,-- only one very large estate being left,-- the new park, containing 2,000 acres. This was the estate given by Charles I, to Huddlestone Phillipson, for his services in the civil wars. The valley now contains a string of hamlets,-- Town End, Town Head, High Green, Crag, and High Fold; and its farmsteads and outbuildings show some of the most curious speciments of ancient edifices that are to be seen in the district. Josiah Brown, whom we mentioned in connexion with Orrest Head, found nearly his match in oddity in this vale. A\" rum fellow\" in Troutbeck had a prodigious bull; and so had Josiah: and what must they do but meet half - way, and have a bull-fight; the terms being that the winner should have the fallen animal. Josiah actually came riding on his bull. The battle was tremendous; and the Troutbeck animal went down before Josiah's, and was given by him to the poor of Troutbeck. These anecdotes appear very strange to people who have lived in towns, or among the more level manners of the south: and this is why we relate them. They are among the curiosities of the district. Troutbeck is the most primitive of the frequented valleys of the distict. To find any other so antique and characteristic, it is necessary to leave the high road, and explore the secluded dales of which the summer tourist sees and hears nothing. The dale looks from the uplands as if it had been scooped out between the ridges with a gigantic scoop. Its levels are parcelled out into small fields, or all manner of shapes; and the stream,-- the beck abounding in trout,-- winds along the bottom, from the foot of High Street, to fall into the lake just by Calgarth.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Troutbeck",52,61],["Coniston",306,314],["Old Man",315,322],["Fairfield",326,335],["Troutbeck",360,369],["Kendal",503,509],["Penrith,",513,521],["Troutbeck",573,582],["High Street",662,673],["Kendal",1002,1008],["Crag",1630,1634],["Orrest",1835,1841],["Troutbeck",1913,1922],["Troutbeck",2170,2179],["Troutbeck",2250,2259],["Troutbeck",2458,2467],["High Street",2971,2982],["Calgarth",3014,3022]],"geonouns":[["country",4,11],["road",226,230],["lake",262,266],["mountains",291,300],["valley",350,356],["road",493,497],["road",527,531],["ridge",560,565],["hills",583,588],["mountain",628,636],["trees",733,738],["forest",882,888],["valley",1049,1055],["park",1068,1072],["hill",1155,1159],["valley",1309,1315],["park",1417,1421],["valley",1554,1560],["district",1775,1783],["vale",1889,1893],["towns",2325,2330],["district",2448,2456],["valleys",2508,2515],["road",2615,2619],["dales",2646,2651],["dale",2708,2712],["ridges",2778,2784],["fields",2848,2854],["beck",2903,2907],["foot",2963,2967],["lake",3001,3005]],"pos_words":[["wonderfully",187,198],["fine",199,203],["great",487,492],["great",1062,1067],["pleasure",1215,1223],["great",1235,1240],["good",1278,1282],["prodigious",1929,1939],["winner",2056,2062]],"neg_words":[["warlike",956,963],["danger",1119,1125],["oddity",1874,1880],["fallen",2079,2085],["poor",2242,2246],["strange",2289,2296],["primitive",2480,2489],["fall",2987,2991]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year",172,180],["this day",1189,1197],["many centuries",1283,1297],["the summer",2661,2671]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",2766,2773]],"spa_preps":[["along",545,550],["among",1343,1348],["down",2192,2196],["among",2335,2340],["among",2419,2424],["out",2762,2765],["out",2833,2836],["into",2837,2841],["along",2936,2941],["into",2992,2996]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0036900369,"vader_sentiment":0.21,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987449646},{"para_id":53,"paragraph":"The road now followed by the tourist descends into the vale sharply, by the abode of John Wilson, Esq., at The How, and crosses the bridge, in full view of the chapel, which was consecrated in 1562, and thoroughly repaired in 1828.

The head of Windermere lies like a pond below: the little Blelham tarn, near Wray Castle, glitters behind; and range beyond range of hills recedes to the horizon. Near at hand, all is very wild. The Ambleside road winds up steeply between grey rocks and moorland pasture, and dashing streams; and the Kirkstone mountain has probably mists driving about its head. There is something wilder to come, however,-- the noted Kirkstone Pass,-- the great pass of the district. The descent begings about a quarter of a mile beyond the house. Down plunges the road, with rock and torrent on either hand, and the bold sweeps of Coldfield and Scandale Screes shutting in the pass; and the little lake of Brothers' Water lying below, afar off among the green levels; and, closing in the whole in front, the mass of Place Fell,-- the other side of which goes sheer down into Ullswater.

He won great glory: and at first his lady rejoiced fully in it: but he was so long in returning, and she heard so much of his deeds in behalf of distressed ladies, that doubts at the length stole upon her heart as to whether he still loved her. These doubts disturbed her mind in sleep: and she began to walk in her dreams, directing her steps towards the waterfall where she and her lover used to meet. Under a holly tree beside the fall they had plighted their vows, and this was the limit of her dreaming walks. The knight at length returned to claim her. Arriving in the knight, he went to the ravine to rest under the holly until the morning should permit him to knock at the gate of the tower: but he saw a gliding white figure among the trees: and this figure reached the holly before him, and plucked twigs from the tree, and threw them into the stream. Was it the ghost of his lady love? or was it herself? She stood in a dangerous place: he put out his hand to uphold her: the touch awakened her. In her terror and confusion he fell from his grasp into the torrent, and was carried down the ravine. He followed and rescued her; but she died upon the bank; not, however, without having fully understood that her lover was true, and had come to claim her. The knight devoted the rest of his days to mourn her: he built himself a cell upon the spot, and became a hermit for her sake.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",566,576],["Greystoke",688,697]],"geonouns":[["stream",114,120],["bridge",141,147],["nook",224,228],["water",296,301],["line",447,451],["bridge",455,461],["fall",481,485],["tower",673,678],["waterfall",1080,1089],["tree",1142,1146],["gate",1405,1409],["tower",1417,1422],["trees",1468,1473],["tree",1548,1552],["stream",1578,1584],["bank",1884,1888]],"pos_words":[["led",11,14],["cool",214,218],["dashing",275,282],["loved",627,632],["win",713,716],["glory",717,722],["won",727,730],["great",731,736],["glory",737,742],["loved",958,963],["lover",1108,1113],["love",1615,1619],["uphold",1695,1701],["lover",1945,1950]],"neg_words":[["dies",308,312],["mournful",511,519],["distressed",869,879],["doubts",893,899],["stole",914,919],["doubts",975,981],["disturbed",982,991],["limit",1210,1215],["knock",1392,1397],["dangerous",1655,1664],["terror",1738,1744],["confusion",1749,1758],["fell",1762,1766],["torrent",1791,1798],["died",1870,1874],["mourn",2031,2036]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fall",186,194],["the fall",1154,1162],["his days",2019,2027]],"times":[["the morning",1359,1370]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",679,683],["without",1904,1911]],"spa_preps":[["over",15,19],["along",59,64],["above",95,100],["beside",1147,1153],["under",1337,1342],["among",1458,1463],["into",1569,1573],["out",1679,1682],["into",1782,1786],["down",1816,1820]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0106951872,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9934213758},{"para_id":58,"paragraph":"The visitor should ascend the steps and pathway from the bottom of the fall, and stand on the bridge that spans the leap.

On the left, is the valley or ravine of the Stock, whose waters are concealed by wood. The road runs along the slopes of the Scandale Fells. Below, Windermere opens more and more; and at length, the pretty little town of Ambleside appears, nestling at the foot of Wansfell, and the valley of the Rothay opens at the gazer's feet. On the opposite margin of this green recess, and on the skirts of Loughrigg, he sees Fox How, the residence and favourite retirement of the late Dr. Arnold, and now inhabited by his family. Near the pass which opens between Loughrigg and Fairfield, he is told that the residence of Wordsworth may be seen from below. Just under him to the left is the old church; and near the centre of the valley is the new church,-- more of a blemish than an adornment, unhappily, from its size and clumsiness, and the bad taste of its architecture. Though placed in a valley, it has a spire,-- the appropriate form of churches in a level country; and the spire is of a different color from the rest of the building; and the east window is remarkably ugly. There have been various reductions of the beauty of the valley within twenty years or so; and this latest is the worst, because the most conspicuous. The old church, though not beautiful, is suitable to the position, and venerable by its ancient aspect. It is abundantly large enough for the place, except for a few weeks in summer: but its burial ground, inclosed by roads on three sides, has for many years been overcrowded. Ten years ago, the state of the churchyard, and the health of the people who lived near it, was such as to make the opening of a new burial-ground a pressing matter; and hence, no doubt, arose the new church, though a larger and more beautiful cemetry might easily have been formed in the neighbourhood.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Troutbeck",101,110],["Ambleside",155,164],["Windermere",368,378],["Ambleside",441,450],["Wansfell",484,492],["Rothay",516,522],["Loughrigg",616,625],["Fox How",635,642],["Loughrigg",774,783],["Fairfield",788,797],["Wordsworth",832,842]],"geonouns":[["house",7,12],["top",21,24],["pass",32,36],["road",111,115],["house",213,218],["valley",240,246],["waters",277,283],["wood",301,305],["road",311,315],["slopes",331,337],["town",433,437],["foot",476,480],["valley",502,508],["feet",544,548],["residence",648,657],["pass",749,753],["residence",819,828],["church",905,911],["valley",940,946],["valley",1104,1110],["churches",1154,1162],["country",1174,1181],["building",1242,1250],["valley",1348,1354],["church",1450,1456],["ground",1640,1646],["roads",1660,1665],["ground",1859,1865],["church",1920,1926]],"pos_words":[["mercy",66,71],["pretty",419,425],["appropriate",1134,1145],["remarkably",1275,1285],["beauty",1334,1340],["beautiful",1469,1478],["suitable",1483,1491],["enough",1569,1575],["beautiful",1953,1962]],"neg_words":[["blemish",978,985],["unhappily",1005,1014],["bad",1054,1057],["ugly",1286,1290],["worst",1405,1410],["conspicuous",1429,1440],["doubt",1899,1904]],"events":[],"dates":[["twenty years",1362,1374],["a few weeks",1602,1613],["summer",1617,1623],["many years",1690,1700],["Ten years ago",1719,1732]],"times":[],"distances":[["four miles",193,203]],"loc_advs":[["left",123,127],["left",227,231],["left",889,893],["near",1802,1806]],"spa_preps":[["between",175,182],["along",321,326],["opposite",557,565],["between",766,773],["below",860,865],["under",872,877],["near",917,921],["within",1355,1361]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0114942529,"vader_sentiment":-0.87,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981574416},{"para_id":61,"paragraph":"The descent to all the Ambleside inns is steep,-- past the old church, and through a narrow street, and into the space dignified with the name of the market-place, and actually exhibiting an ancient market-cross. Half - a-dozen of the few shops of the town are in or about the market-place, and the Salutation and Commercial Inns and the White Lion,-- the three principal inns, are all conspicuous in it. If his time in Ambleside is precious, the stranger may use the sunset or twilight hour for seeing Stockghyll Force, while his supper is preparing. He is directed or guided through the stable-yard of the Salutation Inn, when he passes under a tall grove of the old trees on the right hand, the stream being on the left. On the opposite bank is the bobbin-mill, the one industrial establishment of Ambleside, placed there on account of the abundant supply of coppice wood obtainable in the neighbourhood. The stacks of wood are seen, high up on the bank; and the ivy-clad dwelling of the proprietor; and then the great water-wheel, with its attendant spouts and weir, and sound of gushing and falling waters. Where the path forks towards and away from the stream, the visitor must take the left-hand one. The other is the way up Wansfell. His path leads him under trees, and up and through a charming wood, with the water dashing and brawling further and further below, till his ear catches the sound of the fall: and presently after, the track turns to the left, and brings him to a rocky station whence he has a full view of the force. It is the fashion to speak lightly of this waterfall,-- it being within half - a-mile of the inn, and so easily reached; but it is, in our opinion, a very remarkable fall,( from the symmetry of its parts,) and one of the most graceful that can be seen. Its leap, of about seventy feet, is split by a rocky protrusion, and intercepted by a ledge running across; so that there are four falls,-- two smaller ones above, answering precisely to each other, and two larger leaps below, no less exactly resembling. The rock which parts them is feathered with foliage; and so are the sides of the ravine. Below, the waters unite in a rocky basin, whence they flow down to the mill, and on in a most picturesque torrent, through a part of Ambleside, and into the meadows, where they make their last spring down a rock near Miller Bridge, and join the Rothay about a mile from the lake.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",23,32],["Ambleside",420,429],["Salutation Inn",608,622],["Ambleside",801,810],["Wansfell",1232,1240],["Ambleside",2271,2280],["Rothay",2383,2389]],"geonouns":[["inns",33,37],["church",63,69],["street",92,98],["market",150,156],["market",199,205],["town",252,256],["market",277,283],["inns",372,376],["passes",632,638],["grove",652,657],["trees",669,674],["stream",698,704],["bank",740,744],["coppice",862,869],["wood",870,874],["wood",922,926],["bank",952,956],["water",1022,1027],["waters",1104,1110],["path",1122,1126],["stream",1159,1165],["path",1246,1250],["trees",1267,1272],["wood",1304,1308],["water",1319,1324],["track",1442,1447],["station",1493,1500],["force",1534,1539],["inn",1634,1637],["rock",2053,2057],["waters",2149,2155],["meadows",2295,2302],["rock",2345,2349],["lake",2412,2416]],"pos_words":[["dignified",119,128],["precious",433,441],["stable",589,595],["right",682,687],["abundant",843,851],["obtainable",875,885],["great",1016,1021],["leads",1251,1256],["charming",1295,1303],["dashing",1325,1332],["remarkable",1696,1706],["graceful",1767,1775],["precisely",1968,1977],["picturesque",2232,2243]],"neg_words":[["conspicuous",386,397],["stranger",447,455],["falling",1096,1103],["rocky",1487,1492],["fall",1707,1711],["split",1830,1835],["rocky",1841,1846],["rocky",2167,2172],["torrent",2244,2251]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fall",1407,1415],["last spring",2326,2337]],"times":[["twilight hour",478,491]],"distances":[["half - a-mile",1613,1626],["about seventy feet",1807,1825],["about a mile",2390,2402]],"loc_advs":[["past",50,54],["left",718,722],["there",819,824],["left",1193,1197],["below",1366,1371],["left",1461,1465],["across",1894,1900],["there",1910,1915],["below",2014,2019],["near",2350,2354]],"spa_preps":[["through",75,82],["into",104,108],["about",267,272],["through",577,584],["under",639,644],["opposite",731,739],["away",1145,1149],["under",1261,1266],["through",1285,1292],["within",1606,1612],["above",1951,1956],["down",2197,2201],["through",2253,2260],["into",2286,2290],["down",2338,2342]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0248756219,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9958385229},{"para_id":62,"paragraph":"Supposing the excursion to Patterdale to be left for another day, the stranger will see, after turning into the Ambleside road from Bowness, first, Ibbotsholme, on the right, the residence of Samuel Taylor, Esq., just beyond Troutbeck Bridge.

It is more likely, however, to be rippled by some breeze, and to show how deeply blue, or darkly grey, these mountain tarns may be. This is Loughrigg tarn, well known to all readers of Wordsworth. At some little distance beyond it, the stranger must diverge from his road to visit High Close, and see the view which is reputed the finest in Westmorland. He may leave his car where the road to High Close ascends to the left, and walk to the farm-house at the top. As there are probably lodgers, he had better not present himself at the garden door, but go on to the farmyard gate, pass through the yard to the field, and walk along the brow till he reaches the grey stone bench. There he is! overlooking\" the finest view in Westmorland.\" To the extreme right, Bowfell closes in the Langdale valley, the head of which is ennobled by the masses of the Pikes. A dark cleft in the nearer one is the place where the celebrated Dungeon Ghyll Force is plunging and foaming, beyond the reach of eye and ear. He can gather from this station, something of the character of Langdale. It has levels, here expanding, there contracting; and the stream winds among them from end to end. There is no lake: and the mountains send out spurs, alternating or meeting, so as to make the levels sometimes circular and sometimes winding. The dwellings are on the rising grounds which skirt the levels; and this, together with the paving of the road below, shows that the valley is subject to floods. The houses, of grey-stone, each on its knoll, with a canopy of firs and sycamores above it, and ferns scattered all around, and ewes and lambs nestling near it,-- these primitive farms are cheerful and pleasant objects to look upon, whether from above or passing among them. Nearer at hand are some vast quarries of blue slate. Below, among plantations, are seen the roofs of the Elterwater Powder Mills; whence the road winds through the village of Langdale Chapel, to the margin of the pools which make up the lake. From their opposite shore rise the hills, height above height,-- range beyond range. To the left lies Loughrigg tarn, and, in the distance, Windermere, with Wray Castle prominent on its height, and the Lancashire hills closing in the view. It is a singular prospect, at once noble and lovely; and the comfortable lodgings at High Close farm are in the request accordingly.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Brathay",96,103],["Skelwith Fold",121,134],["Skelwith Bridge",335,350],["Skelwith",458,466],["Langdale Pikes",629,643],["Grasmere",921,929],["Brathay",951,958],["Troutbeck",1080,1089],["Loughrigg",1541,1550],["Wordsworth",1586,1596],["High Close",1682,1692],["Westmorland",1742,1753],["High Close",1794,1804],["Westmorland",2125,2136],["Bowfell",2161,2168],["Langdale",2183,2191],["Pikes",2251,2256],["Langdale",2464,2472],["Elterwater",3258,3268],["Langdale Chapel",3328,3343],["Loughrigg",3498,3507],["Windermere",3536,3546],["Castle",3558,3564],["Lancashire",3598,3608],["High Close",3721,3731]],"geonouns":[["road",4,8],["bank",84,88],["field",191,196],["gate",197,201],["point",227,232],["valley",275,281],["gap",375,378],["wall",386,390],["field",419,424],["track",425,430],["rock",588,592],["wood",597,601],["pass",687,691],["bridge",701,707],["coppice",773,780],["wood",781,785],["valley",872,878],["valley",959,965],["road",977,981],["water",1269,1274],["mountain",1510,1518],["tarn",1551,1555],["road",1668,1672],["road",1786,1790],["farm",1842,1846],["house",1847,1852],["top",1860,1863],["door",1944,1948],["gate",1976,1980],["pass",1982,1986],["field",2011,2016],["brow",2037,2041],["stone",2067,2072],["valley",2192,2198],["head",2204,2208],["station",2425,2432],["stream",2532,2538],["lake",2585,2589],["mountains",2599,2608],["winding",2707,2714],["grounds",2748,2755],["road",2822,2826],["valley",2849,2855],["houses",2882,2888],["stone",2898,2903],["farms",3057,3062],["quarries",3182,3190],["road",3294,3298],["village",3317,3324],["lake",3390,3394],["shore",3416,3421],["hills",3431,3436],["tarn",3508,3512],["hills",3609,3614],["farm",3732,3736]],"pos_words":[["right",78,83],["right",209,214],["finest",256,262],["aver",489,493],["perfect",518,525],["right",832,837],["leading",1026,1033],["right",1219,1224],["calm",1300,1304],["breeze",1451,1457],["well",1557,1561],["finest",1732,1738],["better",1903,1909],["finest",2110,2116],["right",2154,2159],["celebrated",2312,2322],["cheerful",3067,3075],["pleasant",3080,3088],["prominent",3565,3574],["noble",3671,3676],["lovely",3681,3687],["comfortable",3697,3708]],"neg_words":[["abruptly",30,38],["stranger",146,154],["rocky",221,226],["torrent",725,732],["steep",971,976],["primitive",1058,1067],["miss",1329,1333],["strike",1385,1391],["stranger",1637,1645],["dark",2260,2264],["primitive",3047,3056],["lies",3493,3497]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fall",552,560],["to-day",1169,1175],["the day",1289,1296]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",398,402],["behind",644,650],["beneath",733,740],["home",899,903],["left",989,993],["left",1820,1824],["there",1868,1873],["here",2489,2493],["there",2505,2510],["below",2827,2832],["above",3445,3450],["left",3488,3492]],"spa_preps":[["away",63,67],["through",181,188],["through",363,370],["close",576,581],["over",692,696],["out",940,943],["round",1163,1168],["beyond",1622,1628],["through",1987,1994],["along",2027,2032],["beyond",2368,2374],["among",2545,2550],["out",2614,2617],["together",2790,2798],["above",2960,2965],["around",2994,3000],["near",3030,3034],["above",3124,3129],["among",3141,3146],["among",3213,3218],["through",3305,3312],["opposite",3407,3415],["beyond",3467,3473]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0297619048,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9942013621},{"para_id":68,"paragraph":"The car is waiting where the traveller left it; but he had better walk for half - a-mile or so,-- the descent of Red Bank being very steep. The great mountain that swells so grandly above the rest before him is Helvellyn. The lake that opens below is Grasmere, with its one island, made up of green slope, black fir clump, and grey barn. At the further end lies the village, with its old square church tower, beneath whose shadow Wordsworth is buried. The white road that winds like a ribbon up and up the gap between Helvellyn and the opposite fells is the mail road to Keswick, and the gap is Dunmail Raise. The remarkable and beautiful hill behind the village is Helm Crag; and its rocky crest forms the group called the Lion and the Lamb. The long white house, near the foot go Helvellyn, is the Swan Inn, whence Scott, Southey, and Wordsworth, set forth on ponies for the ascent of the mountain: and behind it rises the path by which pedestrians come from Grasmere to Patterdale, by the margin of Grisedale tarn,-- the mountain tarn of the wild boar, as the words properly signify. To the left of Helm Crag, a deep valley evidently opens. That is Easedale; and there our Tourist is to go to-day. Meantime, let him linger awhile, that he may learn by heart every feature of this gay and lovely scene. The lane he has just passed to the right leads him to the grassy bridle-road called Loughrigg Terrace, whence the best views are obtained of both Grasmere and Rydal lakes, and which leads along the uplands and then by Rydal Lake back to the valley of the Rothay. We must leave it now, and plunge down Red Bank, which has the characteristics of a Norwegian road. At the cistern at the bottom, the stranger enters his car, and passes farm houses between him and the lake, and villas on the rocky and wooded bank on the left; and, at the corner, where the road turns to the village, the cluster of lodging-houses, called St. Oswald's, where the Hydropathic Establishment struggled on for a time, but found the Westmorland winters too long for invalids.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Red Bank",113,121],["Helvellyn",211,220],["Grasmere",251,259],["Wordsworth",430,440],["Helvellyn",518,527],["Keswick",571,578],["Dunmail Raise",595,608],["Helm Crag",666,675],["Helvellyn",782,791],["Wordsworth",837,847],["Grasmere",961,969],["Patterdale",973,983],["Grisedale",1002,1011],["Helm Crag",1102,1111],["Easedale",1152,1160],["Loughrigg",1389,1398],["Grasmere",1451,1459],["Rydal",1464,1469],["Rydal Lake",1523,1533],["Rothay",1560,1566],["Red Bank",1606,1614],["Westmorland",2012,2023]],"geonouns":[["mountain",150,158],["lake",226,230],["island",274,280],["slope",299,304],["village",366,373],["church",395,401],["tower",402,407],["road",462,466],["gap",506,509],["road",563,567],["gap",588,591],["hill",639,643],["village",655,662],["house",758,763],["foot",774,778],["mountain",891,899],["path",925,929],["mountain",1024,1032],["tarn",1033,1037],["valley",1120,1126],["lane",1309,1313],["road",1377,1381],["lakes",1470,1475],["valley",1546,1552],["road",1661,1665],["passes",1730,1736],["farm",1737,1741],["houses",1742,1748],["lake",1769,1773],["bank",1810,1814],["road",1858,1862],["village",1876,1883],["houses",1908,1914]],"pos_words":[["better",59,65],["great",144,149],["like",478,482],["remarkable",614,624],["beautiful",629,638],["properly",1069,1077],["lovely",1291,1297],["right",1340,1345],["leads",1346,1351],["best",1419,1423],["leads",1487,1492]],"neg_words":[["steep",133,138],["lies",357,361],["rocky",685,690],["wild",1045,1049],["stranger",1701,1709],["rocky",1793,1798],["struggled",1973,1982]],"events":[["the Swan Inn",796,808]],"dates":[["to-day",1193,1199],["winters",2024,2031]],"times":[],"distances":[["half - a-mile",75,88]],"loc_advs":[["left",39,43],["above",182,187],["below",242,247],["between",510,517],["near",765,769],["behind",905,911],["left",1094,1098],["there",1166,1171],["between",1749,1756],["left",1822,1826]],"spa_preps":[["beneath",409,416],["opposite",536,544],["behind",644,650],["along",1493,1498],["down",1601,1605]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0203045685,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9868195057},{"para_id":69,"paragraph":"The driver must stop at the Red Lion, to order dinner. It is an old-fashion little place, where the traveller's choice is usually between ham and eggs and eggs and ham; with the addition, however, of cheese and oat cake. He goes to the Red Lion now merely because it is on the way to his destination. If he were going to stay at Grasmere, he would take up his abode at the Hotel kept by Mr. Brown. The beauty of the view from that house is evident at a glance; and good accommodations will be found within, with ample means of conveyance of all kinds. Whatever the dinner at the Red Lion is to be, it must not be ready under two or three hours;-- rather three than two. He proceeds for a mile between fences before he reaches the opening of Easedale. The gate and shrubbery to the right are the entrance to Lady Richardson's cottage; and there the regular road ends. The car can go about a mile further along the farm tracks in the valley, through the meadows which yield a coarse hay, and near the stream which is tufted with alders. At the farm house where the car stops, the people will shew the stranger the way he must go,-- past the plantation, and up the hill side, where he will find the track that will guide him up to the waterfall,-- the foaming cataract which is seen all over the valley, and is called Sour Milk Ghyll Force. The water and the track together will shew him the way to the tarn, which is the source of the stream. Up and on he goes, over rock and through wet moss, with long stretches of dry turf and purple heather; and at last, when he is heated and breathless, the dark cool recess opens in which lies Easedale Tarn. Perhaps there is an angler standing besides the great boulder on the brink. Perhaps there is a shepherd lying among the ferns. But more probably the stranger finds himself perfectly alone. There is perhaps nothing in natural scenery which conveys such an impression of stillness as tarns which lie under precipices: and here the rocks sweep down to the brink almost round the entire margin. For hours together the deep shadows move only like the gnomon of the sundial; and, when movement occurs, it is not such as disturbs the sense of repose;-- the dimple made by a restless fish or fly, or the gentle flow of water in or out; or the wild drake and his brood, paddling so quietly as not to break up the mirror, or the reflection of some touch of sunlight, or passing shadow. If there is commotion from gusts or eddies of wind, the effect is even more remarkable. Little white clouds are driven against the rocks,-- the spray is spilled in unexpected places; now the precipices are wholly veiled, and there is nothing but the ruffled water to be seen: and again, in an instant, the rocks are disclosed so fearfully that they seem to be crowding together to crush the intruder. If this seems to the inexperienced like extravagance, let him go alone to Easedale Tarn, or to Angle Tarn on Bowfell, on a gusty day, and see what he will find.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Red Lion",28,36],["Red Lion",236,244],["Grasmere",329,337],["Red Lion",579,587],["Easedale",741,749],["Easedale Tarn",1632,1645],["Easedale Tarn",2898,2911],["Angle Tarn",2919,2929],["Bowfell",2933,2940]],"geonouns":[["house",431,436],["gate",755,759],["entrance",795,803],["cottage",825,832],["road",856,860],["farm",913,917],["tracks",918,924],["valley",932,938],["meadows",952,959],["stream",999,1005],["farm",1042,1046],["house",1047,1052],["hill",1162,1166],["track",1196,1201],["cataract",1257,1265],["valley",1293,1299],["water",1342,1347],["track",1356,1361],["tarn",1400,1404],["stream",1433,1439],["rock",1465,1469],["precipices",1951,1961],["rocks",1976,1981],["water",2258,2263],["precipices",2614,2624],["water",2681,2686],["rocks",2729,2734]],"pos_words":[["beauty",402,408],["good",465,469],["ample",512,517],["ready",613,618],["right",781,786],["cool",1600,1604],["great",1695,1700],["perfectly",1819,1828],["like",2084,2088],["gentle",2243,2249],["remarkable",2499,2509],["like",2859,2863]],"neg_words":[["coarse",974,980],["stranger",1099,1107],["dark",1595,1599],["lies",1627,1631],["lying",1751,1756],["stranger",1796,1804],["lie",1941,1944],["restless",2214,2222],["wild",2282,2286],["brood",2301,2306],["break",2338,2343],["commotion",2435,2444],["unexpected",2587,2597],["fearfully",2752,2761],["crush",2804,2809],["inexperienced",2845,2858],["extravagance",2864,2876]],"events":[],"dates":[["a gusty day",2945,2956]],"times":[["hours",2042,2047]],"distances":[["a mile",686,692],["about a mile",882,894]],"loc_advs":[["between",130,137],["there",838,843],["past",1130,1134],["together",1362,1370],["there",1655,1660],["there",1731,1736],["here",1967,1971],["there",2426,2431],["there",2648,2653]],"spa_preps":[["within",499,505],["under",619,624],["between",693,700],["along",903,908],["through",940,947],["near",990,994],["over",1284,1288],["over",1460,1464],["through",1474,1481],["among",1757,1762],["under",1945,1950],["down",1988,1992],["round",2013,2018],["together",2048,2056],["out",2270,2273],["against",2542,2549],["together",2792,2800]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0184501845,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":-0.971416533},{"para_id":70,"paragraph":"After his return to the Red Lion, and his dinner, the stranger will go to the churchyard.

Several good houses have sprung up near it, within a few years. The promontory which here causes the lake to contract to the little river( which is called the Rothay in all the intervals of the chain of lakes,) may be passed in three ways. The mail road runs round its point, and therefore keeps besides the water;-- the Roman road, where the Wishing Gate used to be, crosses it by a rather steep ascent and descent;-- and a shorter road still, steep and boggy, cuts across its narrowest part, and comes out at the Rydal Quarries. Our traveller will take the mail road, probably. It will soon bring him to Rydal Lake; and he cannot but think the valley very lovely in the summer afternoon. On the opposite side of the lake is Loughrigg, with its terrace-walk distinctly visible half - way up. The islands are wooded; and on one of them is a heronry; and the grey bird, with its long flapping wings, is most likely visible, either in flight, or perched on a tree near its nest, or fishing in the shallows. Nab Scar, the blunt end of Fairfield, which overlooks the roaa and the lake, is very fine with its water-worn channels, its wood, and grey rocks. Nab Cottage, the humble white house by the road side, and on the margin of the lake, is the place where Hartley Coleridge lived and died.

The Nook is a farmhouse is a glorious situation as he will see when he gets there and steps into the field on the left, to look abroad from the brow. He then passes under its old trees to where the voice of falling waters calls him onward. Scandale Beck comes tumbling down its rocky channel, close at hand. He must cross the bridge, and follow the cart-road, which brings him out at once upon the fells. What he has to aim at is the ridge above Rydal forest or park, from whence his way is plain,-- round the whole cul-de-sac of Fairfield, to Nab Scar. He sees it all; and the only thing is to do it: and we know of no obstacle to his doing it, unless it be the stone wall which divides the Scandale from the Rydal side of the ridge. These stone walls are an inconvenience to pedestrians, and a great blemish in the eyes of strangers. In the first place, however, it is to be said that an open way is almost invariably left, up every mountain, if the rover can but find it; and, in the next place, the ugliness of these climbing fences disappears marvellously when the stranger learns how they came there. -- In the old times, when there were wolves, and when the abbots of the surrounding Norman monasteries encouraged their tenants to approach nearer and nearer to the Saxon fastnesses, the shepherds were allowed to inclose crofts about their hillside huts, for the sake of browsing their flocks on the sprouts of the ash and holly with which the hillsides were then wooded, and of protecting the sheep from the wolves which haunted the thickets. The inclosures certainly spread up the mountain sides, at this day, to a height where they would not be seen if ancient custom had not drawn the lines which are thus preserved; and it appears, from historical testimony, that these fences existed before the fertile valleys were portioned out among many holders. Higher and higher ran these stone inclosures,-- threading the woods, and joining on upon the rocks. Now, the woods are for the most part gone; and the walls offend and perplex the stranger's eye and mind by their unsightliness and apparent uselessness; but it is a question whether, their origin once known, they would be willingly parted with,-- reminding us as they do of the times when the tenants of the abbots or military nobles formed a link between the new race of inhabitants and the Saxon remnant of the old. One of these walls it is which runs along the ridge and bounds Rydal Park. There may be a gate in it; or one which enables the stranger to get round it. If not, he must get over it; and, if he does so, high enough up, it may save him another climb. The nearer the ridge, the fewer the remaining walls between him and liberty. Once in the forest, Christopher North's advice comes into his mind,-- unspoiled by the fear, only too reasonable in the lower part of the park,-- of being turned out of the paradise, very summarily. \" The sylvan, or rather, the forest scenery of Rydal Park,\" says Professor Wilson,\" was, in the memory of living man, magnificent; and it still contains a treasure of old trees. By all means wander away into these old woods, and lose yourself for an hour or two among the cooing of cushats and the shrill shrick of startled blackbirds, and the rustle of the harmless glow-worm among the last year's beech leaves. No very great harm should you even fall asleep under the shadow of an oak, whilst the magpie chatters at safe distance, and the more innocent squirrel peeps down upon you from a bough of the canopy, and then, hoisting his tail, glides into the obscurity of the loftiest umbrage.\"-- Ascending from these shades through a more straggling woodland, the stranger arrives at a clump on the ridge,-- the last clump, and thenceforth feels himself wholly free. His foot is on the spring mountain moss; and many a cushion of heather tempts him to sit down and look abroad. There may still be a frightened cow or two, wheeling away, with tail aloft, as he comes onwards; and a few sheep are still crouching in the shadows the rocks, or staring at him from the knolls. If he plays the child and bleats, he will soon see how many there are. It is one of the amusements of a good mimic in such places to bring about him all the animals there are, by imitating their cries.

An old shepherd has the charge of four rain guages which are set up on four ridges,-- desolte, misty spots, sometimes below and often above the clouds. He visits each once a month, and notes down what these guages record; and when the tall old man, with his staff, passes out of sight into the cloud, or among the cresting rocks, it is a striking thought that science has set up a tabernacle in these wildernesses, and found a priest among the shepherds. That old man has seen and heard wonderful things:-- has trod upon rainbows, and been waited upon by a dim retinue of spectral mists.

The first impression probably is of the billowy character of the mountain groups around and below him. This is perhaps the most striking feature of such a scene to a novice; and the next is the flitting character of the mists. One ghostly peak after another seems to rise out of its shroud; and then the shroud winds itself round another. Here the mist floats over a valley; there it rocks out of chasm: here it rests upon a green slope; there it curls up a black precipice. The sunny vales below look like a paradise, with their bright meadows and waters and shadowy woods, and little knots of villages. To the south there is the glittering sea; and the estuaries of the Leven and Duddon, with their stretches of yellow sands. To the east there is a sea of hill tops. On the north, Ullswater appears, grey and calm at the foot of black precipices; and near may be traced the whole pass from Patterdale, where Brothers' Water lies invisible from hence. The finest point of the whole excursion is about the middle of the cul-de-sac, where, on the northern sides, there are tremendous precipices, overlooking Deepdale, and other sweet recesses far below. Here, within heraing of the torrents which tumble from these precipices, the rover should rest. He will see nothing so fine as the contrast of this northern view with the long green slope on the other side, down to the source of Rydal Beck, and then down and down to Rydal Woods and Mount. He is now 2,950 feet above the sea level; and he has surely earned his meal. If the wind troubles him, he can doubtless find a sheltered place under a rock.

Waking out a reverie, an hour after dinner, he sees that the sun is some way down the western sky. He hastens on, not heeding the boddy spaces, and springing along the pathless heather and moss, seeing more and more lakes and tarns every quarter of an hour. In the course of the day he sees ten. Windermere, and little Blelham Tarn beyond, he saw first. Ullswater was below him to the north when he dined; and, presently after, a tempting path guided his eye to Grisedale Tarn, lying in the pass from Patterdale to Grasmere. Here are four. Next, comes Grasmere, with Easedale Tarn above it, in its mountain hollow: then Rydal, of course, at his feet; and Elterwater beyond the western ridges; and finally, to the south-west, Esthwaite Water and Coniston. There are the ten. Eight of these may be seen at once from at least one point-- Nab Scar, whence he must take his last complete; for from hence he must plunge down the steep slope, and bid farewell to all that lies behind the ridge. The day has gone like an hour. The sunshine is leaving the surface of the nearer lakes, and the purple bloom of the evening is on the further mountains; and the gushes of yellow light between the western passes show that sunset is near. He must hasten down,-- mindful of the opening between the fences, which he remarked from below, and which, if he finds, he cannot lose his way. He does not seriously lose his way, though crag and bog make him diverge now and then. Descending between the inclosures, he sits down once or twice, to relieve the fatigue to the ancle and instep of so continuous a descent, and to linger a little while over the beauty of the evening scene. As he comes down into the basin where Rydal Beck makes its last gambols and leaps, before entering the park, he is sensible of the approach of night. Loughrigg seems to rise: the hills seem to close him in, and the twilight to settle down. He comes to a gate, and finds himself in the civilised world again. He descends the green lane at the top of Rydal Mount, comes out just above Wordsworth's gate, finds his car at the bottom of the hill,--( the driver beginning to speculate on whether any accident has befallen the gentleman on the hills,)-- is driven hom, and is amazed, on getting out, to find how stiff and tired he is.

By some device or another, Scott managed to pay a daily visit to the Swan without his friends being aware of it.

No doubt he took the unlucky speech more serenely than his guest.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",14,23],["Grasmere",85,93],["Wordsworth",264,274],["Wordsworth",556,566],["Helvellyn",595,604],["Wordsworth",799,809]],"geonouns":[["road",4,8],["inn",121,124],["inn",141,144]],"pos_words":[["good",213,217],["humble",341,347]],"neg_words":[["fallen",46,52],["conspicuous",103,114],["troubled",828,836],["doubt",861,866],["unlucky",879,886]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",186,191],["early days",239,249],["daily",479,484],["today",737,742]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",503,510]],"spa_preps":[["under",53,58],["out",680,683]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0365853659,"vader_sentiment":-0.9,"roberta_sentiment":0.9953776598},{"para_id":88,"paragraph":"From the Swan, the road to Keswick ascends Dunmail Raise;-- a steep pitch of road, though its highest point is only 720 feet above the sea.

He may go up Helvellyn, or he may bowl along on the high road, straight through Legberthwaite, and immediately under Helvellyn; or he may go on foot, or on a pony, round the western side of the lake, which is known by the various names of Wythburn Water, Leathes Water, and Thirlmere. It is a choice of pleasures; and he will ascend Helvellyn hereafter, if he does not now. Of the two lake roads, the rude western one is unquestionably the finest. The woods, which were once so thick that the squirrel is said to have gone from Wythburn to Keswick without touching the ground, are cleared away now; and the only gloom in the scene is from the mass of Helvellyn. The stranger leaves the mail road within a mile of the Nag's Head, passes the cottages called by the boastful name of the City of Wythburn, and a few farm-houses, and soon emerging from the fences, finds himself on a grassy level under the Armboth Fells, within an amphitheatre of rocks, with the lake before him, and Helvellyn beyond, overshadowing it. The rocks behind are feathered with wood, except where a bold crag here, and a free cataract there introduces a variety. There is a clear pool in the midst of the grass, where, if the approaching tread be light, the heron may be seen fishing, or faithfully reflected in the mirror. The track leads by the margin of the lake, and through a shady lane, and a farm yard, to the bridge by which the lake is to be crossed. The water is shallow there, between two promontories; so that piers are easily built, with little wooden bridges at intervals: and thus is solved what is to novices a great mystery;-- how there can be a bridge over a lake. There is another mystery just behind, under the Armboth Fells,-- a haunted house. Lights are seen there at night, the people say; and the bells ring; and just as the bells all set off ringing, a large dog is seen swimming across the lake. The plates and dishes clatter; and the table is spread by unseen hands. That is the preparation for the ghostly wedding feast of a murdered bride, who comes up from her watery bed in the lake to keep her terrible nuptials. There is really something remarkable, and like witchery, about the house. On a bright moonlight night, the spectator who looks towards it from a distance of two or three miles, sees the light reflected from its windows into the lake; and, when a slight fog gives a reddish hue to the light, the whole might easily be taken for an illumination of a great mansion. And this mansion seems to vanish as you approach,-- being no mansion, but a small house lying in a nook, and overshadowed by a hill. The bridge being crossed, another bit of lane leads out upon the high road near the clean little inn, the King's Head, and within view of the vale of St. John.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Nag's Head",7,17],["Helvellyn",179,188],["Legberthwaite",246,259],["Helvellyn",283,292],["Wythburn Water",405,419],["Leathes Water",421,434],["Thirlmere",440,449],["Helvellyn",499,508],["Wythburn",694,702],["Keswick",706,713],["Helvellyn",817,826],["Nag's Head",883,893],["Wythburn",958,966],["Helvellyn",1146,1155],["St. John",2931,2939]],"geonouns":[["inn",30,33],["road",223,227],["foot",310,314],["lake",360,364],["lake",551,555],["roads",556,561],["woods",618,623],["ground",735,741],["road",857,861],["passes",895,901],["cottages",906,914],["farm",978,982],["houses",983,989],["rocks",1109,1114],["lake",1125,1129],["rocks",1186,1191],["wood",1218,1222],["crag",1244,1248],["cataract",1266,1274],["track",1468,1473],["lake",1501,1505],["lane",1527,1531],["farm",1539,1543],["bridge",1557,1563],["lake",1577,1581],["water",1604,1609],["promontories",1640,1652],["piers",1662,1667],["bridges",1705,1712],["bridge",1803,1809],["lake",1817,1821],["house",1898,1903],["lake",2056,2060],["table",2101,2106],["bed",2238,2241],["lake",2249,2253],["house",2352,2357],["lake",2513,2517],["mansion",2639,2646],["mansion",2657,2664],["mansion",2709,2716],["house",2730,2735],["nook",2747,2751],["hill",2775,2779],["bridge",2785,2791],["lane",2822,2826],["road",2851,2855],["inn",2878,2881],["vale",2923,2927]],"pos_words":[["unquestionably",587,601],["finest",606,612],["cleared",747,754],["free",1261,1265],["variety",1294,1301],["clear",1314,1319],["faithfully",1428,1438],["leads",1474,1479],["great",1767,1772],["remarkable",2311,2321],["like",2327,2331],["bright",2364,2370],["great",2633,2638],["leads",2827,2832],["clean",2865,2870]],"neg_words":[["rude",567,571],["gloom",778,783],["stranger",832,840],["boastful",929,937],["shady",1521,1526],["shallow",1613,1620],["mystery",1840,1847],["terrible",2266,2274],["lying",2736,2741]],"events":[],"dates":[["a-quarter",60,69]],"times":[["night",1930,1935],["night",2381,2386]],"distances":[["about a mile",43,55],["a mile",869,875],["two or three miles",2442,2460]],"loc_advs":[["without",714,721],["beyond",1156,1162],["here",1249,1253],["there",1275,1280],["there",1621,1626],["there",1788,1793],["there",1921,1926],["across",2045,2051],["near",2856,2860],["within",2904,2910]],"spa_preps":[["along",205,210],["through",238,245],["under",277,282],["round",330,335],["away",755,759],["within",862,868],["under",1058,1063],["within",1083,1089],["behind",1192,1198],["through",1511,1518],["between",1628,1635],["over",1810,1814],["behind",1853,1859],["under",1861,1866],["about",2342,2347],["into",2504,2508],["out",2833,2836]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0221402214,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.997643888},{"para_id":90,"paragraph":"One would like to know how often the Bridal of Triermain has been read within that vale. The Castle Rock, in its disenchanted condition, is a prominent object in approaching the vale from Legberthwaite, or by the road just described; and there are lights and gloomy moments in which it looks as like as may be to a scene of witchery,-- now engrossing the sunshine when the range to which it belongs is all in shadow; and now perversely gloomy, because there is a single cloud in the sky. The narrow vale is full of character and charm, from end to end; and at its northern extremity it comes out upon a spot of strong historical interest. The village of Threlkeld will, by its name, remind the traveller of the good Lord Clifford, the story of whose boyhood is familiar to all readers of Wordsworth. That place is, indeed, the refuge where the boy passed his shepherd life; and there is a local tradition that, though he never learned to read or write, during the twenty - four years that he spent in keeping sheep, his astronomical knowledge was considerable, and so interesting to him that he improved it by study after he came to his estates. The road through Threlkeld will, however, be followed by the traveller on another occasion, and not now: for he must not miss that view from Castlerigg, which made the poet Gray long to go back again to Keswick; and he will not, therefore, now pass through the vale. Within five miles from the peep into it, the view opens, which presently comprehends the whole extent from Bassenthwaite Lake to the entrance of Borrowdale,-- the plain between the two lakes of Bassenthwaite and Derwent Water, presenting one of the richest scenes in England,-- with the town of Keswick, and many a hamlet and farmstead besides; and the two churches,-- the long, white, old-fashioned Crosthwaite church, in which Southey is buried, and the new red-stone church of St. John, with its spire, and the school houses and pretty parsonage at hand. These were built by the late John Marshall, of Hallsteads,-- a name which is more spoiled than dignified by any conventional addition. The church and parsonage were occupied by the husband of one of his daughters; and now heand his son-in-law lie buried there together. Skiddaw is here the monarch of the scene. That mountain mass occupies the north of the view. Bassenthwaite lake peeps from behind it: then the plain of the Derwent stretches out to the lake of that name; and at the southern end the Borrowdale mountains are grouped with wonderful effect,-- Castle Crag occupying the most conspicuous place. On the eastern side, to the left of the spectator, Wallabarrow Crag rears its crest, and unfolds its woods below; while the opposite side of the lake is guarded by Cat Bells and other mountains, bare and pointed, and possessing a character of their own. A steep winding road descends into the valley; and at the foot of the hill lies Keswick.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Triermain",47,56],["Castle Rock",93,104],["Legberthwaite",188,201],["Threlkeld",654,663],["Wordsworth",788,798],["Threlkeld",1163,1172],["Castlerigg",1287,1297],["Keswick",1349,1356],["Bassenthwaite Lake",1520,1538],["Bassenthwaite",1607,1620],["Derwent Water",1625,1638],["Keswick",1708,1715],["Crosthwaite",1813,1824],["St. John",1893,1901],["Skiddaw",2241,2248],["Bassenthwaite",2334,2347],["Derwent",2397,2404],["Borrowdale",2473,2483],["Castle Crag",2531,2542],["Crag",2644,2648],["Cat Bells",2745,2754],["Keswick",2915,2922]],"geonouns":[["vale",83,87],["vale",178,182],["road",213,217],["vale",499,503],["village",643,650],["road",1150,1154],["pass",1390,1394],["vale",1407,1411],["entrance",1546,1554],["lakes",1598,1603],["town",1700,1704],["hamlet",1728,1734],["church",1825,1831],["stone",1877,1882],["church",1883,1889],["school",1927,1933],["houses",1934,1940],["church",2110,2116],["mountain",2288,2296],["lake",2348,2352],["lake",2426,2430],["mountains",2484,2493],["woods",2682,2687],["lake",2726,2730],["mountains",2765,2774],["winding",2843,2850],["road",2851,2855],["valley",2874,2880],["foot",2893,2897],["hill",2905,2909]],"pos_words":[["like",10,14],["prominent",142,151],["like",295,299],["engrossing",340,350],["charm",529,534],["strong",611,617],["good",711,715],["interesting",1068,1079],["improved",1095,1103],["pretty",1945,1951],["dignified",2066,2075],["wonderful",2511,2520]],"neg_words":[["object",152,158],["gloomy",259,265],["perversely",425,435],["gloomy",436,442],["cloud",470,475],["miss",1267,1271],["spoiled",2053,2060],["lie",2214,2217],["conspicuous",2562,2573],["steep",2837,2842],["lies",2910,2914]],"events":[],"dates":[["the twenty - four years",960,983]],"times":[],"distances":[["five miles",1420,1430]],"loc_advs":[["there",238,243],["there",452,457],["there",878,883],["there",2225,2230],["here",2252,2256],["behind",2364,2370],["left",2609,2613],["below",2688,2693]],"spa_preps":[["within",71,77],["out",592,595],["through",1155,1162],["through",1395,1402],["into",1445,1449],["between",1582,1589],["together",2231,2239],["out",2415,2418],["opposite",2705,2713],["into",2865,2869]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0039370079,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9940331578},{"para_id":91,"paragraph":"There is no beauty in the primitive little town itself; but it has its attractions, besides the convenience of its central situation among so many mountains and valleys.

The Ratcliffes also possessed Lord's Island, the largest on the lake, where their mansion is said to have been built, from the stones of the old one on Castlehead. Ramps Holme, another of the islands, was their's also; and the hermit, the dear friend of St. Cuthbert, who lived in St. Herbert's Isle in the seventh century, is somehow mixed up in legends, in local imaginations which are careless of dates, with the same family. All that is known of St. Herbert is, that he really had a hermitage in that island, and that St. Cuthbert and he used to meet, either at Lindisfarn or Derwentwater, once a-year. The legend about their deaths is well known; that, according to their prayer, they died on the same day. There is beauty in the tradition that the man of action and the man of meditation, the propagandist and the recluse, were so dear to each other, and so congenial. Vicar's, or Derwent Isle, is the other of the four larger islands. Lord's Isle was once a part of the mainland. The Ratcliffes cut a fosse, in the feudal times, and set up a drawbridge. When the young Lord Derwentwater was captured for being\" out\" in 1715, his lady escaped, and saved her liberty and the family jewels( to use them on behalf of her husband) by clambering up one of the clefts of Wallabarrow Crag, since called the Lady's Rake.

Sometimes it comes up a mere patch, and sometimes measuring as much as an acre.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Pike",348,352],["Floating Island",438,453]],"geonouns":[["lake",4,8],["waters",97,103],["shores",205,211],["crag",275,279],["peak",284,288],["mountain",296,304],["lake",385,389],["water",427,432],["mere",892,896]],"pos_words":[["clear",119,124],["marvellous",217,227],["beauty",228,234],["abound",371,377],["magic",794,799],["excited",811,818],["sensation",827,836]],"neg_words":[["decayed",603,610]],"events":[],"dates":[["a few years",519,530]],"times":[],"distances":[["about three miles",12,29],["about a mile and a half",63,86]],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0740740741,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988005161},{"para_id":97,"paragraph":"First Tour.

The circuit is one of 13 miles; and it must be accomplished on foot or horseback; for there is no carriage-road in the upper part. So few pass that way that the women afford a remarkable specimen of the effects of a life of excessive seclusion. The men go to markets and sales, and have more use of their tongues and wits accordingly. The road along the lake side is followed, till it gives out a branch before reaching Barrow House. Up this by-road the explorer goes, and passes behind and above Barrow House, soon reaching the stream that feeds the Barrow fall, which may be visited by strangers in the grounds below. The upland valley runs parallel with the lower one; and in it lies the clear circular pool which feeds the fall of Lodore. Stout pedestrians say that the walk over the trackless heather, turning to the left, over the fells to Thirlmere, is glorious in a fine autumn day. No doubt it is: but our business now is to follow the track before us. It takes us to the little foot-bridge between the tarn and the verge of the crag; and the peep down the chasm shows the lake and the Skiddaw range in beautiful union. Helvellyn rises to the east, and Scawfell and Bowfell show themselves in front, all the way down into Borrowdale. The descent upon Rosthwaite is the concluding treat. The way is easy,-- a gentle slope over grass and elastic heather; and the whole surface is starred over with bright heath flowers. The head of the dale, imposing under all aspects, opens out, and seems to be spreading its green levels for the stranger's rest. The passes to Langdale by the Stake, to Wastdale by Sty Head, and to Buttermere by Honister Crag, disclose themselves round the projecting Glaramara. The other way lie Grange and the Lake; and beneath lies Rosthwaite, with the brattling stream behind, which must be crossed by stepping-stones to reach the little inn. Before turning his face lakewards, the traveller must go forward a few yards from Simpson's inn, to where he will see a narrow entrance and steps in the right-hand fence. He must go in there, and mount that little hill, called Castlehill, whence the truest and best total view of Borrowdale is obtained; for the station is nearly central.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Watendlath",239,249],["Borrowdale",294,304],["Rosthwaite",308,318],["Barrow House",740,752],["Barrow House",817,829],["Barrow",871,877],["Lodore",1055,1061],["Thirlmere",1166,1175],["Skiddaw",1415,1422],["Helvellyn",1449,1458],["Scawfell",1482,1490],["Bowfell",1495,1502],["Borrowdale",1551,1561],["Rosthwaite",1580,1590],["Langdale",1890,1898],["Stake",1906,1911],["Wastdale",1916,1924],["Sty Head",1928,1936],["Buttermere",1945,1955],["Honister Crag",1959,1972],["Glaramara",2015,2024],["Grange",2044,2050],["Rosthwaite",2082,2092],["Castlehill",2421,2431],["Borrowdale",2474,2484]],"geonouns":[["valleys",88,95],["mountains",151,160],["foot",383,387],["carriage",418,426],["road",427,431],["pass",458,462],["markets",579,586],["road",659,663],["lake",674,678],["road",765,769],["passes",793,799],["stream",849,855],["fall",878,882],["grounds",925,932],["valley",951,957],["track",1265,1270],["foot",1308,1312],["bridge",1313,1319],["tarn",1332,1336],["crag",1358,1362],["lake",1402,1406],["slope",1644,1649],["head",1751,1755],["dale",1763,1767],["passes",1880,1886],["stream",2113,2119],["stones",2162,2168],["inn",2189,2192],["inn",2286,2289],["entrance",2321,2329],["mount",2390,2395],["hill",2408,2412],["station",2506,2513]],"pos_words":[["accomplished",367,379],["afford",487,493],["remarkable",496,506],["glorious",1180,1188],["beautiful",1432,1441],["gentle",1637,1643],["bright",1725,1731],["right",2347,2352],["best",2455,2459]],"neg_words":[["primitive",78,87],["excessive",544,553],["lies",1002,1006],["doubt",1214,1219],["imposing",1769,1777],["stranger",1859,1867],["lie",2040,2043],["lies",2077,2081]],"events":[],"dates":[["the clear",1007,1016],["the fall of",1043,1054],["a fine",1192,1198],["autumn day",1199,1209]],"times":[],"distances":[["13 miles",342,350]],"loc_advs":[["there",406,411],["left",1142,1146],["beneath",2069,2076],["forward",2251,2258],["there",2379,2384]],"spa_preps":[["into",289,293],["along",664,669],["out",711,714],["behind",800,806],["above",811,816],["below",933,938],["over",1099,1103],["over",1148,1152],["between",1320,1327],["down",1377,1381],["down",1541,1545],["into",1546,1550],["over",1650,1654],["over",1715,1719],["under",1778,1783],["out",1803,1806],["round",1994,1999],["behind",2120,2126]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0042735043,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.912628293},{"para_id":100,"paragraph":"He is now standing in the middle of that far-famed Borrowdale, of which so many curious tales are told. Its inhabitants were once considered as primitive as we now consider those of Watendlath; and a good deal more, if the current stories are true. It is said that an old Borrowdale man was once sent a very long way for something very new, by some innovator who had found his way into the dale. The man was to go with horse and sacks( for there were no carts, because there was no road) to bring some lime from beyond Keswick. On his return, when he was near Grange, it began to rain; and the man was alarmed at seeing his sacks begin to smoke. He got a hatful of water from the river; but the smoke grew worse. Assured at length that the devil must be in any fire which was aggravated by water, he tossed the whole load over into the river. That must have been before the dalesmen built their curious wall; for they must have had lime for that. Spring being very charming in Borrowdale, and the sound of the cuckoo gladsome, the people determined to build a wall to keep in the cuckoo, and make the spring last for ever. So they built a wall across the entrance, at Grange. The plan did not answer; but that was, according to the popular belief from generation to generation, because the wall was not built one course higher. It is simply for want of a top course in that wall that eternal spring does not reign in Borrowdale. Another anecdote shows, however, that a bright wit did occasionally show himself among them. A\" statesman\"--( an\" estatesman,\" or small proprietor)-- went one day to a distant fair or sale, and brought home what neither he nor his neighbours had ever seen before;-- a pair of stirrups. Home he came jogging, with his feet in his stirrups; but, by the time he reached his own door, he had jammed his feet in so fast that they would not come out. There was great alarm and lamentation; but, as it could not be helped now, the good man patiently sat his horse in the pasture for a day or two, his family bringing him food, till the eldest son, vexed to see the horse suffering by exposure, proposed to bring both into the stable. This was done; and there sat the farmer for several days,-- his food being brought to him, as before. At length, it struck the second son that it was a pity not to make his father useful, and release the horse; so he proposed to carry him, on the saddle, into the house. By immense exertion it was done; the horse being taken alongside the midden in the yard, to ease the fall: and the good man found himself under his own roof again,-- spinning wool in a corner of the kitchen. There the mounted man sat spinning, through the cleverness of his second son, till the lucky hour arrived of his youngest son's return,-- he being a scholar,-- a learned student from St. Bees. After duly considering the case, he gave his counsel. He suggested that the goodman should draw his feet out of his shoes. This was done, amidst the blessings of the family; and the goodman was restored to his occupations and to liberty. The wife was so delighted that she said if she had a score of children, she would make them all scholars,-- if only she had to begin life again.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Borrowdale",51,61],["Watendlath",182,192],["Borrowdale",272,282],["Keswick",519,526],["Grange",560,566],["Borrowdale",977,987],["Grange",1168,1174],["Borrowdale",1417,1427],["St. Bees",2818,2826]],"geonouns":[["dale",390,394],["road",482,486],["water",665,670],["river",680,685],["water",790,795],["river",836,841],["wall",903,907],["wall",1060,1064],["wall",1139,1143],["entrance",1155,1163],["wall",1290,1294],["wall",1374,1378],["feet",1746,1750],["door",1804,1808],["feet",1828,1832],["house",2420,2425],["feet",2928,2932]],"pos_words":[["famed",45,50],["good",200,204],["charming",965,973],["popular",1232,1239],["top",1355,1358],["bright",1469,1475],["fair",1605,1609],["fast",1839,1843],["great",1884,1889],["helped",1937,1943],["good",1953,1957],["patiently",1962,1971],["stable",2148,2154],["useful",2336,2342],["immense",2430,2437],["ease",2519,2523],["good",2542,2546],["restored",3022,3030],["liberty",3057,3064],["delighted",3082,3091]],"neg_words":[["primitive",144,153],["alarmed",602,609],["smoke",639,644],["smoke",695,700],["worse",706,711],["devil",740,745],["alarm",1890,1895],["suffering",2093,2102],["struck",2272,2278],["pity",2308,2312]],"events":[],"dates":[["Spring",947,953],["the spring",1097,1107],["spring",1392,1398],["one day",1584,1591],["a day",2005,2010],["the fall",2524,2532]],"times":[["the lucky hour",2718,2732]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",440,445],["there",469,474],["home",1631,1635],["there",2175,2180]],"spa_preps":[["into",381,385],["beyond",512,518],["near",555,559],["over",822,826],["into",827,831],["across",1144,1150],["among",1510,1515],["out",1869,1872],["into",2139,2143],["into",2411,2415],["alongside",2482,2491],["under",2565,2570],["through",2671,2678],["out",2933,2936],["amidst",2966,2972]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0350877193,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9915708303},{"para_id":101,"paragraph":"It is by no means to be supposed, however, that there was no wit in the valley, but what had come from St. Bees. On the contrary, a native genius, on one occasion, came to a conclusion so striking that it is doubtful whether any university could rival it. A stranger came riding into the dale on a mule, and, being bound for the mountains, went up the pass on foot, leaving the animal in the care of his host. The host had never seen such a creature before, nor had his neighbours. Fearing mischief, they consulted the wise man of the dale; for they kept a Sagum, or medicine man, to supply their deficiencies. He came, and after an examination of the mule, drew a circle round it, and consulted his books while his charms were burning; and, at length, announced that he had found it. The creature must be, he concluded, a peacock. So Borrowdale could then boast, without a rival, of a visit from a stranger who came riding on a peacock. There is a real and strong feeling in the district about these old stories. Only last year, when a Borrowdale man entered a country inn, a prior guest said simply\" cuckoo,\" and was instantly knocked down; and a passionate fight ensued. This cannot last much longer,-- judging by the number of new houses,-- abodes of gentry,-- built or building in Borrowdale.

It is a delightful little inn, clean and well managed, and, by its situation, preferable to those at Keswick, except for the convenience of headquarters. To visit the fall, the way is through the gay little garden, and the orchard,( where the fish-preserves are terrible temptations to waste of time) and over a foot bridge, and up into the wood, where the path leads to the front of the mighty chasm. It is the chasm, with its mass of boulders and its magnificent flanking towers of rock, that makes the impressiveness of the Lodore fall, more than the water. No supply short of a full river or capacious lake could correct the disproportion between the channel and the flood. After the most copious rains, the spectacle is of a multitude of little falls, and nowhere of a sheet or bold shoot of water.

On a lustrous summer evening, when the lights are radiant, and the shadows sharp and deep, the scene is incomparable, whatever may be the state of the water.

There must be a guide,-- be the day ever so clear, and the path ever so plain. Once for all let us say, in all earnestness, and with the most deliberate decision, that no kind of tourist should ever cross the higher passes, or ascend the mountains, without a guide. Surely, lives enough have been lost, and there has been suffering and danger enough, short of a fatal issue, to teach this lesson. But the confident and joyous pedestrian is not the most teachable of human beings. In his heart he despises the caution of native residents, and in his sleeve he laughs at it. The mountain is right before him; the track is visible enough; he has a map and guide book, and boasts of his pocket-compass. With the track on his map, and track on the mountain, both before his eyes, how should he get wrong? So he throws on his knapsack, seizes his stick, and goes off whistling or singing,-- the host and hostess looking after him and consulting as he strides away. For some time he thinks he can defy all the misleading powers of heaven and earth. But, once out of reach of human help, he finds his case not quite so easy as he thought. Instead of one path, as marked on his map, he finds three; and perhaps the one he relies on may have disappeared under recent accidents, or have lapsed into swamp. He finds himself on the edge of a precipice, and does not know how far to go back. He finds the bog deepen, and thinks he can scarcely be in the right road. He finds a landslip, which compels him to make a wider circuit, and meantime it is growing dusk. Worst of all, a fog may come on at any moment; and there is an end of all security to one who does not know the little wayside-marks which guide the shepherd in such a case. Tales are current throughout the region of the deaths of natives, even in the summer months, through fog, wet, fatigue, or fall,-- the native having a better chance than a stranger, ten times over. And why should the risk be run? It cannot be to save the fee, in the case of a journey of pleasure. The guide is worth more than his pay for the information he has to give,-- to say nothing of the comfort of his carrying the knapsack,-- as many knapsacks as there are walkers. If solitude be desired, the meditative gentleman will soon find that anxiety about the way, and an internal conflict with apprehensiveness are sad spoilers of the pleasures of solitude. Better have a real substantial, comfortable, supporting shepherd by his side, giving his mind liberty for contemplation and enjoyment of the scene, than the spectres of the mountain perplexing him on all sides, and marring his ease. But enough. Travellers who know what mountain climbing is, among loose stones, shaking bog, and slippery rushes or grass, with the alternative of a hot sun or a strong wind, and perpetual liability to mist, will not dispute the benefit of having a guide: and novices ought to defer to their judgment. If we have seemed to dwell long on this point, it is because warning is grievously wanted. It will probably not be taken by those who need it most; but it ought to be offered.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",14,21]],"geonouns":[["top",108,111],["path",199,203],["passes",356,362],["mountains",378,387],["mountain",717,725],["track",751,756],["track",848,853],["track",870,875],["mountain",883,891],["path",1286,1290],["edge",1459,1463],["precipice",1469,1478],["bog",1531,1534],["road",1586,1590],["region",1896,1902],["mountain",2697,2705],["mountain",2794,2802],["stones",2828,2834],["bog",2844,2847],["point",3098,3103]],"pos_words":[["easy",25,29],["clear",184,189],["earnestness",251,262],["enough",420,426],["enough",483,489],["confident",545,554],["joyous",559,565],["right",729,734],["enough",768,774],["heaven",1164,1170],["easy",1251,1255],["right",1580,1585],["better",2014,2020],["pleasure",2151,2159],["worth",2174,2179],["comfort",2258,2265],["comfortable",2556,2567],["supporting",2569,2579],["liberty",2618,2625],["enjoyment",2648,2657],["ease",2751,2755],["enough",2761,2767],["hot",2905,2908],["strong",2918,2924],["benefit",2985,2992]],"neg_words":[["lost",437,441],["suffering",462,471],["danger",476,482],["fatal",502,507],["issue",508,513],["wrong",933,938],["defy",1130,1134],["misleading",1143,1153],["lapsed",1416,1422],["scarcely",1561,1569],["fatigue",1974,1981],["stranger",2035,2043],["risk",2080,2084],["anxiety",2407,2414],["conflict",2446,2454],["sad",2481,2484],["perplexing",2706,2716],["loose",2822,2827],["liability",2945,2954],["mist",2958,2962],["dispute",2973,2980],["warning",3119,3126],["grievously",3130,3140]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",168,175],["the summer months",1937,1954]],"times":[["dusk",1683,1687]],"distances":[["six miles",129,138]],"loc_advs":[["without",389,396],["there",447,452],["away",1093,1097],["there",1740,1745],["throughout",1881,1891],["there",2319,2324]],"spa_preps":[["out",1192,1195],["under",1384,1389],["into",1423,1427],["through",1956,1963],["over",2055,2059],["about",2415,2420],["among",2816,2821]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0072202166,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9804360867},{"para_id":121,"paragraph":"Even in the mild ascent of green Skiddaw, then, there is a guide. -- At the distance of half - a-mile from Keswick, on the Penrith road, just through the toll-bar, a bridge crosses the Greta.

On the eastern side, within the circle, there is a small recess formed by ten stones, making an oblong square. As Southey observed, the spot is the most commanding that could be chosen, short of a mountain side; and it is indeed nearly surrounded by mountains, which it recognises in their true forms, from the levels,-- with the exception of the plain towards Penrith,-- being sunk out of view. The old legend about the last human sacrifice of the Druids may belong to any of the monuments of that age in the district; and it is probably claimed for them all. According to that old story; when some people settled in a clearing of the woods, beside a river, somewhere to the south of the district, the priests took up their station further north, among the mountains, where there were plenty of stones fit and ready for their temple. After a time, a fever laid waste the lower settlement; and the oracle demanded a sacrifice to appease the divine wrath. The lot fell on a young girl who was betrothed: and, on an appointed day, she was conveyed, with all the ceremonies, to the temple. A small hut of wickerwork, like a large beehive, was found set up on the western side of the temple. The girl was led into the circle, and placed in the midst, while the dedication proceeded. We are even told that she was adorned with an oak garland, and held mistletoe in her hand. The whole population was looking on from a distance: but it must have been within reasonable reach, as every one was required to contribute a stick to the fire. The wretched lover saw all from afar; and he daringly resolved,-- let the god be as wrathful as he pleased,-- not to contribute so much as a twig to the burning of his beloved. She was seen to enter the door, which was next the circle; and then the priest closed it up, and heaped the dried leaves and sticks that were brought all round the hut. The arch-druid meantime was procuring fire from two pieces of wood. He succeeded, and set the pile in a blaze. In this moment of desperation, the lover saw every mountain round give forth a great cataract; and all the floods gushed to the temple as to a centre, and made an island of the little hut,-- returning when they had extinguished the fire. The victim came forth, with not a hair singed, and not a leaf of her garland withered. The arch-druid, skilled to interpret thunder, seems to have understood in this case the voice of waters; for he announced that, henceforth, the god would have no more human sacrifices. Any resident who is sufficiently familiar with the country people to get them to speak their minds fully, will find that they still hold to the notion that nobody can count the druid stones correctly; and also that a treasure is buried under the largest stone. As to the first,-- there are, in most such circles, some smaller stones cropping out of the ground which some visitors will, and others will not, include among those of the circle. We ourselves counted Long Meg and her daughters, near Penrith, many times before making out the prescribed sixty - seven, with any certainty. As for the treasure, can any one prove that it is not there? Nobody wants to undermine the stone, to get rid of the tradition: so our neighbours are like the Arabs at Petra, who have been shooting with sling, bow, and matchlock, for a thousand years, at the urn, where they are sure Pharaoh's treasure is,-- in its niche in the rock temple. For a thousand years, they have failed to bring it down, and are determined that no European shall. And no European would dismantle the temple to disabuse the Arabs; and so the tradition and the urn stand untouched. So may it be for ages to come with Long Meg, and the giant of eight tons' weight that presides over the Keswick circle!","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Saddleback",17,27],["Keswick",111,118],["St. John's Vale",207,222],["England",383,390],["Penrith,",3386,3394],["Keswick",4135,4142]],"geonouns":[["field",179,184],["entrance",195,203],["stones",228,234],["monuments",363,372],["stones",470,476],["mountain",589,597],["mountains",642,651],["monuments",873,882],["district",902,910],["woods",1028,1033],["river",1044,1049],["district",1081,1089],["station",1117,1124],["mountains",1150,1159],["stones",1188,1194],["door",2126,2130],["wood",2331,2335],["mountain",2431,2439],["cataract",2465,2473],["island",2543,2549],["waters",2802,2808],["country",2941,2948],["stones",3073,3079],["stone",3144,3149],["stones",3216,3222],["ground",3243,3249],["stone",3565,3570],["rock",3802,3806]],"pos_words":[["good",38,42],["well",130,134],["ready",1203,1208],["divine",1333,1339],["like",1506,1510],["led",1593,1596],["reasonable",1844,1854],["lover",1936,1941],["daringly",1968,1976],["beloved",2091,2098],["succeeded",2340,2349],["lover",2415,2420],["great",2459,2464],["skilled",2721,2728],["sufficiently",2910,2922],["correctly",3080,3089],["treasure",3107,3115],["treasure",3485,3493],["like",3623,3627],["treasure",3767,3775]],"neg_words":[["sunk",770,774],["fever",1243,1248],["waste",1254,1259],["wrath",1340,1345],["fell",1355,1359],["wretched",1927,1935],["burning",2076,2083],["desperation",2398,2409],["undermine",3551,3560],["failed",3847,3853],["untouched",4020,4029]],"events":[],"dates":[["forty",236,241],["an appointed day",1403,1419],["a thousand years",3707,3723],["a thousand years",3819,3835]],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile",88,94]],"loc_advs":[["near",186,190],["there",279,284],["within",413,419],["there",432,437],["beside",1035,1041],["somewhere",1051,1060],["there",1167,1172],["afar",1955,1959],["henceforth",2833,2843],["there",3170,3175],["near",3381,3385],["there",3528,3533]],"spa_preps":[["out",775,778],["about",803,808],["among",1140,1145],["into",1597,1601],["within",1837,1843],["round",2254,2259],["round",2440,2445],["under",3126,3131],["out",3232,3235],["among",3305,3310],["out",3420,3423],["down",3866,3870],["over",4126,4130]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0247252747,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987202883},{"para_id":124,"paragraph":"The ascent of Saddleback may begin behind Threlkeld, up a path which the villagers will point out: but an easier way is, to diverge from the main road some way further on, by the road to Hesket, near the village of Scales. The hill-side path is to be taken which leads along Souter Fell, by the side of the stream which descends from Scales tarn. This part is the very home of superstition and romance. This Souter, or Soutra Fell, is the mountain on which ghosts appeared in myriads, at intervals during ten years of the last century,-- presenting precisely the same appearances to twenty - six chosen witnesses, and to all the inhabitants of all the cottages within view of the mountain; and for a space of two hours and a-half at one time-- the spectral show being then closed by darkness. The mountain is full of precipices which defy all marching of bodies of men; and the north and west sides present a sheer perpendicular of 900 feet. On Midsummer eve, 1735, a farm-servant of Mr. Lancaster's, half - a-mile from the mountain, saw the eastern side of the summit covered with troops, which pursued their onward march for an hour. They came, in distinct bodies, from an eminence in the north end, and disappeared in a niche in the summit. When the poor fellow told this tale, he was insulted on all hands; as original observers usually are when they see anything wonderful. Two years after, also on a Midsummer eve, Mr. Lancaster saw some men there, apparently following their horses, as if they had returned from hunting. He thought nothing of this; but he happened to look up again ten minutes after, and saw the figures now mounted, and followed by an interminable array of troops, five abreast, marching from the eminence and over the cleft, as before. All the family saw this, and the manoeuvres of the force, as each company was kept in order by a mounted officer who galloped this way and that. As the shades of twilight came on, the discipline appeared to relax, and the troops intermingled, and rode at unequal paces, till all was lost in darkness. Now, of course, all the Lancasters were insulted, as their servant had been: but their justification was not long delayed. On the Midsummer eve of the fearful 1745, twenty - six persons, expressly summoned by the family, saw all that had been seen before, and more. Carriages were now interspersed with the troops; and every body knew that no carriages ever had been, or could be, on the summit of Souter Fell. The multitude was beyond imagination; for the troops filled a space of half - a-mile, and marched quickly till night hid them,-- still marching. There was nothing vaporous or indistinct about the appearance of these spectres. So real did they seem that some of the people went up, the next morning, to look for the hoof-marks of the horses; and awful it was to them to find not one foot-print on heather or grass. The witnesses attested the whole story on oath before a magistrate; and fearful were the expectations held by the whole country-side about the coming events of the Scotch rebellion. It now came out that two other persons had seen something of the sort in the interval, viz., in 1743,-- but had concealed it to escape the insults to which their neighbours were subjected. Mr. Wren, of Wilton Hall, and his farm-servant, saw, one summer evening, a man and a dog on the mountain, pursuing some horses along a place so steep that a horse could hardly, by any possibility, keep a footing on it. Their speed was prodigious, and their disappearance at the south end of the fell so rapid, that Mr. Wren and the servant went up, the next morning, to find the body of the man who must have been killed. Of man, horse, or dog, they found not a trace: and they came down, and held their tongues. When they did speak, they fared not much the better for having twenty - six sworn comrades in their disgrace. As for the explanation,-- the Editor of the Lonsdale Magazine declared( Vol. ii. p. 313.) that it was discovered that on that Midsummer eve of 1745, the rebels were\" exercising on the western coast of Scotland, whose movements had been reflected by some transparent vapour, similar to the Fata Morgana.\" This is not much in the way of explanation: but it is, as far as we know, all that can be had at present. The facts, however, brought out a good many more; as the spectral march of the same kind seen in Leicestershire in 1707: and the tradition of the tramp of armies over Helvellyn, on the eve of the battle of Marston Moor. And now the tourist may proceed,-- looking for ghosts, if he pleases, on Souter Fell.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Saddleback",14,24],["Threlkeld",42,51],["Hesket",187,193],["Lancaster",988,997],["Lancaster",1425,1434],["Scotland",4083,4091],["Leicestershire",4389,4403],["Helvellyn",4459,4468]],"geonouns":[["path",58,62],["point",88,93],["road",146,150],["road",179,183],["village",204,211],["hill",227,231],["path",237,241],["stream",307,313],["tarn",341,345],["mountain",439,447],["cottages",652,660],["mountain",680,688],["mountain",797,805],["precipices",817,827],["farm",968,972],["mountain",1024,1032],["summit",1062,1068],["summit",1236,1242],["force",1813,1818],["carriages",2406,2415],["summit",2451,2457],["country",3008,3015],["farm",3293,3297],["mountain",3355,3363],["coast",4074,4079]],"pos_words":[["easier",106,112],["leads",263,268],["precisely",549,558],["eminence",1175,1183],["wonderful",1368,1377],["eminence",1722,1730],["prodigious",3494,3504],["rapid",3562,3567],["better",3817,3823],["transparent",4136,4147],["good",4326,4330],["pleases",4573,4580]],"neg_words":[["superstition",377,389],["darkness",783,791],["defy",834,838],["poor",1253,1257],["insulted",1288,1296],["unequal",2017,2024],["lost",2045,2049],["darkness",2053,2061],["insulted",2103,2111],["delayed",2177,2184],["fearful",2214,2221],["awful",2819,2824],["fearful",2960,2967],["insults",3209,3216],["subjected",3248,3257],["steep",3403,3408],["fell",3554,3558],["killed",3673,3679],["disgrace",3872,3880],["tramp",4438,4443]],"events":[],"dates":[["ten years",505,514],["Midsummer eve, 1735",945,964],["march",1117,1122],["Two years",1379,1388],["1745",2222,2226],["one summer",3312,3322],["1745",4025,4029],["march",4358,4363],["1707",4407,4411]],"times":[["two hours",709,718],["an hour",1127,1134],["ten minutes",1589,1600],["night",2585,2590],["the next morning",2755,2771],["evening",3323,3330],["the next morning",3608,3624]],"distances":[["900 feet",932,940],["half - a-mile",1001,1014],["half - a-mile",2545,2558],["one foot",2852,2860]],"loc_advs":[["behind",35,41],["home",369,373],["there",1448,1453]],"spa_preps":[["out",94,97],["near",195,199],["along",269,274],["within",661,667],["over",1735,1739],["beyond",2492,2498],["about",2660,2665],["about",3021,3026],["out",3082,3085],["along",3386,3391],["down",3742,3746],["out",4320,4323],["over",4454,4458]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0198511166,"vader_sentiment":-0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980348945},{"para_id":125,"paragraph":"Here, too, lies another wonder,-- that tarn( Scales Tarn) which is said to reflect the stars at noonday,-- a marvel which we by no means undertake to avouch. The tarn is so situated at the foot of a vast precipice, and so buried among crags, that the sun never reaches it, except through a crevice in early morning. This dark water is one of the attractions which bring strangers to this mountain; though the easy ascent of Skiddaw better suits the greater number. Another attraction here is the deeper solitude of the recesses of old Blencathra,-- as Saddleback should still be called. Another is the view of Derwent Water from the summit. Southey says,\" Derwent Water, as seen from the top of Saddleback, is one of the fines mountain scenes in the country.\" That summit is called Linthwaite Fell; and there the guide will point out, better than we can do, the various objects,-- seas, islands, castles in their woods, and cities of the plain; mountains, far and near; shores, like the boundaries of an estate, and lakes like its fish-ponds. People who made the ascent sixty years since have left a terrifying account of its dangers, such as now excites a smile among energetic tourists. One gentleman was so\" astonished,\" near the outlet,\" with the different appearance of objects in the valley beneath,\" that he chose to stay behind. Another of the four presently\" wished to lose blood and return:\" but he was coaxed onwards to the tarn, where, however, he could see no stars, though it was noonday. Mr. Green, with his companion Mr. Otley, was among the earlier adventurers who stood on the highest ridge. He was so accurate an observer that his descriptions of unfrequented and unalterable places will never be antiquated. \" From Linthwaite Pike,\" he says,\" on soft green turf, we descended steeply, first southward, and then in an easterly direction to the Tarn; a beautiful circular piece of transparent water, with a well-defined shore. Here we found ourselves engulphed in a basin of steeps, having Tarn Crag on the north, the rocks falling from Sharp Edge on the east, and on the west, the soft turf on which we had made our downward progress. These side-grounds, in pleasant grassy banks, verge to the stream issuing from the lake, whence there is a charming opening to the town of Penrith; and Cross Fell seen in extreme distance. Wishing to vary our line in returning to the place we had left, we crossed the stream, and commenced a steep ascent at the foot of Sharp Edge. We had not gone far before we were aware that our journey would be attended with perils: the passage gradually grew narrower, and the declivity on each hand awfully precipitous. From walking erect, we were reduced to the necessity either of bestriding the ridge, or of moving on one of its sides, with our hands lying over the top, as a security against tumbling into the tarn on the left, or into a frightful gully on the right,-- both of immense depth. Sometimes we thought it prudent to return; but that seemed unmanly, and we proceeded; thinking with Shakspere that' dangers retreat when boldly theyere confronted.' Mr. Otley was the leader, who, on gaining steady footing, looked back on the writer, whom he perceived viewing at leisure from his saddle the remainder of his upward course.\" On better ground they had a retrospect on Sharp Edge,-- which is the narrowest ridge on Saddleback, or any other north-of-England mountain. In places, its top is composed of loose stones and earth; and, the stepping on the sides being as faithless as the top, the Sharp Edge expedition has less of safety in it than singularity.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Scales Tarn",45,56],["Skiddaw",424,431],["Saddleback",552,562],["Derwent Water",610,623],["Derwent Water",656,669],["Saddleback",695,705],["Otley",1537,1542],["Linthwaite Pike",1735,1750],["Crag",2013,2017],["Sharp Edge",2055,2065],["Penrith",2293,2300],["Cross Fell",2306,2316],["Sharp Edge",2474,2484],["Otley",3110,3115],["Saddleback",3369,3379],["England",3403,3410],["Sharp Edge",3545,3555]],"geonouns":[["tarn",39,43],["tarn",162,166],["foot",189,193],["precipice",204,213],["crags",235,240],["water",326,331],["mountain",388,396],["summit",633,639],["mountain",727,735],["country",750,757],["summit",765,771],["point",824,829],["seas",881,885],["islands",887,894],["castles",896,903],["woods",913,918],["mountains",945,954],["shores",970,976],["lakes",1016,1021],["outlet",1233,1239],["valley",1290,1296],["tarn",1435,1439],["ridge",1603,1608],["water",1911,1916],["shore",1938,1943],["rocks",2036,2041],["grounds",2165,2172],["banks",2193,2198],["stream",2213,2219],["lake",2237,2241],["town",2285,2289],["line",2363,2367],["stream",2422,2428],["foot",2466,2470],["ridge",2742,2747],["top",2813,2816],["tarn",2858,2862],["ground",3291,3297],["ridge",3360,3365],["mountain",3411,3419],["top",3436,3439],["stones",3461,3467]],"pos_words":[["marvel",109,115],["easy",409,413],["better",432,438],["attraction",473,483],["top",688,691],["better",835,841],["like",978,982],["like",1022,1026],["excites",1147,1154],["smile",1157,1162],["energetic",1169,1178],["astonished",1211,1221],["accurate",1620,1628],["soft",1766,1770],["beautiful",1871,1880],["transparent",1899,1910],["well",1925,1929],["soft",2100,2104],["progress",2144,2152],["pleasant",2177,2185],["charming",2261,2269],["immense",2926,2933],["prudent",2965,2972],["gaining",3140,3147],["steady",3148,3154],["better",3284,3290],["top",3536,3539]],"neg_words":[["lies",11,15],["dark",321,325],["lose",1378,1382],["antiquated",1716,1726],["steeply",1796,1803],["falling",2042,2049],["steep",2446,2451],["narrower",2602,2610],["awfully",2643,2650],["precipitous",2651,2662],["lying",2798,2803],["frightful",2886,2895],["retreat",3065,3072],["loose",3455,3460],["faithless",3519,3528]],"events":[],"dates":[["sixty years",1070,1081]],"times":[["early morning",301,314]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",484,488],["there",803,808],["left",1093,1097],["beneath",1297,1304],["southward",1811,1820],["there",2250,2255],["left",2401,2405],["left",2870,2874],["upward",3265,3271]],"spa_preps":[["among",229,234],["through",280,287],["out",830,833],["near",964,968],["among",1163,1168],["near",1224,1228],["behind",1329,1335],["among",1548,1553],["over",2804,2808],["against",2832,2839],["into",2849,2853],["into",2879,2883]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0352941176,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983591437},{"para_id":126,"paragraph":"And now,-- those who, after this, like to go there, know what they have to expect.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["like",34,38]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",45,50]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.2,"vader_sentiment":0.44,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9985402822},{"para_id":127,"paragraph":"The other mountain-lake, lying north-east of this, and called Bowscale Tarn, is also reputed to reflect the stars at noonday, but under so many conditions, that it will be a wonder if any body ever has the luck to see them.

This little lake is a mile and a-half from the main road, and the ascent is rather steep. It is the delight of the angler, because it is also the delight of the trout. It is overhung by High Street; so that perhaps the Roman eagles, as well as the native birds of the rocks, have cast their shadows upon its surface. Not far off lies Angle Tarn, on the southern end of Place Fell. Both these tarns send their brooks down, to swell the stream from Brothers' Water, which is itself supplied from the busy, noisy beck that descends the Kirkstone Pass; and the whole, united with a tributary from Deepdale, form the clear brown stream which winds through Patterdale, and empties itself into Ullswater. Brothers' Water derives its name from the accident-- which is said to have happened twice,-- of brothers being lost in it, in the attempt of one to save the other. On one of the two occasions, the accident happened through the breaking of the ice, when the brothers were making a venturesome short cut across it to church. -- No persuasion of ours can be necessary to induce any traveller to visit Deepdale, if he has time.

The series of sonnets that Wordsworth has given us may have led strangers to expect too much: but to an unprepossessed eye the valley must appear lovely. Leaving the Bootle road and the bridge to the left, the road ascends so steeply that the travellers will get out and walk; and many a time will they turn to the sea-view, and the wooded slopes on the way to Bootle, and the rocks, dressed with wild flowers, that enclose the road. Then comes a common covered with fern, in which the greenest of paths form a net-work: and far below dashes the brown river, between rocky banks; and Duddon Grove, with its conservatories and beautiful grounds and green clearings, is seen in the hollow of the vale. Four miles from Broughton, the bridge at Ulpha Kirk spans the river, and discloses a beautiful view, up and down, One thing which the traveller is always expected to remark is the strange holes( called pots) worn by the waters in the rocks, and the rounding of the edges of the boulders and shelves in the channel. Ulpha Kirk is a mere hamlet; but there is a little inn at which the horses can rest if the party are disposed for a walk to the scene of Robert Walker's life and labours. Ulpha Kirk itself is one of the primitive places where the old manners of the district may yet be traced more clearly than in most road-side settlements. The people still think it no sin to do their farm work on Sundays, when the weather,-- so precarious here,-- is favourable; and the familiar style of\" the priest\" in these parts makes the transition from work to worship very natural. Some time since there was a blind\" priest\" settled there. One Sunday morning, the bell rang before the people were all ready; and especially the stoutest farmer in the neighbourhood, who, detained by some cow, pig, or sheep, entered the church last of all,\" thunnering down the aisle.\" \" Wha's coming now?\" asked the blind priest; and, being informed by the clerk that it was John T--, he inquired further,\" a-foot or a-horseback?\" Odd sprinklings of learning are found in these by-places, as in Scotland. Some students staying at this same little inn, and wanting to settle their account, wrote a note in Latin to the landlord, asking for the bill, and sent it by the girl who waited. Mr. Gunson, the landlord,( from whom the present landlord is descended) immediately sent in the bill in Greek. It was too much for the students, who where obliged to ask to have it in English.

The grey farmsteads stand under their sycamores, dispersed in the vale, and up the slope which meets the Walna Scar track from Coniston. Rocky and wooded knolls diversify the dale; and the full beck runs down to join the Duddon, for which it is often mistaken: but the Duddon is unseen here, so deep lies its channel among the rocks. The church is little loftier or larger than the houses near. But for the bell, the traveller would hardly have noticed it for a church on approaching: but when he has reached it, there is the porch, and the little graveyard, with a few tombs, and the spreading yew, encircled by the seat of stones and turf, where the early comers sit and rest till the bell calls them in. A little dial, on a whitened post in the middle of the enclosure, tells the time to the neighbours who have no clocks. Just outside the wall is a white cottage, so humble that the stranger thinks it cannot be the parsonage: yet the climbing roses and glittering evergreens, and clear lattices, and pure uncracked walls, look as if it might be. He walks slowly past the porch, and sees some one who tells him that it is indeed Robert Walker's dwelling, and courteously invites him in to see the scene of those life-long charities. Here it was that the distant parishioners were fed on Sundays with broth, for which the whole week's supply of meat was freely bestowed. Hither it was that in winter he sent the benumbed children, in companies, from the school in the church, to warm themselves at the single household fire, while he sat by the altar all the school hours, keeping warmth in him by the exercise of the spinning wheel. But the story is too well known, as it stands in Wordsworth's works, to need further celebration here: too well known, we should think, not to induce tourists to walk two miles from Ulpha Kirk and back again, to visit the homes, in life and in death, of Robert Walker. There are changes even here. There is a school-house, warmer in winter than the church: and there is a decline in the number of attendants at church. The Wesleyan chapel at Ulpha has drawn away some; and the taste for Sunday diversion, which has found its way over the hills from Coniston, estranges more; and the descendant and successor of the good pastor says that\" the old stocks are gone, and the new families are different.\" Thus is the large world's experience reflected in this little vale!","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Newfield",0,8],["Seathwaite",20,30],["Walna Scar",233,243],["Coniston",255,263],["Duddon",349,355],["Duddon",397,403],["Wordsworth",1814,1824],["Ulpha Kirk",1947,1957],["Ulpha",2207,2212],["Coniston",2314,2322]],"geonouns":[["vale",194,198],["slope",211,216],["track",244,249],["dale",303,307],["beck",322,326],["channel",437,444],["rocks",455,460],["church",466,472],["houses",510,516],["church",590,596],["seat",745,749],["stones",753,759],["post",864,868],["wall",971,975],["cottage",987,994],["walls",1148,1153],["school",1585,1591],["church",1599,1605],["school",2074,2080],["house",2081,2086],["church",2114,2120],["church",2176,2182],["chapel",2197,2203],["hills",2303,2308],["vale",2527,2531]],"pos_words":[["humble",999,1005],["clear",1113,1118],["pure",1133,1137],["warm",1610,1614],["warmth",1712,1718],["well",1786,1790],["works",1827,1832],["celebration",1850,1861],["well",1872,1876],["warmer",2088,2094],["good",2380,2384]],"neg_words":[["mistaken",379,387],["lies",428,432],["stranger",1015,1023],["slowly",1188,1194],["death",2009,2014],["decline",2137,2144]],"events":[],"dates":[["sixty years",115,126],["the middle of the",872,889],["Sundays",1419,1426],["the whole week's",1449,1465],["winter",1524,1530],["winter",2098,2104],["Sunday",2252,2258]],"times":[["school hours",1690,1702]],"distances":[["two miles",1932,1941]],"loc_advs":[["here",414,418],["there",641,646],["outside",959,966],["past",1195,1199],["here",1862,1866],["here",2057,2061],["there",2126,2131],["away",2223,2227]],"spa_preps":[["under",154,159],["down",332,336],["among",445,450],["near",517,521],["over",2294,2298]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0220264317,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9964053631},{"para_id":143,"paragraph":"The finest part of the Duddon scenery is just here; and it is a charming walk by the stepping-stones, celebrated by Wordsworth, and up and over the moor, to descend upon Eskdale.

Fellfoot was the house of entertainment whence the pack-horse cavalcade began the ascent, or where they stopped to congratulate themselves on having accomplished the descent. The ascent of Wrynose from this point is long and rather steep: but the views behind become grander with every step. The travellers are now in Westmorland; but at the three shire stones at the top, where three counties meet, they will step into Lancashire, in order to leave it for Cumberland at Cockley Beck bridge, within three miles further on. We are glad to hear that a spirited citizen of Ambleside, to whom his neighbours are under great obligations, is erecting a stone pillar at the spot where the shire stones are, that the junction of counties may not be overlooked( as it easily may be now) by the unobservant traveller.

The stream which is now on the right, divides Lancashire from Cumberland; and Westmorland is left behind.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Skelwith",42,50],["Clappersgate",78,90],["Brathay",100,107],["Skelwith Bridge",179,194],["Colwith Bridge",487,501],["Colwith Force",503,516],["Langdale",695,703],["Wetherlam",731,740],["Blea Tarn",890,899],["Langdale",904,912],["Fellfoot",982,990],["Kendal",1014,1020],["Whitehaven",1024,1034],["Fellfoot",1117,1125],["Wrynose",1306,1313],["Westmorland",1435,1446],["Lancashire",1537,1547],["Cumberland",1574,1584],["Cockley Beck",1588,1600],["Ambleside",1687,1696],["Lancashire",2166,2176],["Cumberland",2182,2192],["Westmorland",2198,2209]],"geonouns":[["road",70,74],["valley",108,114],["road",165,169],["foot",219,223],["gap",240,243],["wall",251,255],["path",291,295],["wood",303,307],["road",342,346],["top",354,357],["hill",365,369],["road",422,426],["hill",479,483],["winding",673,680],["road",681,685],["lane",689,693],["gate",817,821],["road",837,841],["road",1004,1008],["region",1109,1115],["house",1134,1139],["point",1324,1329],["stones",1471,1477],["top",1485,1488],["bridge",1601,1607],["stone",1764,1769],["stones",1805,1811],["junction",1826,1834],["feet",2049,2053],["stones",2074,2080],["stream",2124,2130]],"pos_words":[["right",154,159],["better",205,211],["lead",319,323],["right",434,439],["sharp",453,458],["beautiful",635,644],["leading",876,883],["leading",971,978],["congratulate",1232,1244],["accomplished",1266,1278],["glad",1647,1651],["spirited",1667,1675],["great",1731,1736],["enjoy",1976,1981],["privilege",1986,1995],["right",2151,2156]],"neg_words":[["steep",473,478],["tumbles",575,582],["swelling",741,749],["steep",1349,1354]],"events":[],"dates":[["47",272,274]],"times":[["a height of",588,599]],"distances":[["about a mile",377,389],["seventy feet",600,612],["One mile",646,654],["About a mile",781,793],["three miles",1616,1627]],"loc_advs":[["there",806,811],["forward",864,871],["left",922,926],["left",2213,2217]],"spa_preps":[["through",228,235],["out",329,332],["into",333,337],["down",459,463],["along",663,668],["into",715,719],["into",1100,1104],["behind",1370,1376],["into",1532,1536],["within",1609,1615],["under",1725,1730],["behind",2218,2224]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0618556701,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9513284564},{"para_id":150,"paragraph":"We know nothing wilder in the district than the next two miles. These are the desolate hills in which the Duddon and the Esk take their rise; and Cockley Beck is the spot where the Duddon must be left, to cross over to the Esk. There is a farmhouse near the bridge, where horses can be refreshed, when a car comes this way, while travellers sit down by the stream to dinner. A melancholy and harassed traveller once came this way, whose adventure is still talked over in Eskdale and Borrowdale. A party of tourists, among whom were two sisters, were on the heights, intending to cross Esk Hause into Borrowdale, and to spend the night at Seathwaite,-- the first settlement there. Now there is, as we have seen, another Seathwaite on the Duddon; and mistakes frequently arise between them. On Esk Hause, one of the ladies lost sight of her party behind some of the rocks scattered among the tarns there, and took a turn to the right instead of the left. A shepherd of whom she inquired her way to Seathwaite, pointed down to the Duddon valley; and that way she went till she found herself at Cockley Beck, when the old shepherd farmer who lived there was getting his supper in the dusk of the autumn evening. He used his best courtesy to induce her to stay till daylight: but she was bent on going at once,-- so great would be her sister's terror. As she would not be persuaded, the old man went with her, putting his crust into his pocket. It was dark, and the lady was weary; and she was not aware what she was undertaking. After a long struggle, she fainted. The old man was afraid to leave her, lest he should not find her again: but he succeeded in reaching the water without losing sight of her white dress. He dipped his crust, and brought water in his hat to bathe her face. She revived, ate the crust, and strove onwards,-- persevering on her weary way till between one and two in the morning, when she met her sister and a party coming from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, with a dozen lanterns, to search for her. She gave her guide\" a one - pound note;\"( it was so long ago as that) and afterwards, sent him two more. The whole family connexion of that lady will remember for ever that there is a Seathwaite on each side Esk Hause.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Duddon",106,112],["Cockley Beck",146,158],["Duddon",181,187],["Eskdale",471,478],["Borrowdale",483,493],["Hause",589,594],["Borrowdale",600,610],["Seathwaite",719,729],["Duddon",737,743],["Hause",796,801],["Seathwaite",996,1006],["Duddon",1028,1034],["Cockley Beck",1091,1103],["Seathwaite",1950,1960],["Borrowdale",1964,1974],["Seathwaite",2202,2212],["Hause",2230,2235]],"geonouns":[["district",30,38],["hills",87,92],["bridge",258,264],["stream",357,363],["rocks",864,869],["valley",1035,1041],["water",1666,1671],["water",1746,1751]],"pos_words":[["refreshed",286,295],["right",926,931],["best",1220,1224],["great",1311,1316],["succeeded",1640,1649]],"neg_words":[["desolate",78,86],["melancholy",377,387],["harassed",392,400],["mistakes",749,757],["lost",821,825],["bent",1283,1287],["terror",1339,1345],["dark",1447,1451],["weary",1470,1475],["struggle",1538,1546],["afraid",1577,1583],["losing",1680,1686],["weary",1851,1856]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the night",625,634],["dusk",1180,1184],["autumn evening",1192,1206],["two in the morning",1882,1900]],"distances":[["the next two miles",44,62]],"loc_advs":[["left",196,200],["there",673,678],["there",684,689],["there",896,901],["left",947,951],["there",1144,1149],["without",1672,1679],["between",1866,1873],["there",2191,2196]],"spa_preps":[["over",211,215],["near",249,253],["down",345,349],["over",463,467],["among",516,521],["into",595,599],["between",775,782],["behind",845,851],["among",880,885],["down",1016,1020],["into",1423,1427]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.039408867,"vader_sentiment":0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.9978631139},{"para_id":151,"paragraph":"From Cockley Beck, the road climbs the side of Hardknot, and from the highest point commands a view of the sea.

The road winds pleasantly round bays and over promontories, and the pyramidal Yewbarrow, Great Gable, which closes in the dale, and Lingmell and the Scawfell Pikes to the right, all explain themselves. Several brooks and rills are passed, flowing down from the valleys; and the stranger exclaims that he should like to spend a whole summer here, to explore all the ways among the mountains. Several gentlemen have spent weeks together at Ritson's farm-house, at the dale head, where there are clean beds, and farm-house fare in plenty and perfection. The opening out of the dale head, when the valley has appeared to close in round the lake, is as wonderful a spectacle to strangers as any thing they see. The dale is one of those perfect levels, shut in by lake and mountains, which give a different impression from any other kind of scenery in the world. The passes themselves are so high as to leave no appearance of outlet, except by the lake; and of these passes there are but two,-- the Sty Head and Mosedale paths. The green and perfect level, to which the mountains come down with a sheer sweep, is partly divided off into fields; and a few farmhouses are set down among the fields, on the bends of the gushing and gurgling stream. There is a chapel,-- the humblest of chapels,-- with eight pews, and three windows in three sides, and a skylight over the pulpit. There is now a school:-- a chapel and a school and no public house! The schoolmaster is entertained on\" whittlegate\" terms: that is, he boards at the farm-houses in turn. An old man told us that the plan answers. \" He gets them on very well,\" said he;\" and particularly in the spelling. He thinks that if they can spell, they can do all the rest.\" Such are the original conclusions arrived at in Wastdale Head. It struck us that the children were dirtier than even in other vales, though the houses are so clean that you might eat your dinner off the board or the floor. But the state of children's skin and hair is owing to superstition, in all these dales; and the schoolmaster is the one who should cure the evil. A young lady who kindly undertook to wash and dress the infant of a sick woman, but who was not experienced in the process, exclaimed at the end\" Oh dear! I forgot it's hands and arms. I must wash them.\" The mother expressed great horror, and said that\" if the child's arms were washed before it was six months old, it would be a thief;\" and, added she, pathetically,\" I would not like that.\" The hair and nails must not be cut for a much longer time, for fear of a like result. The Yorkshire people put the alternative of dirty and clean rather strongly in their proverb,\" Better hev a bairn wi a mucky feace than wash its noase off:\" but the Cumberland folk view the matter more in a moral way, and refuse to have their children baptised into thievery.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Strands",23,30],["Yewbarrow",168,177],["Great Gable",179,190],["Scawfell",239,247],["Pikes",248,253],["Sty Head",1083,1091],["Mosedale",1096,1104],["Wastdale Head",1857,1870],["Yorkshire",2661,2670],["Cumberland",2822,2832]],"geonouns":[["mountains",58,67],["road",94,98],["bays",122,126],["promontories",136,148],["dale",212,216],["brooks",300,306],["valleys",351,358],["mountains",470,479],["farm",537,541],["house",542,547],["dale",556,560],["head",561,565],["beds",589,593],["farm",599,603],["house",604,609],["dale",664,668],["head",669,673],["valley",684,690],["lake",726,730],["dale",800,804],["lake",848,852],["mountains",857,866],["passes",951,957],["outlet",1010,1016],["lake",1032,1036],["passes",1051,1057],["paths",1105,1110],["mountains",1154,1163],["fields",1221,1227],["fields",1273,1279],["stream",1322,1328],["chapel",1488,1494],["school",1501,1507],["house",1522,1527],["farm",1611,1615],["houses",1616,1622],["vales",1935,1940],["houses",1953,1959],["dales",2113,2118]],"pos_words":[["pleasantly",105,115],["right",261,266],["like",401,405],["clean",583,588],["perfection",629,639],["wonderful",738,747],["perfect",821,828],["perfect",1126,1133],["well",1697,1701],["clean",1967,1972],["cure",2163,2167],["kindly",2195,2201],["great",2403,2408],["like",2559,2563],["like",2644,2648],["clean",2711,2716]],"neg_words":[["stranger",368,376],["struck",1875,1881],["superstition",2086,2098],["evil",2172,2176],["sick",2246,2250],["pathetically",2532,2544],["fear",2634,2638],["dirty",2701,2706],["refuse",2879,2885]],"events":[],"dates":[["78",36,38],["summer",423,429],["weeks",510,515],["six months old",2478,2492]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",430,434],["there",573,578],["there",1058,1063]],"spa_preps":[["round",116,121],["over",131,135],["down",337,341],["among",460,465],["together",516,524],["out",653,656],["close",707,712],["round",716,721],["down",1169,1173],["into",1216,1220],["down",1258,1262],["among",1263,1268],["over",1444,1448],["into",2918,2922]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0253623188,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.99864012},{"para_id":156,"paragraph":"Kirkfell, which stands backward, between Yewbarrow and Great Gable, was very tempting to a tourist who explored this neighbourhood some years ago; and he set out to get to Buttermere by Blacksail and Scarf Gap.

It is a mile to the Abbey, through the churchyard, and along the bank of the Calder, where again the most beautiful tricks of light are seen, with brown water and its white foam, red precipitous banks, and the greenest vegetation, with a wood crowning all. The scene is thoroughly monastic. There is no sound at noonday besides the gushing water, but the woodman's axe and the shock of a falling tree, or the whirr of the magpie, or the pipe of the thrush: but at night the rooks on their return to roost fill the air with their din. The ruins are presently seen, springing sheer from the greenest turf. Relics from the abbey are now placed beside the way; and the modern house appears at hand. The ruins should be approached from the front, so that the lofty pointed arches may best disclose the long perspective behind of grassy lawn and sombre woods. The Abbey is built of red sandstone of the neighbourhood, now sobered down by time( it was founded in A.D. 1134.) into the richest and softest tint that the eye could desire. But little is known of it beyond its date and the name of its founder, Ranulph, son of the first Ranulph de Meschines, a Norman noble. The church was small, as the scanty remains show; and the monastery, which now looks like a continuation of the same building, could not have contained a numerous company. From the fragments of effigies preserved, it appears that some eminent persons were buried here; but who these knights and nobles were, there is no record that can tell,-- carefully as these memorials were wrought to secure the immortality of this world. The eye is first fixed by the remains of the tower, from whose roofless summit dangles the tufted ivy, and whose base is embossed by the small lilac blossoms of the antirrhirom; but at last the great charm is found in the aisle of clustered pillars. Almost the whole aisle is standing, still connected by the cornice and wall which supported the roof. The honeysuckle and ivy climb till they fall over on the other side. There is a sombre corner where the great ash grows over towards the tower, making a sort of tent in the recess. There are niches and damp cells in the conventual range. It is a small ruin, but thoroughly beautiful: and when the stranger looks and listens, as he stands in the green level between woods, he will feel how well the old monks knew how to choose their dwelling-places, and what it must have been to the earnest and pious among these Cistercians to pace their river bank, and to attune their thoughts to the unceasing music of the Calder flowing by. In the broad noon it is a fine thing to see the shadows flung, short and sharp, on the sward, and to catch the burnish of the ivy, and woo the shade of the avenue: and in the evening, it is charming to see how the last glow in the west brings out the projections and recesses of the ruins, and how the golden moon hangs over the eastern mass of tree tops, ready to take her turn in disclosing the beauties of the monastic retreat.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Abbey",128,133],["Abbey",360,365],["The Abbey",1194,1203]],"geonouns":[["carriage",35,43],["gate",100,104],["inn",163,166],["bridge",181,187],["waters",223,229],["bridge",255,261],["banks",276,281],["bank",405,409],["water",493,498],["banks",535,540],["wood",578,582],["water",680,685],["tree",736,740],["abbey",960,965],["house",1012,1017],["lawn",1171,1175],["woods",1187,1192],["church",1508,1514],["building",1621,1629],["tower",1976,1981],["summit",2003,2009],["wall",2252,2256],["tower",2420,2425],["woods",2648,2653],["river",2823,2828],["bank",2829,2833],["tree",3258,3262]],"pos_words":[["beautifully",201,212],["beautiful",446,455],["modern",1005,1011],["best",1119,1123],["noble",1497,1502],["like",1589,1593],["eminent",1739,1746],["secure",1893,1899],["great",2125,2130],["charm",2131,2136],["supported",2263,2272],["great",2387,2392],["beautiful",2556,2565],["well",2672,2676],["earnest",2767,2774],["attune",2842,2848],["sharp",2986,2991],["woo",3048,3051],["charming",3103,3111],["glow",3132,3136],["golden",3215,3221],["tops",3263,3267],["ready",3269,3274]],"neg_words":[["incessantly",306,317],["precipitous",523,534],["shock",717,722],["falling",728,735],["din",869,872],["ruins",878,883],["ruins",1039,1044],["wrought",1882,1889],["fall",2323,2327],["ruin",2535,2539],["stranger",2580,2588],["ruins",3196,3201],["hangs",3227,3232],["retreat",3335,3342]],"events":[],"dates":[["1134",1301,1305],["a fine",2937,2943]],"times":[["an hour",73,80],["night",804,809],["noon",2926,2930],["the evening",3084,3095]],"distances":[["a mile",346,352]],"loc_advs":[["beside",981,987],["behind",1154,1160],["beyond",1395,1401],["here",1767,1771],["there",1812,1817]],"spa_preps":[["within",66,72],["into",154,158],["away",236,240],["under",241,246],["through",367,374],["along",395,400],["down",1264,1268],["into",1308,1312],["over",2328,2332],["over",2403,2407],["between",2640,2647],["among",2785,2790],["out",3156,3159],["over",3233,3237]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0299003322,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986259937},{"para_id":160,"paragraph":"The Abbey is carefully preserved, and liberally laid open to strangers by Capt.

The sea-view is fine,-- all flecked with cloud shadows as with islands: and the wide down sprinkled with sheep, that look as ragged as terriers, after tearing their fleeces with the furze and brambles with which the swelling slopes are embossed. In a hollow, at rare intervals, stands a farm-house, under the ordinary sycamore canopy; and far away, between the slopes of the down below, the soil is cut up into fields, with woods hanging above; and at the mouth of the vale, between it and the coast, stands Egremont, a little town of 1,500 inhabitants or so, and which certainly looks very pretty from the uplands;-- and cheerful too, in spite of its Roman name,--( the Mount of Sorrow.) It is distinguished by Roman traditions. It was at the gateway of Egremont Castle that the horn was hung, in crusading days, which was twice blown by the gallant Sir Eustace de Lacy. As the Cumberlanders tell, Sir Eustace and his brother Hubert rode forth together to the Holy Wars; and Sir Eustace blew the horn, saying to his brother,\" If I fall in Palestine, do thou return and blow this horn, and take possession; that Egremont may not be without a Lacy for its Lord.\" In Palestine, ambition of this lordship so took possession of Hubert, that he hired ruffians to drown his brother in the Jordan: and the ruffians assured him that the deed was done. He returned home, and stole into the castle by night,-- not daring to sound the horn. But he soon plucked up spirit, and drowned his remorse in revels. In the midst of a banquet, one day, the horn was heard, sounding such a blast that the echoes came back from the fells, after startling the red deer from his covert, and the wild boar from his drinking at the tarn. Hubert knew that none but Eustace could or would so sound the horn: and he fled by a postern while his brother Eustace entered by the gate. Long after, the wretched Hubert came to ask forgiveness from his brother; and having obtained it, retired to a convent, where he practised penance until he died. The ruins of this castle stand on an eminence to the west of the town.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Egremont",721,729],["Mount",884,889],["Egremont",968,976],["Castle",977,983],["Egremont",1325,1333]],"geonouns":[["gate",7,11],["carriage",16,24],["road",60,64],["gate",86,90],["fell",129,133],["sea",217,220],["islands",276,283],["slopes",438,444],["farm",500,504],["house",505,510],["slopes",574,580],["fields",624,630],["woods",637,642],["mouth",669,674],["vale",682,686],["coast",707,712],["town",740,744],["castle",1594,1600],["tarn",1918,1922],["gate",2058,2062],["castle",2244,2250],["town",2291,2295]],"pos_words":[["pretty",804,810],["cheerful",835,843],["distinguished",908,921],["gallant",1056,1063],["daring",1617,1623],["eminence",2263,2271]],"neg_words":[["dreary",153,159],["bad",177,180],["cloud",254,259],["ragged",338,344],["swelling",429,437],["hollow",464,470],["spite",852,857],["hung",1002,1006],["fall",1245,1249],["blow",1283,1287],["stole",1579,1584],["remorse",1690,1697],["startling",1835,1844],["wild",1883,1887],["wretched",2080,2088],["died",2220,2224],["ruins",2230,2235]],"events":[["Cold",98,102]],"dates":[["crusading days",1011,1025],["one day",1736,1743]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",1345,1352],["home",1569,1573]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",73,81],["over",119,123],["down",298,302],["under",512,517],["away",556,560],["between",562,569],["down",588,592],["below",593,598],["into",619,623],["above",651,656],["between",688,695],["together",1158,1166],["into",1585,1589]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0528846154,"vader_sentiment":-0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985099435},{"para_id":162,"paragraph":"Before descending to Ennerdale Bridge, the outline of the Scotch mountains may be sometimes seen.

Worse happened, in October, 1852, to two gentlemen who went, with a pony, but without a guide, from Buttermere to Wastdale Head, by Scarf Gap and Blacksail. In Ennerdale valley, wind and rain met them. They struggled part of the way along Blacksail, when they became bewildered, and soon so exhausted that they had a narrow escape with their lives. But for a brandy flask, which one of them carried, they could not have survived. The pony seems to have sunk as rapidly as the men. These gentlemen have publicly suggested the erection of some conspicuous landmarks, to show the track; and they have uttered their warning, in corroboration of so many others, against crossing mountains without a guide. One of their chief difficulties was the paths being turned into watercourses, and thereby disguised. It was on the same track that the three Kendal young ladies, mentioned by Mr. Green in his\" Guide\"( two of whom are still living) lost their way, from dismissing their guide too soon, and actually staid all night on the mountain, where, if it had not been fine summer weather, they would have perished. They took a guide over Scarf Gap, and as far as the junction of the three roads from Buttermere, Ennerdale, and Wastdale. The guide left them on the right road, and with full information as to the rest of the way. They took the wrong side of the brook, however, and so got bewildered. It was only four p.m., when the guide left them: but darkness overtook them still wandering. When they came down upon Tyson's house, early in the morning, the family could not believe the story of their descent, so perilous was the way they had come. One of the ladies had, however, lost a pocket-book; and they had seen a dead sheep: and, somebody immediately going up, these incidents were verified; and the adventure of the Kendal ladies remains one of the wonders of the dales.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Kirk Fell",87,96],["Buttermere",198,208],["Wastdale Head",212,225],["Scarf Gap",230,239],["Ennerdale",258,267],["Kendal",940,946],["Scarf Gap",1226,1235],["Buttermere",1288,1298],["Ennerdale",1300,1309],["Wastdale",1315,1323],["Kendal",1915,1921]],"geonouns":[["valley",268,274],["track",675,680],["mountains",772,781],["paths",839,844],["track",919,924],["mountain",1120,1128],["junction",1255,1263],["roads",1277,1282],["road",1358,1362],["brook",1449,1454],["house",1614,1619],["dales",1963,1968]],"pos_words":[["fine",1156,1160],["right",1352,1357],["overtook",1550,1558],["wonders",1948,1955]],"neg_words":[["struggled",305,314],["bewildered",365,375],["exhausted",389,398],["sunk",551,555],["conspicuous",640,651],["warning",710,717],["difficulties",818,830],["lost",1030,1034],["staid",1097,1102],["wrong",1431,1436],["bewildered",1476,1486],["darkness",1541,1549],["perilous",1703,1711],["lost",1771,1775],["dead",1811,1815]],"events":[],"dates":[["a previous day",55,69],["October, 1852",117,130],["summer",1161,1167]],"times":[["all night",1103,1112],["only four p.m.",1495,1509],["early in the morning",1621,1641]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",176,183],["without",782,789],["left",1335,1339],["left",1526,1530]],"spa_preps":[["round",81,86],["along",331,336],["against",755,762],["into",858,862],["over",1221,1225],["down",1596,1600]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0621468927,"vader_sentiment":-0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9911336303},{"para_id":164,"paragraph":"We had once an adventure in this neighbourhood, the moral of which is, the comfort and security of having a guide. We wanted to cross Blake Fell to Loweswater. The distance to Scale Hill Inn was only six miles; the time summer; and the track well marked on map and mountain. If there ever was a case in which a guide might be thought unnecessary, it was this: but two out of the party were young strangers; and the third would not assume the charge of them. The heat was excessive that day; so we lagged behind the guide, on the ascent, though he carried knapsack and baskets. He was a quiet-looking elderly mountaineer, who appeared to walk very slowly; but his progress was great, compared with ours, from the uniformity and continuity of his pace. In the worst part of the walk, we tried the effect of following close behind him, and putting our feet in his tracks; and we were surprised to find with what ease and rapidity we got on. At first we stopped repeatedly, to sit down and drink from the streams that crossed the track, or flowed beside it: and during those halts, we observed that the blackness which had for some time been appearing in the west, now completely shrouded the sea. Next, we remarked that while the wind still blew in our faces,-- that is, from the north-east,-- the mass of western clouds was evidently climbing the sky. The guide quietly observed that there would be rain by and by. Next, when we were in the middle of the wide fell, and we saw how puzzling the network of swampy paths must be at all times, we pointed out to one another how the light fleeces of cloud below the black mass swept round in a circle, following each other like streams in an eddy. Soon, the dark mass came driving up at such a rate that it was clear we should not finish our walk in good weather. The dense mist was presently upon us. On looking behind, to watch its rate of advance, we saw a few flashes of lightning burst from it. The thunder had for some time been growling afar, almost incessantly. The moment before the explosion of the storm was as like a dream as a waking state can be. We were walking on wild ground, now ascending, now descending; a deep tarn( Floutern Tarn) on our right hand, our feet treading on slippery rushes, or still more slippery grass: the air was dark, as during an eclipse; and heavy mists drove past from behind, just at the level of our heads, and sinking every moment; while before us, and far far below us-- down as in a different world-- lay Buttermere and the neighbouring vales sleeping in the calmest sunshine. The contrast was singular-- of that warm picture, with its yellow lights and soft blue shadows, with the turbulence and chill and gloom of the station from which we viewed it. We had but a moment to look at it; for not only did the clouds sink before our eyes, but the wind scudded round to the opposite point of the compass, throwing one after another of us flat as it passed. Within a few minutes, one of us had six falls, from the force of the wind, and the treachery of the ground,-- now, in a trice, a medley of small streams. It was impossible to stop the guide, for a moment's breath. In the roar of the blast, and crash of the thunder, and pelt of the hail, one might as well have spoken to the elements: so it was necessary for us all to keep up our pace, that he might not stride away from us entirely. Through stumblings and slidings innumerable, we did this,-- the lightning playing about our faces the while, like a will-o' - the-wisp on the face of a bog. The hail and rain had drenched us to the skin in three minutes. The first hailstones reached the skin. They were driven in at every opening of our clothes; they cut our necks behind, and filled our shoes. Our hats and bonnets were immediately soaked through, and every body's hair wringing wet. The thunder seemed to roll on our very skulls. In this weather we went plunging on for four miles, through spungy bogs, turbid streams, whose bridges of stones were hidden in the rushing waters; or by narrow pathways, each one of which was converted by the storm into an impetuous brook.

But the attention of the traveller has hardly been sufficiently called to the stormy character of this central district, as shown by the aspect of the mountains. No where else are they so scarred with weather marks, or so diversified in colouring from new rents in the soil. Long sweeps of orange and grey stones descend to Crummock Water; and above, there are large hollows, like craters, filled now with deep blue shadows, and now with tumbling white mists, above which yellow or purple peaks change their hue with every hour of the day, or variation of the sky. The bare, hot-looking d\u00e9bris on the Melbreak side, the chasms in the rocks, and the sudden swellings of the waters, tell of turbulence in all seasons. The most tremendous waterspout remembered in the region of the lakes, descended the ravine between Grassmoor and Whiteside, in 1760. It swept the whole side of Grassmoor at midnight, and carried down everything that was lying loose all through the vale below, and over a piece of arable land at the entrance, where it actually peeled the whole surface, carrying away the soil and the trees, and leaving the rocky substratum completely bare. The soil was many feet deep, and the trees fullgrown. Then it laid down what it brought, covering ten acres with the rubbish. By the channel left, it appears that the flood must have been five or six yards deep, and a hundred yards wide. Among other pranks, it rooted up a solid stone causeway, which was supported by an embankment apparently as strong as the neighbouring hills. The flood not only swept away the whole work, but scooped out the entire line for its own channel. The village of Brackenthwaite, which stood directly in its course, was saved by being built on a stone platform,-- a circumstance unknown to the inhabitants till they now saw themselves left safe on a promontory, while the soft soil was swept away from beside their very doors, leaving a chasm where the flood had been turned aside by the resistance of their rock. The end of the matter was, that the flood poured into the Cocker, which rose so as to lay the whole south-western plain under water for a considerable time.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Buttermere",19,29],["Crummock Water",382,396],["Melbreak",659,667],["Grassmoor",873,882],["Whiteside",887,896],["Grassmoor",934,943],["Brackenthwaite",1709,1723],["Cocker",2117,2123]],"geonouns":[["road",4,8],["district",169,177],["mountains",209,218],["stones",364,370],["hollows",425,432],["peaks",547,552],["rocks",692,697],["waters",731,737],["region",823,829],["lakes",837,842],["vale",1022,1026],["land",1061,1065],["entrance",1073,1081],["trees",1158,1163],["feet",1233,1237],["trees",1252,1257],["channel",1348,1355],["stone",1494,1499],["hills",1588,1593],["line",1668,1672],["channel",1685,1692],["village",1698,1705],["stone",1791,1796],["promontory",1895,1905],["doors",1965,1970],["rock",2053,2057],["water",2185,2190]],"pos_words":[["sufficiently",109,121],["diversified",280,291],["like",434,438],["hot",633,636],["solid",1488,1493],["supported",1520,1529],["strong",1561,1567],["work",1635,1639],["safe",1885,1889],["soft",1917,1921]],"neg_words":[["stormy",136,142],["scarred",246,253],["mists",511,516],["lying",994,999],["loose",1000,1005],["peeled",1101,1107],["rocky",1181,1186],["rubbish",1332,1339],["unknown",1824,1831],["resistance",2033,2043]],"events":[],"dates":[["84",53,55],["all seasons",761,772],["1760",901,905]],"times":[["every hour of the day",575,596],["midnight",947,955],["five or six",1403,1414]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",409,414],["above",518,523],["left",1356,1360],["left",1880,1884]],"spa_preps":[["above",402,407],["between",865,872],["down",969,973],["through",1010,1017],["below",1027,1032],["over",1038,1042],["away",1136,1140],["down",1282,1286],["away",1620,1624],["out",1653,1656],["away",1937,1941],["beside",1947,1953],["aside",2020,2025],["into",2108,2112],["under",2179,2184]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984355569},{"para_id":169,"paragraph":"On leaving Buttermere, and passing the very small chapel( which yet is\" quite big\" compared with the former one on the same site) the road up Buttermere Haws to Newlands is seen ascending to the left.

Formerly, the slate was brought down on hurdles, on men's backs: and the practice is still continued in some remote quarries, where the expense of conveyance by carts would be too great, or the roads do not admit of it. Nearly forty years ago there was a man named Joseph Clark at Honister, who made seventeen journeys,( including seventeen miles of climbing up and scrambling down,) in one day, bringing down 10,880 pounds of slate. In ascending he carried the hurdle, weighing eighty pounds; and in descending, he brought each time 640 pounds of slate. At another time he carried, in three successive journeys, 1,280 pounds each time. His greatest day's work was bringing 11,771 pounds; in how many journeys it is not remembered: but in fewer than seventeen. He lived at Stonethwaite, three miles from his place of work.

She disintegrates the rocks, and now and then sends down masses thundering along the ravines, to bridge over a chasm, or make a new islet in a pool. She sows her seeds in crevices, or on little projections, so that the bare face of the precipice becomes feathered with the rowan and the birch: and thus, ere long, motion is produced by the passing winds, in a scene where all once appeared rigid as a mine. She draws her carpet of verdure gradually up the bare slopes, where she has deposited earth to sustain the vegetation. She is for ever covering with her exquisite mosses and ferns every spot which has been left unsightly, till nothing appears that can offend the human eye, within a whole circle of hills. She even silently rebukes and repairs the false taste of uneducated man. If he makes his dwelling of too glaring a white, she tempers it with weatherstains: if he indolently leaves the stone walls and blue slates unrelieved by any neighbouring vegetation, she supplies the needful screen by bringing out tufts of delicate fern in the crevices, and springing coppice on the nearest slopes. -- The most significant changes, however, are in the disposition of the waters of the region. The margins of the lakes never remain the same for half a century together. The streams bring down soft soil incessantly; and this more effectually alters the currents than the slides of stones precipitated from the heights by an occasional storm. By this deposit of soil new promontories are formed, and the margin contracts till many a reach of waters is converted into land, inviting tillage. The greenest levels of the smaller valleys may be seen to have been once lakes: and no one who looks down upon Grasmere, for instance, from the hill field behind the Hollins, can have any doubt as to what was once the extent of the waters. And, while Nature is thus closing up in one direction, she is opening in another. In some low-lying spot a tree falls, which acts as a dam when the next rains come. The detained waters sink, and penetrate, and loosen the roots of other trees; and the moisture which they formerly absorbed goes to swell the accumulation till the place becomes a swamp. The drowned vegetation decays and sinks, leaving more room, till the place becomes a pool, on whose bristling margin the snipe arrives to rock on the bulrush, and the heron wades in the waterlilies to feed on the fish which come there, nobody knows how. As the waters spread, they encounter natural dams, behind which they grow clear and deepen, till we have a tarn among the hills, which attracts the browsing flock, and tempts the shepherd to build his hut near the brink. Then the wild swans see the glittering expanse in their flight, and drop down into it; and the waterfowl make their nests among the reeds. This brings the sportsman; and a path is trodden over the hills; and the spot becomes a place of human resort. While nature is thus working transformations in her deeper retreats, the generations of men are more obviously busy elsewhere. They build their houses, and plant their orchards on the slopes which connect the mountains with the levels of the valleys: they encroach upon the swamps below them, and plough among the stones on the uplands,-- here fencing in new grounds, there throwing several plots into one: they open slate quarries, and make broad roads for the carriage of the produce: they cherish the young hollies and ash, whose sprouts feed their flocks, thus providing a compensation in the future for the past destruction of the woods. Thus, while the general primitive aspect of the region remains, and its intensely rural character is little impaired, there is perhaps scarcely a valley in the district which looks the same from one half - century to another.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Grasmere",1881,1889]],"geonouns":[["mountains",153,162],["rocks",200,205],["bridge",275,281],["precipice",414,423],["slopes",639,645],["hills",884,889],["stone",1076,1081],["walls",1082,1087],["coppice",1249,1256],["slopes",1272,1278],["waters",1352,1358],["region",1366,1372],["lakes",1393,1398],["streams",1454,1461],["stones",1561,1567],["promontories",1650,1662],["waters",1721,1727],["land",1746,1750],["valleys",1805,1812],["lakes",1843,1848],["hill",1914,1918],["field",1919,1924],["waters",2002,2008],["tree",2117,2121],["waters",2188,2194],["trees",2246,2251],["rock",2500,2504],["waters",2623,2629],["tarn",2723,2727],["hills",2738,2743],["path",3009,3013],["hills",3034,3039],["houses",3231,3237],["slopes",3271,3277],["mountains",3296,3305],["valleys",3329,3336],["stones",3401,3407],["grounds",3446,3453],["quarries",3510,3518],["roads",3535,3540],["carriage",3549,3557],["woods",3723,3728],["region",3778,3784],["valley",3876,3882],["district",3890,3898]],"pos_words":[["quiet",82,87],["exquisite",738,747],["delicate",1204,1212],["significant",1292,1303],["soft",1473,1477],["clear",2690,2695],["cherish",3579,3586]],"neg_words":[["wrought",37,44],["inevitable",98,108],["disintegrates",182,195],["rigid",568,573],["offend",837,843],["false",933,938],["incessantly",1483,1494],["doubt",1958,1963],["lying",2104,2109],["falls",2122,2127],["sink",2195,2199],["wild",2846,2850],["encroach",3343,3351],["destruction",3704,3715],["primitive",3754,3763],["impaired",3838,3846],["scarcely",3865,3873]],"events":[],"dates":[["half a century",1425,1439],["one half - century",3925,3943]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",791,795],["within",859,865],["behind",1925,1931],["there",2591,2596],["behind",2667,2673],["elsewhere",3203,3212],["below",3368,3373],["here",3426,3430],["there",3455,3460],["past",3699,3703],["there",3848,3853]],"spa_preps":[["down",230,234],["along",253,258],["over",282,286],["out",1191,1194],["together",1440,1448],["down",1468,1472],["into",1741,1745],["down",1871,1875],["among",2728,2733],["near",2821,2825],["down",2910,2914],["into",2915,2919],["among",2959,2964],["over",3025,3029],["among",3391,3396],["into",3484,3488]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0280112045,"vader_sentiment":-0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9971618652},{"para_id":175,"paragraph":"The changes among the people proceed faster: and some of these changes are less agreeable to contemplate, however well aware we may be that they are to issue in good. Formerly, every household had nearly all that it wanted within itself. The people thought so little of wheaten bread that wheat was hardly to be bought in the towns. Within the last few years, an old man of eighty - five was fond of talking how, when a boy, he wanted to spend his penny on wheaten bread; and he searched through Carlisle from morning to evening before he could find a penny roll. The cultivator among the hills divided his field into plots, where he grew barley, oats, flax, and other produce, to meet the needs of his household. His pigs, fed partly on acorns or beech mast, yielded good bacon and hams; and his sheep furnished wool for clothing. Of course he kept cows. The women spun and wove the wool and flax, and the lads made the wooden utensils, baskets, fishing tackle,&amp; c. Whatever else was needed was obtained from the pedlars, who came their rounds two or three times a-year, dropping in among the little farms from over the hills. The first great change was from the opening of carriage roads. There was a temptation then to carry stock and grain to fairs and markets. More grain was grown than the household needed, and offered for sale. In a little while the mountain farmers were sure to fail in competition in the markets with dwellers in agricultural districts. The mountaineer had no agricultural science, and little skill; and the decline of the fortunes of the\" statesmen,\" as they are locally called, has been regular, and mournful to witness. They haunt the fairs and markets, losing in proportion to the advance of improvement elsewhere. On their first losses, they began to mortgage their lands. After bearing the burden of these mortgages till they could bear it no longer, their children have sold the lands: and among the shopboys, domestic servants, and labourers of the town, we find the names of the former yeomanry of the district, who have parted with their lands to strangers. Much misery intervened during the process of transition. The farmer was tempted to lose the remembrance of his losses in drink when he attended the fairs and markets. The capacity of the dalesmen in this respect,-- in the quantity of strong liquor that they can carry-- is remarkable; and they have only too good a training. Spirits are introduced on all occasions. At sales, of which there are many, every spring and autumn, in the dales, and which are attended by all the inhabitants who can go, for miles round,-- glasses of spirit are handed round among the purchasers, all day long. The settling of accounts at Candlemas is attended by the same curse,-- every debtor expecting his creditor to offer him the compliment of a glass of strong liquor. On that day, it is unpleasant to ladies to be abroad, near settlements where the Candlemas payments are making,-- so many are the drunken people whom they meet. It is common to swallow the strong liquor undiluted, in considerable quantity. An old dalesman, welcome in Ambleside for his shrewdness, simplicity and originality, appeared one day at a house where the gentleman was absent, but the lady at home. The lady asked the visitor to sit down and await her husband's return, proposing to offer him some spirit and water meantime. He replied he wonnot be nice about t' first part e' t' offer, but as tot' watter, it could be gitten at ony gate( way) side.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",496,504],["Ambleside",3119,3128]],"geonouns":[["towns",326,331],["hills",589,594],["field",607,612],["farms",1105,1110],["hills",1125,1130],["carriage",1179,1187],["roads",1188,1193],["markets",1261,1268],["mountain",1362,1370],["markets",1419,1426],["districts",1457,1466],["markets",1679,1686],["lands",1802,1807],["lands",1917,1922],["town",1988,1992],["district",2042,2050],["lands",2079,2084],["markets",2257,2264],["dales",2532,2537],["common",3018,3024],["house",3199,3204],["water",3369,3374],["gate",3493,3497]],"pos_words":[["faster",37,43],["agreeable",80,89],["well",114,118],["good",161,165],["fond",392,396],["good",768,772],["great",1142,1147],["skill",1524,1529],["improvement",1727,1738],["strong",2333,2339],["remarkable",2372,2382],["good",2407,2411],["compliment",2811,2821],["strong",2836,2842],["strong",3040,3046],["welcome",3108,3115],["originality",3164,3175],["nice",3409,3413]],"neg_words":[["issue",152,157],["pigs",718,722],["temptation",1207,1217],["fail",1392,1396],["decline",1539,1546],["mournful",1633,1641],["haunt",1659,1664],["losing",1688,1694],["losses",1765,1771],["burden",1827,1833],["misery",2104,2110],["lose",2182,2186],["losses",2210,2216],["unpleasant",2870,2880],["drunken",2981,2988]],"events":[],"dates":[["the last few years",340,358],["a-year",1068,1074],["the\"",1566,1570],["spring and",2506,2516],["autumn",2517,2523],["all day long",2673,2685],["that day",2854,2862],["one day",3186,3193]],"times":[["morning to evening",510,528],["The first",1132,1141]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["within",223,229],["elsewhere",1739,1748],["there",2484,2489],["abroad",2897,2903],["home",3253,3257]],"spa_preps":[["among",12,17],["through",488,495],["among",579,584],["into",613,617],["among",1088,1093],["over",1116,1120],["among",1928,1933],["round",2645,2650],["among",2651,2656],["near",2905,2909],["down",3293,3297],["about",3414,3419]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0093167702,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9922471046},{"para_id":176,"paragraph":"To return to the former condition of the\" statesman.\" The domestic manufactures he carried to town with him,-- the linen and woolen webs woven by his wife and daughters,-- would not sell, except at a loss, in the presence of the Yorkshire and Lancashire woollens and cottons made by machinery.

Elsewhere, the causes of this are understood, and cow and milk are treated accordingly. Not so here. The cow is at once concluded to be bewitched; and it si apprehended that she will spread the witchery to the whole dairy. So, instead of any sensible method, the remedy tried is depositing in the cowhouse some soil from the nearest churchyard. As it is probable that this fails, time is lost in other proceedings. Stirring with a stick from the rowan tree is one of the least troublesome. If the cows are distempered, it is actually a practice in many of the dales to light the\" need fire.\" Notice being given throughout the neighbouring valleys, that the charm may be sent for it wanted, the need fire is produced by rubbing two sticks together. A great pile of combustible stuff is prepared; and the more smoke it can be made to give the better. When lighted the neighbours snatch some of the fire to hurry home with, and light their respective piles. The cattle, diseased and sound, are then driven through the fire, as some of the Irish, by a remnant of paganism, charm their property, and even their children, by passing or snatching them through the fire, making strangers ask whether Moloch is acknowledged there still. It is said, in a certain Cumberland dale, that when a farmer had driven all his other live property through, he proceeded to drive his wife after the cows, saying he should then be safe from all distempers. If a cock crows in the night, horror and grief seize on the household:-- some one is sure to die. If people meet a black ram, they turn their money for luck. They occupy their minds and waste their time in the silliest superstitions which keep true knowledge out. For the result, look at the productions of the region,-- the torn and dirty wool, the sapless and scentless hay, allowed first to run to seed, and then to lie soaking and parching for weeks in the field,-- the flour, the meat, the butter, the cheese,-- look at any of these products in the more retired vales, and say whether intercourse with the world outside will not be a good thing for the fortunes of those within. To take only the last,-- the cheese. After coming from the other grazing districts, and seeing how scientific a matter the management of a dairy has become, and what the best cheese is, the dairy management of Cumberland is marvellous. Our readers cannot be expected to believe the facts without good testimony: and we may refer them to such local publications as the\" Lonsdale Magazine,\" where,( in Vol. ii. p. 13.) we are told that the Cumberland cheese is harder than buck-horn: and that in some places where the husbandmen wear clogs shod with iron, it is no uncommon thing to supply the absence of the iron with the crust of a dry cheese. There is plenty of testimony to cheese striking fire like a flint. A soldier used a cheese paring for a flint; and a blacksmith at Cartmel avered that he struck sparks from a cheese while cutting it up with an axe. A tract of dry heather burned without intermission for three weeks, having been kindled by sparks from a cheese which had rolled from a cart on the road above, and bounded from crag to crag. These things are like the barbarism of two centuries ago. It is the railroad that must mend them. In a generation or two, the dale farms may yield wool that Yorkshire and Lancashire, and perhaps other countries, may compete for. The cheese may find a market, and the butter may be in request. And at the same time, the residents may find their health improved by the greater wholesomeness of their food; and, before that, their minds will have become stirred and enlarged by intercourse with strangers who have, from circumstances, more vivacity of faculty and a wider knowledge. The best, as well as the last and greatest change in the Lake District is that which is arising from the introduction of the railroad.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",1340,1350],["Cumberland",2416,2426],["Cumberland",2644,2654],["Cartmel",2981,2988],["Yorkshire",3413,3422],["Lancashire",3427,3437],["Lake District",3893,3906]],"geonouns":[["valleys",16,23],["tree",539,543],["dales",647,652],["valleys",726,733],["dale",1351,1355],["vales",2089,2094],["districts",2279,2288],["road",3213,3217],["crag",3242,3246],["crag",3250,3254],["dale",3382,3386],["farms",3387,3392],["countries",3457,3466],["market",3507,3513]],"pos_words":[["sensible",329,337],["remedy",350,356],["charm",744,749],["great",837,842],["better",928,934],["charm",1156,1161],["safe",1496,1500],["luck",1674,1678],["good",2161,2165],["best",2376,2380],["marvellous",2430,2440],["good",2502,2506],["striking",2889,2897],["like",2903,2907],["like",3273,3277],["improved",3607,3615],["best",3840,3844],["well",3849,3853],["greatest",3870,3878]],"neg_words":[["trouble",29,36],["fails",460,465],["lost",475,479],["troublesome",564,575],["smoke",895,900],["grief",1563,1568],["die",1615,1618],["waste",1708,1713],["dirty",1856,1861],["lie",1941,1944],["clogs",2738,2743],["absence",2798,2805],["struck",3004,3010],["burned",3088,3094]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",662,666],["weeks",1970,1975],["the\"",2570,2574],["three weeks",3120,3131],["two centuries ago",3295,3312]],"times":[["the night",1541,1550]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",182,186],["throughout",698,708],["together",825,833],["home",997,1001],["there",1302,1307],["outside",2139,2146],["without",2494,2501],["without",3095,3102]],"spa_preps":[["through",1090,1097],["through",1232,1239],["through",1415,1422],["out",1781,1784],["within",2198,2204],["above",3218,3223]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0144927536,"vader_sentiment":0.9,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9986919761},{"para_id":179,"paragraph":"Part Iv.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9646454453},{"para_id":180,"paragraph":"Passes.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9910825491},{"para_id":181,"paragraph":"Langdale, From Borrowdale, By The Stake Pass. -- Path To Easedale. -- Path To Eskhause.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Langdale",0,8],["Borrowdale",15,25],["The Stake",30,39],["Easedale",57,65]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981287122},{"para_id":182,"paragraph":"The top of the Stake Pass is five miles and a-half from Rosthwaite.

This is truly a glorious mountain walk. From Esk Hause, there is a singular view, composed of three lines of landscape. One begins with Borrowdale, lying immediately below, and extends to Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite, past Skiddaw, in full glory, and on over the whole intervening plain, to the Solway and the Scotch mountains. This is the north-western view. -- The opposite, or south-eastern one, begins with Langdale, and proceeds by the opening of the Brathay valley and Windermere, till it is closed in by Ingleborough, in Yorkshire. -- The third, and intermediate view, is down Eskdale, past its verdure and its cataracts, past the sands, past lonely Blackcombe, to the broad sea. When we were on Esk Hause, the spectacle of these three lines of landscape was remarkable. Towards Keswick, the atmosphere was thick, just to the degree that gave a visionary character to the long perspective. The lake of Derwentwater was hardly distinguishable from its shores, so that the wooded islands and the town of Keswick lay as if in air, still and unsubstantial. In the direction of Eskdale, all was bright and glittering; while from Langdale and the head of Borrowdale the white mists came tumbling out towards us, as if to stifle us; and nothing could be seen, except at intervals, when a whiff of wind disclosed long sweeps of the sides of the valleys, and stretches of the streams and fields below. It is these changes that give a singular charm to this mountain district. The residents of the valleys, in their occasional ascents to these heights, never see the scene twice alike,-- the great landmarks themselves being scarcely recognizable but by certain incidents of their forms.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Langdale",35,43],["Stake",95,100],["Stake",219,224],["Hause",250,255],["Sprinkling Tarn",260,275],["Sty Head",283,291],["Hause",347,352],["Borrowdale",434,444],["Derwentwater",486,498],["Bassenthwaite",503,516],["Skiddaw",523,530],["Solway",595,601],["Langdale",711,719],["Brathay",756,763],["Windermere",775,785],["Ingleborough",811,823],["Yorkshire",828,837],["Eskdale",884,891],["Hause",1007,1012],["Keswick",1086,1093],["Derwentwater",1209,1221],["Keswick",1309,1316],["Eskdale",1380,1387],["Langdale",1431,1439],["Borrowdale",1456,1466]],"geonouns":[["path",27,31],["road",101,105],["track",231,236],["mountain",323,331],["lines",398,403],["landscape",407,416],["mountains",617,626],["valley",764,770],["cataracts",918,927],["sands",938,943],["sea",982,985],["lines",1043,1048],["landscape",1052,1061],["lake",1201,1205],["shores",1258,1264],["islands",1285,1292],["town",1301,1305],["head",1448,1452],["valleys",1644,1651],["streams",1674,1681],["fields",1686,1692],["mountain",1755,1763],["district",1764,1772],["valleys",1795,1802]],"pos_words":[["right",113,118],["leads",237,242],["glorious",314,322],["glory",540,545],["remarkable",1066,1076],["visionary",1152,1161],["bright",1397,1403],["charm",1741,1746],["great",1889,1894]],"neg_words":[["rough",21,26],["stranger",183,191],["lying",446,451],["lonely",950,956],["mists",1477,1482],["stifle",1522,1528],["scarcely",1922,1930]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",83,87],["there",354,359],["past",518,522],["opposite",667,675],["past",893,897],["past",929,933],["past",945,949]],"spa_preps":[["below",464,469],["over",554,558],["down",879,883],["out",1497,1500],["below",1693,1698]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0114942529,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988535643},{"para_id":191,"paragraph":"Ii.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["Ii.",0,3]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9879697561},{"para_id":192,"paragraph":"Sty Head Pass, From Wastdale To Borrowdale.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Sty Head",0,8],["Wastdale",20,28],["Borrowdale",32,42]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977687597},{"para_id":193,"paragraph":"We have noticed the eastern prong of the fork into which Glaramara divides the head of Borrowdale.

Here are large flocks of sheep; and anciently were mines of lead and copper. Here also, in a very high and perpendidular rock called Eagle Crag, is every year an eyrie or nest of eagles.\" So says the old history. But the traveller will find no swine near Sty Head now, summer or winter. No creature comes to drink at the tarn,-- the little clear rippling lake, where the mountaineer throws himself down to rest on the bank, when heated by the ascent from the vales. He has found everything sunny and dry, perhaps; but here he sees, by the minute diamond drops resting thick on the grass, that a cloud has lately stooped from its course, and refreshed the verdure in this retreat. It looks very tempting-- this bright sheet of water; but no creature now comes to drink, unless a sheep may have strayed far from the flock, and in its terror may yet venture to stoop to the water, with many a start and interval of listening, till, at the faint sound of the distant sheep dog, it bounds away. The solitude is almost equally impressive whether the traveller comes up from the one dale or the other; but perhaps the most striking to him who comes from Wastdale, because he has rather more lately left the dwellings of men. He ascends from Wastdale Head, by the steep path clearly visible from below, up the side of Great Gable. At the top of the pass, the view behind is extremely fine,-- the dale lying 1,000 feet below, while the precipices of Scawfell rise 2,000 feet over head. The rill from Sprinkling Tarn is close by, and it leads to this Sty Head Tarn, where the boars used to come to drink. Long after the boars were gone, the eagles came hither: and this was one of their last haunts. The eagles which gave their name to the crag in Borrowdale, being disturbed, settled themselves on a rock at Seathwaite, and at length crossed the ridge into Eskdale. The disturbance was of course from the shepherds, who lost so many lambs as to be driven desperate against the birds. There was no footing on the crag by which the nest could be reached; so a man was lowered by a rope sixty yards down the precipice. He carried his mountain staff with him; its spiked end being the best weapon against the birds. He did not expect to kill the old ones; but year after year the eggs or the young were taken. If he brought the young away alive he had the birds for his pains: if the eggs, every shepherd gave five shillings for every egg. It is said that no more than two eggs were ever found at one time. The nest was made of twigs, and lined with a sort of grass from the clefts of the rock. When the fowler failed, and the eaglets were reared, they were led away, as soon as strong enough, by the parent birds,-- no doubt to settle in some other spot; and the parents returned without them. One of this pair was shot at by the master of a sheep dog which had been actually carried some distance into the air by it, escaping only by its flesh giving way. The shot took effect, but the eagle vanished. About a week after, it was found lying on the grass on the uplands at Seatoller, nearly starved. Its bill had been split by the shot, and the tongue was set fast in the cleft: it could not make much resistance, and was carried home captive. But, when relieved and restored, it became so violent that it was necessarily killed. Its mate brought a successor from a distance, a much smaller bird, and of a different species. They built, however, for fourteen more years in Borrowdale, before they flew over to Eskdale. They were not long left in peace there; and, when the larger bird was at length shot, his mate disappeared entirely. Such devastation as was caused by these birds is not heard of now; but while there are crags aloft and lambs in the vales, there will be more or fewer, nobler or meaner, birds of prey. We are unable to ascertain positively, amidst conflicting testimony, whether any eagles at all remain in the region. It appears that one has certainly been seen within ten years; and three gentlemen, two of whom are travelled men, and not likely to be mistaken in such a matter, declare that, four years ago, they saw one sweep down from Scandale Fell into Kirkstone Pass, and rest on a crag in the vale, some way above Brothers' Water. There is, however, a preponderance of disbelief of there being now any nest and settlement of eagles among the mountains of Westmorland and Cumberland.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Borrowdale",26,36],["Wastdale",170,178],["Sty Head",218,226],["Eagle Crag",487,497],["Sty Head",609,617],["Wastdale",1501,1509],["Wastdale Head",1588,1601],["Great Gable",1664,1675],["Scawfell",1795,1803],["Sprinkling Tarn",1845,1860],["Sty Head",1895,1903],["Borrowdale",2092,2102],["Seathwaite",2153,2163],["Eskdale",2202,2209],["Seatoller",3415,3424],["Borrowdale",3815,3825],["Eskdale",3852,3859],["Kirkstone Pass",4520,4534],["Brothers' Water",4583,4598],["Westmorland",4724,4735],["Cumberland",4740,4750]],"geonouns":[["hill",191,195],["dale",311,315],["rock",475,479],["lake",709,713],["bank",772,776],["vales",813,818],["water",1080,1085],["water",1225,1230],["dale",1430,1434],["path",1616,1620],["pass",1695,1699],["dale",1742,1746],["precipices",1781,1791],["head",1825,1829],["crag",2084,2088],["rock",2145,2149],["ridge",2191,2196],["crag",2357,2361],["precipice",2450,2459],["mountain",2476,2484],["rock",2930,2934],["crags",4065,4070],["vales",4094,4099],["region",4272,4278],["crag",4550,4554],["vale",4562,4566],["mountains",4711,4720]],"pos_words":[["lead",414,418],["clear",694,699],["refreshed",995,1004],["bright",1064,1070],["impressive",1375,1385],["striking",1470,1478],["clearly",1621,1628],["top",1684,1687],["leads",1881,1886],["best",2526,2530],["led",2999,3002],["strong",3020,3026],["enough",3027,3033],["master",3172,3178],["fast",3502,3506],["restored",3609,3617],["peace",3888,3893],["positively",4190,4200]],"neg_words":[["wild",103,107],["haunt",146,151],["fall",281,285],["cloud",949,954],["retreat",1025,1032],["terror",1186,1192],["faint",1290,1295],["steep",1610,1615],["lying",1747,1752],["disturbed",2110,2119],["disturbance",2215,2226],["lost",2265,2269],["desperate",2300,2309],["kill",2578,2582],["pains",2711,2716],["failed",2952,2958],["doubt",3061,3066],["lying",3378,3383],["split",3460,3465],["resistance",3544,3554],["violent",3632,3639],["killed",3664,3670],["devastation",3983,3994],["unable",4170,4176],["conflicting",4209,4220],["mistaken",4415,4423],["disbelief",4638,4647]],"events":[],"dates":[["the summer",265,275],["autumn",294,300],["every year",502,512],["summer",623,629],["winter",633,639],["year",2601,2605],["year",2612,2616],["About a week",3345,3357],["fourteen more years",3792,3811],["ten years",4331,4340],["four years ago",4456,4470]],"times":[["the minute",889,899]],"distances":[["1,000 feet",1753,1763],["2,000 feet",1809,1819]],"loc_advs":[["above",196,201],["near",604,608],["here",872,876],["left",1545,1549],["behind",1710,1716],["hither",1997,2003],["without",3122,3129],["home",3572,3576],["left",3880,3884],["there",3894,3899],["there",4055,4060],["there",4101,4106],["within",4324,4330],["above",4577,4582],["there",4651,4656]],"spa_preps":[["down",286,290],["into",301,305],["down",752,756],["away",1338,1342],["below",1642,1647],["below",1764,1769],["over",1820,1824],["close",1864,1869],["into",2197,2201],["against",2310,2317],["down",2441,2445],["against",2538,2545],["away",2675,2679],["away",3003,3007],["into",3240,3244],["over",3844,3848],["amidst",4202,4208],["down",4491,4495],["into",4515,4519],["among",4701,4706]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0206896552,"vader_sentiment":-0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9972888231},{"para_id":196,"paragraph":"The descent upon Stockley bridge is easy; and the bridge itself was, a few years since, a favourite subject for sketches.

From Esk Hause the summit of the Pike is visible; but still, care is necessary not to ascend the wrong summit. There are four summits which collectively go under the name of Scawfell; viz, the most southerly, which is called simply Scawfell; Scawfell Pike, which is sixty feet higher, and the highest mountain in England( 3,160 feet:) and the lower hills, Lingmell and Great End,-- the last being the northernmost, and fronting Borrowdale. The Ordnance surveyors set up a staff on a pile of stones on the highest peak; so that there need be no mistake henceforth. The two summits are about three - quarters of a-mile apart, in a straight line; but the great chasm between them, called Mickledore, renders a wide circuit necessary. There have been fool-hardy persons who have passed Mickledore without losing their lives; and there are strangers, almost every season, who attempt the ascent without a guide. These last usually pay the penalty of their rashness in hours of uneasy wandering and excessive fatigue. When they think they see their way clearly enough, they are pretty sure to find themselves brought up on the verge of a chasm, and com - pelled to\" try round\" many times before they succeed.

No mountain in the district is, we believe, so often climbed. Its central situation renders the view attractive on every account; it is very conspicuous; and it is not difficult to ascent. According to the Ordnance Surveyors, its height is 3,055 feet above the level of the sea; that is, 33 feet higher than Skiddaw, and rather more than 100 feet lower than Scawfell Pike. There are three modes of ascent from the Grasmere side;-- the one by Grisedale Tarn: another from Wythburn; and a third further on from Legberthwaite. The one from Wythburn is the shortest, but by much the steepest,-- the track beginning at once to climb the hill opposite Nag's Head. The gushing stream which crosses the mail road near the Nag's Head comes down from Brownrigg's well,-- the spring which refreshes the traveller on his way up or down,-- bursting from the mountain side within 300 yards of the summit. There are two cairns on two summits, not far apart, from which, in an angle in the hill, the best view to the north is obtained. These Men,( as such piles of stones are called) mark the dividing line between Cumberland and Westmorland. Northwards, the view is bounded by the Scotch mountains, with the Solway at their feet. Nearer stands Saddleback, with Skiddaw a little to the left. Kepel Cove Tarn lies below, with Catchedecam on the right. Eastwards, Red Tarn lies immediately below, between its two solemn precipices. Ullswater shines beyond, its nearer bank fringed by Gowbarrow Park; and Crossfell closes in the view afar. The Troutbeck mountains here peep over Striding Edge. Kirkstone and Fairfield rise to the south; and over the latter, there is a peep at Windermere, and sometimes, in clear weather, a glimpse of Lancaster Castle. Esthwaite Water and the sea in Morecambe Bay are seen at the same time. Blackcombe is caught sight of through Wrynose Gap; and the Coniston range and Langdale Pikes lead the eye round to the superior summits at the head of Wastdale and Buttermere. Even Honister Crag is seen, in a hollow, a little to the left of Cat Bells. Derwentwater is not seen: nor, from the higher Man, either Thirlmere or Bassenthwaite; though the two last are visible from the lower Man. Six lakes are seen, besides many tarns:-- Ullswater, Windermere, Esthwaite Water, Coniston, Bassenthwaite and Thirlmere. Angle Tarn is particularly conspicuous, while its neighbour, Hays Water, is hidden in its hollow under High Street. The streams it sends down to Brothers' Water are however, very conspicuous when the sun is upon them.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",408,415],["Scawfell",458,466],["Pike",467,471],["Grasmere",514,522],["Grisedale Tarn",542,556],["Wythburn",571,579],["Legberthwaite",609,622],["Wythburn",637,645],["Nag's Head",746,756],["Nag's Head",814,824],["Cumberland",1199,1209],["Westmorland",1214,1225],["Solway",1293,1299],["Saddleback",1329,1339],["Skiddaw",1346,1353],["Cove",1382,1386],["Catchedecam",1409,1420],["Red Tarn",1446,1454],["Ullswater",1514,1523],["Gowbarrow Park",1566,1580],["Crossfell",1586,1595],["Troutbeck",1625,1634],["Striding Edge",1660,1673],["Kirkstone",1675,1684],["Fairfield",1689,1698],["Windermere",1758,1768],["Lancaster Castle",1816,1832],["Esthwaite Water",1834,1849],["Morecambe Bay",1865,1878],["Wrynose Gap",1944,1955],["Coniston",1965,1973],["Langdale Pikes",1984,1998],["Wastdale",2057,2065],["Buttermere",2070,2080],["Honister Crag",2087,2100],["Cat Bells",2147,2156],["Derwentwater",2158,2170],["Thirlmere",2217,2226],["Bassenthwaite",2230,2243],["Ullswater",2339,2348],["Windermere",2350,2360],["Esthwaite Water",2362,2377],["Coniston",2379,2387],["Bassenthwaite",2389,2402],["Thirlmere",2407,2416],["Angle Tarn",2418,2428],["Hays Water",2479,2489],["High Street",2521,2532],["Brothers' Water",2563,2578]],"geonouns":[["precipices",10,20],["summit",40,46],["slopes",68,74],["mountain",103,111],["district",119,127],["sea",374,377],["track",695,700],["hill",732,736],["stream",770,776],["road",800,804],["mountain",945,953],["summit",983,989],["summits",1019,1026],["hill",1074,1078],["stones",1149,1155],["line",1186,1190],["mountains",1273,1282],["feet",1309,1313],["precipices",1502,1512],["bank",1550,1554],["mountains",1635,1644],["sea",1858,1861],["summits",2034,2041],["head",2049,2053],["lakes",2301,2306],["streams",2538,2545]],"pos_words":[["attractive",201,211],["best",1084,1088],["right",1428,1433],["clear",1788,1793],["lead",1999,2003],["superior",2025,2033]],"neg_words":[["conspicuous",241,252],["difficult",268,277],["lies",1392,1396],["lies",1455,1459],["solemn",1495,1501],["hollow",2115,2121],["conspicuous",2445,2456],["hollow",2508,2514],["conspicuous",2597,2608]],"events":[],"dates":[["the spring",861,871]],"times":[],"distances":[["3,055 feet",340,350],["33 feet",388,395],["more than 100 feet",428,446]],"loc_advs":[["within",959,965],["left",1370,1374],["afar",1615,1619],["here",1645,1649],["there",1739,1744],["left",2139,2143]],"spa_preps":[["above",351,356],["opposite",737,745],["near",805,809],["down",831,835],["apart",1036,1041],["between",1191,1198],["below",1397,1402],["below",1472,1477],["between",1479,1486],["beyond",1531,1537],["over",1655,1659],["over",1722,1726],["through",1936,1943],["round",2012,2017],["under",2515,2520],["down",2555,2559]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0119047619,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987117052},{"para_id":215,"paragraph":"Vi.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9946789742},{"para_id":216,"paragraph":"Coniston Old Man. -- Walna Scar.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Coniston",0,8],["Old Man",9,16],["Walna Scar",21,31]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9755648375},{"para_id":217,"paragraph":"There is one more which the tourist would not excuse our omitting.

When the traveller has left the bright and prosperous environs of Coniston behind him, and entered upon the moor, he begins to feel at once the exhilaration of the mountaineer. Behind him lies a wide extent of hilly country, subsiding into the low blue ridges of Lancashire. Below him he sees, when he turns, here and there a reach of the Lake of Coniston,-- gray, if his walk be, as it should be, in the morning: gray, and reflecting the dark promontories in a perfect mirror. Amidst the grassy undulations of the moor, he sees, here or there, a party of peat-cutters, with their crate: and their white horse, if the sun be out, looks absolutely glittering, in contrast with the brownness of the ground. It is truly a wild moor; but there is something wilder to come. The Coniston Mountain towers to the right,-- and the only traces of human existence that can be perceived are the tracks which wind along and up its slopes,-- the paths to the coppermine,-- and a solitary house, looking very desolate among its bare fields and fences. The precipice called Dow( or Dhu) Crag appears in front ere long; and then the traveller must turn to the right, and get up the steep mountain side to the top, as he best may. Where Dow Crag and the Old Man join, a dark and solemn tarn lies beneath the precipice, as he will see from above, whence it lies due west, far below. Round three sides of this Gait's Tarn, the rock is precipitous; and on the other, the crags are piled in grotesque fashion, and so as to afford,-- as does much of this side of the mountain,-- a great harbourage for foxes, against which the neighbouring population are for ever waging war. The summit is the edge of a line of rocks overhanging another tarn,-- Low Water,-- which is 2,000 feet above the sea level, while the summit of the Old Man is 2,632. On this rock, a\" Man\" formerly stood; but it was removed by the Ordnance Surveyors, who erected another, much inferior in convenience; for the first contained a chamber, welcome to shepherds and tourists overtaken by bad weather. The mountain consists chiefly of a very fine roofing slate, from which a large tract of country is supplied, and in which a very important trade was formerly carried on. Several of the quarries are now deserted. From the earliest recorded times, there have been works here for the extraction of copper; and at present it is no unusual thing for \u00a3 2,000 per month to be paid away in wages. The works commence at about half a-mile up the mountain, on its east side; and there is a large estab - lishment of sheds, shops and offices, clustered at the upper end of a basin among the hills. If the traveller desires to explore the mines, he can descend on that side of the mountain. Meantime, looking abroad from his perch, he sees,( beginning from Gait's Tarn) Devoke Water, in a line with Gait's Tarn, to the west. It is said that the trout in that lake are the best known; and tradition declares that the comfortable abbots of Furness imported them from Italy. There is a fine stretch of sea visible, with the Isle of Man, conspicuous in good weather. We need not recapitulate the names of the chief mountains. Suffice it that Ingleborough is visible in one direction, and Lancaster Castle again in another; and in clear weather, Snowdon. The number of tarns within view is remarkable. We have mentioned Gait's Tarn and Low Water. Beyond the latter lies Seathwaite Tarn, whence the infant Duddon issues. Stickle Tarn is conspicuous, lying under Pavey Ark. In a hollow of the mountain, on its north-east side, lies Lowes Water. Only the nearer lakes are seen; but there is a glorious stretch of sea; and, when the estuaries are full, the coast is a beautiful spectacle. The shores of Coniston and Windermere, studded with woods and dwellings, are the nearer beauties.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Walna Scar",41,51],["Coniston",74,82],["Seathwaite",88,98],["Coniston",166,174],["Lancashire",363,373],["Coniston",873,881],["Crag",1171,1175],["Dow Crag",1319,1327],["Old Man",1336,1343],["Old Man",1901,1908],["Devoke Water",2906,2918],["Furness",3074,3081],["Italy",3101,3106],["Isle",3157,3161],["Ingleborough",3274,3286],["Lancaster Castle",3320,3336],["Snowdon",3377,3384],["Low Water",3467,3476],["Seathwaite Tarn",3501,3516],["Duddon",3536,3542],["Stickle Tarn",3551,3563],["Lowes Water",3661,3672],["Coniston",3830,3838],["Windermere",3843,3853]],"geonouns":[["road",52,56],["moor",208,212],["country",316,323],["ridges",353,359],["promontories",544,556],["moor",615,619],["ground",797,803],["moor",824,828],["towers",891,897],["tracks",983,989],["paths",1032,1037],["house",1074,1079],["fields",1118,1124],["precipice",1141,1150],["mountain",1271,1279],["top",1292,1295],["tarn",1368,1372],["precipice",1390,1399],["rock",1507,1511],["crags",1550,1555],["summit",1757,1763],["edge",1771,1775],["line",1781,1785],["rocks",1789,1794],["sea",1866,1869],["summit",1887,1893],["rock",1927,1931],["mountain",2153,2161],["country",2237,2244],["quarries",2334,2342],["mountain",2585,2593],["hills",2728,2733],["mountain",2817,2825],["line",2925,2929],["lake",2995,2999],["sea",3135,3138],["mountains",3247,3256],["mountain",3622,3630],["lakes",3690,3695],["sea",3741,3744],["estuaries",3760,3769],["coast",3784,3789],["shores",3820,3826],["woods",3868,3873]],"pos_words":[["best",14,18],["leads",63,68],["bright",132,138],["prosperous",143,153],["exhilaration",244,256],["perfect",562,569],["right",1243,1248],["best",1303,1307],["great",1658,1663],["convenience",2041,2052],["welcome",2089,2096],["overtaken",2123,2132],["fine",2189,2193],["important",2278,2287],["works",2411,2416],["works",2542,2547],["best",3008,3012],["comfortable",3052,3063],["good",3185,3189],["clear",3362,3367],["remarkable",3421,3431],["glorious",3721,3729],["beautiful",3795,3804]],"neg_words":[["lies",288,292],["dark",539,543],["wild",819,823],["desolate",1094,1102],["steep",1265,1270],["dark",1352,1356],["solemn",1361,1367],["lies",1373,1377],["lies",1438,1442],["precipitous",1515,1526],["grotesque",1569,1578],["inferior",2029,2037],["bad",2136,2139],["unusual",2476,2483],["conspicuous",3170,3181],["lies",3496,3500],["issues",3543,3549],["conspicuous",3567,3578],["lying",3580,3585],["hollow",3608,3614],["lies",3656,3660]],"events":[["Round",1464,1469]],"dates":[["month",2506,2511],["a fine",3117,3123]],"times":[["the morning",501,512]],"distances":[["2,000 feet",1845,1855],["half a-mile",2566,2577]],"loc_advs":[["left",123,127],["behind",175,181],["here",409,413],["there",418,423],["here",630,634],["there",638,643],["there",834,839],["beneath",1378,1385],["there",2395,2400],["here",2417,2421],["there",2617,2622],["abroad",2845,2851],["there",3710,3715]],"spa_preps":[["into",83,87],["into",335,339],["out",725,728],["along",1001,1006],["among",1103,1108],["above",1421,1426],["below",1457,1462],["against",1686,1693],["above",1856,1861],["away",2523,2527],["about",2560,2565],["among",2718,2723],["within",3406,3412],["under",3586,3591]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0054495913,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986826777},{"para_id":219,"paragraph":"The finest descent, though the longest, is by the ridge of Wetherlam, above Levers Water, descending into Tilberthwaite, and returning to Coniston through Yewdale, noticed at p. 27.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Wetherlam",59,68],["Levers Water",76,88],["Tilberthwaite",106,119],["Coniston",138,146],["Yewdale",155,162]],"geonouns":[["ridge",50,55]],"pos_words":[["finest",4,10]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["27",178,180]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["above",70,75],["into",101,105],["through",147,154]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0625,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9982795715},{"para_id":220,"paragraph":"Vii.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.8207454085},{"para_id":221,"paragraph":"Hawes Water. -- Pass Of Nanbield.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Hawes Water",0,11]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9897146821},{"para_id":222,"paragraph":"Miles.

Penrith is a neat little town, busy, from being the great thoroughfare of the district, but not particularly interesting, except from some Druidical remains in the neighbourhood, a curiosity in the churchyard, and the vicinity of Brougham Castle. The circle called Long Meg and her daughters is six miles from Penrith; and no relic of the kind in England is better worth a visit. In the churchyard of Penrith is the monument about which nobody really knows any thing, though it goes by the name of the Giant's Grave.

It is little more than three miles long, and about half a-mile broad. One side is richly wooded; the other nearly bare: and a pair of bold promontories threaten to cut it in two, in one part, where the passage is only two or three hundred yards wide. Round the head of the lake cluster the great mountains of Harter Fell, High Street, Kidsty Pike and others, leaving space among the skirts for the exquisite little valley of Mardale. Those who are able to obtain one of Lord Lonsdale's boats for the traverse of the lake may think themselves fortunate; for this is, of course, the most prefect way of seeing the surroundings of so small a sheet of water: and all other persons are deprived, by prohibition, of the means of doing so. There are some good houses on the shores and at the further end; but the occupants who live on the very brink are not allowed to keep any sort of boat. His lordship's boats are said to be procurable for the asking; but the preliminaries are a hindrance. The walk along the lake side is, how - ever, easy and agreeable enough. The road skirts the western bank. The crags which are sprinkled or heaped about the head of the lake are very fine. They jut out from the mountain side, or stand alone on the green slopes, or collect into miniature mountain clusters, which shelter tiny dells, whence the sheep send forth their bleat. There is a white house conspicuous at the head of the lake which is not the inn, however the tired traveller may wish it were. The inn at Mardale Green is a full mile from the water; and sweet is the passage to it, if the walker be not too weary. The path winds through the levels, round the bases of the knolls, past the ruins of the old church, and among snug little farms, while, at one end of the dale is the lake, and the other is closed in by the passes to Kentmere and Sleddale; and the great Pikes tower on either hand. The stream which gushes here and pauses there, as it passes among rough stones or through a green meadow, comes down from Small Water, reinforced by a brook from Blea Water on High Street, which joins the other a little above Mardale.","file_id":"1855_a","plnames":[["Hawes Water",0,11],["Askham",39,45],["Harter Fell",356,367],["High Street",369,380],["Kidsty Pike",382,393],["Mardale",472,479],["Mardale Green",1545,1558],["Kentmere",1870,1878],["Pikes",1907,1912],["Small Water",2057,2068],["Blea Water",2097,2107],["High Street",2111,2122],["Mardale",2161,2168]],"geonouns":[["promontories",186,198],["head",308,312],["lake",320,324],["mountains",343,352],["valley",462,468],["boats",533,538],["lake",563,567],["water",695,700],["houses",800,806],["shores",814,820],["boat",926,930],["boats",947,952],["lake",1053,1057],["road",1110,1114],["bank",1134,1138],["crags",1144,1149],["head",1190,1194],["lake",1202,1206],["mountain",1244,1252],["slopes",1287,1293],["mountain",1321,1329],["dells",1359,1364],["house",1424,1429],["head",1449,1453],["lake",1461,1465],["inn",1483,1486],["inn",1538,1541],["water",1583,1588],["path",1658,1662],["church",1746,1752],["farms",1776,1781],["dale",1808,1812],["lake",1820,1824],["passes",1860,1866],["tower",1913,1918],["stream",1939,1945],["passes",1988,1994],["stones",2007,2013],["meadow",2033,2039],["brook",2086,2091]],"pos_words":[["richly",129,135],["great",337,342],["exquisite",445,454],["fortunate",589,598],["good",795,799],["easy",1079,1083],["agreeable",1088,1097],["enough",1098,1104],["fine",1216,1220],["sweet",1594,1599],["great",1901,1906]],"neg_words":[["lies",12,16],["threaten",199,207],["deprived",728,736],["hindrance",1023,1032],["conspicuous",1430,1441],["tired",1500,1505],["weary",1647,1652],["ruins",1729,1734],["rough",2001,2006]],"events":[["Round",298,303]],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["about four miles",17,33],["more than three miles",60,81],["half a-mile",98,109],["a full mile",1562,1573]],"loc_advs":[["past",1720,1724],["here",1959,1963],["there",1975,1980]],"spa_preps":[["about",92,97],["among",420,425],["along",1043,1048],["about",1180,1185],["out",1231,1234],["into",1306,1310],["through",1669,1676],["round",1689,1694],["among",1758,1763],["among",1995,2000],["through",2017,2024],["down",2047,2051],["above",2155,2160]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0098522167,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9952228665},{"para_id":229,"paragraph":"The hostess at Mardale Green Inn will make her guests comfortable with homely food and a clean bed: and the host will, if necessary, act as guide up the passes.
