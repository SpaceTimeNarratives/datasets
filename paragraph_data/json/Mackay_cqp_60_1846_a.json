The district, it is true, is not particularly rich in historical incidents;-- it has been the scene of no great events;-- it is a remote corner, lying out of the way of public turmoil, but what it wants in history it more than makes up in poetry; and if its ancient glories are almost a blank, it has modern ones, which make it classic ground. The author has not endeavoured to supersede the ordinary guide-books; he hopes, however, that it will be found an adjunct, not altogether useless, to the one which has been published under the direct superin tendence of the great poet, who has resided for the whole of his lengthened life among the scenery of the Lakes, or any other which the Tourist may prefer. As in\" The Thames and its Tributaries\" the Author has undertaken to dwell upon romantic and remarkable events,\" in the very spots where they occurred, to jog his reader's memory, and to act the part of a gossiping, not a prosy fellow-traveller,\" making it apparent that, wherever he went,\" he could not but remember,\" and that he never passed unheeding over any ground\" that had been dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue,\" or had charms for the lover of nature.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Great Britain",199,212],["Lakes",1032,1037],["Thames",1093,1099]],"geonouns":[["district",95,103],["district",378,386],["ground",710,716],["ground",1444,1450]],"pos_words":[["work",28,32],["romantic",51,59],["celebrated",128,138],["beautiful",186,195],["admiration",263,273],["loveliness",322,332],["rich",420,424],["great",480,485],["modern",675,681],["classic",702,709],["great",942,947],["prefer",1074,1080],["romantic",1161,1169],["remarkable",1174,1184],["dignified",1466,1475],["wisdom",1479,1485],["bravery",1487,1494],["virtue",1499,1505],["lover",1530,1535]],"neg_words":[["object",4,10],["lying",519,524],["turmoil",550,557],["useless",856,863]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["among",113,118],["out",525,528],["under",901,906],["among",1007,1012],["over",1435,1439]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1145038168,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981150627},{"para_id":5,"paragraph":"The Author cannot conclude, without expressing his obligations to the Artists who have contributed to make this volume so attractive by its pictorial embellishments.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["attractive",122,132]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",28,35]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0833333333,"vader_sentiment":0.58,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987290502},{"para_id":6,"paragraph":"Contents","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.7931984067},{"para_id":7,"paragraph":"Chapter I.

Its castle, built by Roger de Poitou in the eleventh century, and repaired by John of Gaunt in the fourteenth, has disappeared, and a range of uniform new buildings, still called the Castle, and occupied as Courts of Law, stands upon its site. From the terrace walk around, there is a fine view of the valley of the Lune, the Bay of Morecambe, Lancaster Sands, and, in the distance, the hills of Westmorland, whose bold outlines against the sky of a clear evening inspire the mind of the tourist, whose object it is to explore them, with pleasing ideas of the magnificence and beauty that are to be exhibited to his gaze as soon as he has crossed the flat country that intervenes. The name of the town of Lancaster naturally suggests that of the great man in early English history, who took his title from it-- John of Gaunt: and also recalls the remembrance of the wars of the rival factions of the White and Red Roses which caused the shedding of so much innocent English blood. There are, however, no incidents connected with the town to keep up the enthusiasm of the visitor. There is no story of John of Gaunt, or of his illustrious friend Chaucer, in connection with it; and the wars of the Roses would not have been celebrated in so much poetry and romance if there were no reminiscences attached to them, but such as the town of Lancaster can supply. The place however, as a modern town, is not without attraction; and the view from the bridge on the road to Kendal-- with the modern castle and the fine church, both rising upon the hill that overlooks the town and district, is comfortably and thoroughly English in its character.

At this meeting not only Sir Walter Scott and Professor Wilson, but George Canning and William Wordsworth were present. \" There was,\" says Mr. Lockhart,\" high discourse intermingled with as gay feastings of courtly with as ever Canning displayed, and a plentiful allowance on all sides of those airy transient pleasantries, in which the fancy of poets, however wise and grave, delights to run riot, when they are sure not to be misunderstood. The weather was as Elysian as the scenery. There were brilliant cavalcades through the woods in the mornings, and delicious boatings on the Lake by moonlight; and the last day the Admiral of the lake presided over one of the most splendid regattas that ever enlivened Windermere.

From the road the views that are obtained of it are pleasing, but not to be compared to the prospect from a summer-house in Mr. Wordsworth's garden, which I afterwards heard of and visited, and to the glimpses which are to be obtained from some of the mountain paths, unknown to the majority of travellers. Mr. Wordsworth states that a foot-road passing behind Rydal Mount and under Nab Scar to Grasmere is very favourable to views of the lake and the vale, looking back towards Ambleside. He also says that the horseroad along the western side of the lake, under Loughrigg Fell, exhibits beauties in this small mere of which the traveller who keeps the high road is not at all aware. Upon this occasion, not having the advantage of a hint from any person as to the proper route to be pursued, I kept the highway; and certainly had no reason to regret doing so, for a lovelier or more agreeable walk I never took. A little island in the lake covered with trees, seemed the very abode of Mab or Titania;-- the waters were placid as a sleeping child; and the green fringe of woodland upon its shores and the high bank of mountains in which it was enclosed on either side seemed steeped in the luxury and glory of sunshine, and happy in the peacefulness of that lovely summer's day. The whole country seemed worthy of being chosen as the abiding place of poets, and I meditated as I walked upon the strange concatenation of circumstances that had been the means of fixing the name of the' Lake poets,' upon the writers who either dwell now or formerly resided in the immediate neighbourhood. These writers, so distinct in their characteristics-- so totally opposite in many respects in their poetical genius, were all classed together by unthinking critics; and formed into a school by others, when they had not the remotest intention of forming a school for themselves. First there was Wordsworth, meditative, passionless, equable, and sometimes elegant:-- but very often tame;-- then Coleridge exquisitely elegant-- deeply meditative, and full of passion and power and music; singing a song of loftier impulses-- but singing too little, and making every one who has hung upon his inspired accents regret that he had not wholly devoted the powers of his mind to that poetry in which he took so great a delight himself, and in which the world would have taken still greater. Then, again, there was Southey, different from both-- with a wealth of imagination to which Wordsworth has little claim, with an oriental splendour and fulness, and a command of language and rhytmn rarely equalled; but failing in that tenderness and power to touch the heart which so charm us in Coleridge. Lastly, there was Wilson differing from them all; and a greater poet in his prose than in his rhyme-- but forming the link by which the names of the other three were attached to the public remembrance, more powerfully than by any other, out of themselves. It is certainly strange enough that these writers shoulder be held even now to have formed a school of poetry. Coleridge, who confesses that he was rightfully charged by the critics with a profusion of double epithets and a general turgidness of style, wonders that for at least seventeen years the same critics obstinately placed him among the Lake poets, and charged him like them, or rather like Wordsworth, with faults of the very opposite character, viz, bald and prosaic language and an affected simplicity both of manner and matter:-- faults, which, as he says, assuredly did not enter into the character of his literary compositions. Southey was equally at a loss to account for his classification in this school. He was in Portugal, having just published Thalaba, when, as he informs us in the preface to the fourth volume of his collected works published in 1837,\" his name was first coupled with Mr. Wordsworth's. \" We were then,\" he adds,\" and for some time afterwards all but strangers to each other, and certainly there were no two poets in whose productions, the difference not being that between good and bad, less resemblance could be found. But I happened to residing at Keswick, when Mr. Wordsworth and I began to be acquainted; Mr. Coleridge also had resided there; and this was reason enough for classing us together as a school of poets. Accordingly for more than twenty years from that time every tyro in criticism who could smatter and sneer, tried his' prentice hand' upon the Lake poets, and every young sportsman who carried a pop-gun in the field of satire considered them fair game.\" Yet, when we come to reflect upon the subject, we find, notwithstanding this protest on the part of two of the illustrious trio, that there are points of similtude between their works and that although they differ in their most obvious characteristics, they bear a strong resemblance in one-- and that a most essential one. Each of the three was of the romantic-- or more properly speaking-- of the natural school, as opposed to the classic; and in this particular, each rendered no small service to literature and poetry. The world had had too much of super-refinement;-- too much of mannerism;-- too much of mere copying of antique models-- when, all at once, these writers appeared, and following up what Cowper had begun-- performed for English poetry what Burns had done for that of Scotland. They went back to nature, and took her for a model instead of convention. They restored the ancient simplicity. Wordsworth, more especially, excited for poetry, what has lately been excited for religion in another part of the country,-- a revival;-- the effects of which are still to be traced, and will doubtless be traced for a long time yet to come in the literatue of the country.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Rydal Water",0,11],["Lakes",42,47],["Wordsworth",214,224],["Wordsworth",397,407],["Rydal Mount",447,458],["Nab Scar",469,477],["Grasmere",481,489],["Ambleside",565,574],["Loughrigg Fell",650,664],["Wordsworth",1970,1980],["Wordsworth",2550,2560],["Wordsworth",3420,3430],["Wordsworth",3932,3942],["Keswick",4210,4217],["Wordsworth",4228,4238],["Scotland",5422,5430],["Wordsworth",5544,5554]],"geonouns":[["road",95,99],["house",201,206],["mountain",338,346],["paths",347,352],["foot",422,426],["road",427,431],["lake",525,529],["vale",538,542],["lake",638,642],["mere",698,702],["road",745,749],["island",1009,1015],["lake",1023,1027],["trees",1041,1046],["waters",1095,1101],["shores",1177,1183],["bank",1197,1201],["mountains",1205,1214],["country",1376,1383],["school",1859,1865],["school",1931,1937],["school",3114,3120],["school",3735,3741],["school",4364,4370],["field",4590,4595],["points",4778,4784],["school",5041,5047],["mere",5244,5248],["country",5808,5815]],"pos_words":[["beautiful",75,84],["pleasing",138,146],["advantage",806,815],["proper",852,858],["agreeable",971,980],["luxury",1277,1283],["glory",1288,1293],["happy",1311,1316],["lovely",1345,1351],["worthy",1391,1397],["genius",1784,1790],["exquisitely",2079,2090],["passion",2132,2139],["great",2378,2383],["delight",2386,2393],["charm",2742,2747],["powerfully",2972,2982],["enough",3045,3051],["rightfully",3169,3179],["profusion",3210,3219],["wonders",3274,3281],["like",3394,3398],["like",3415,3419],["assuredly",3590,3599],["works",3870,3875],["good",4133,4137],["enough",4327,4333],["fair",4622,4626],["illustrious",4745,4756],["works",4812,4817],["strong",4899,4905],["properly",5006,5014],["classic",5067,5074],["super",5187,5192],["restored",5511,5519],["excited",5573,5580],["excited",5614,5621],["doubtless",5736,5745]],"neg_words":[["unknown",354,361],["regret",931,937],["strange",1482,1489],["critics",1832,1839],["hung",2251,2255],["regret",2282,2288],["failing",2677,2684],["tenderness",2693,2703],["strange",3037,3044],["critics",3195,3202],["critics",3325,3332],["obstinately",3333,3344],["faults",3437,3443],["faults",3563,3569],["loss",3688,3692],["bad",4142,4145],["criticism",4449,4458],["sneer",4481,4486],["protest",4711,4718]],"events":[],"dates":[["a summer",192,200],["summer",1352,1358],["day",1361,1364],["at least seventeen years",3291,3315],["1837",3889,3893],["more than twenty years",4397,4419]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["behind",440,446],["opposite",1740,1748],["there",1960,1965],["there",2471,2476],["there",2773,2778],["there",4049,4054],["there",4300,4305],["there",4768,4773]],"spa_preps":[["under",463,468],["along",608,613],["under",644,649],["together",1809,1817],["into",1852,1856],["out",3002,3005],["among",3356,3361],["opposite",3456,3464],["into",3614,3618],["between",4125,4132],["together",4350,4358],["between",4798,4805]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0379241517,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977351427},{"para_id":69,"paragraph":"In the midst of thoughts something like these, I arrived at Grasmere, with its green and solitary but beautiful island in the middle; and began to conjure up recollections of a certain Wishing Gate, which poets had sung of.

St. Oswald's day is on the Sunday nearest to the first of August, and upon this day the rush-bearing, as I am informed, annually takes place in Grasmere, and I believe in Ambleside and other places. Anciently, when the floors of the churches in England were neither paved nor boarded, rushes were indispensable articles of comfort to churchgoing people; but with the progress of elegance in architecture, it became rare to find unpaved churches, and the ceremony of strewing the rushes fell consequently into disuse. A correspondent of Mr. Hone, in the Year Book, under date of the 27th of April, 1831, states that the sweet-scented flag, or acorus calamus, was commonly made use of on these occasions, having been selected originally in consequence of their roots giving out, when bruised by the tread of feet, a very powerful and fragrant odour, resembling that of the myrtle. This plant, however, from its great demand in breweries, under the name of quassia, has not been obtainable for many years, and the yellow water iris has been substituted in its place. The rush-bearing at Grasmere generally takes place in the evening, when the children of the village, chiefly girls, parade through the street to the church, preceded by a band of music, bearing garlands of wild flowers, as well as bundles of rushes; the latter of which they deposit on the altar, or strew about the floor of the church. Full accounts of the ceremony, as observed in various parts of the North of England, will be found in Hone's interesting volumes, and in Brande's popular antiquities of England.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Grasmere",14,22],["Lancashire",246,256],["Yorkshire",258,267],["Westmoreland",269,281],["Cumberland",287,297],["Grasmere",466,474],["Ambleside",493,502],["England",567,574],["Grasmere",1406,1414],["England",1799,1806],["England",1892,1899]],"geonouns":[["church",4,10],["churches",555,563],["churches",758,766],["feet",1128,1132],["water",1340,1345],["village",1478,1485],["street",1521,1527],["church",1535,1541],["church",1715,1721]],"pos_words":[["dedicated",26,35],["celebrated",69,79],["beauty",98,104],["celebration",164,175],["comfort",645,652],["progress",689,697],["elegance",701,709],["sweet",941,946],["powerful",1141,1149],["fragrant",1154,1162],["great",1231,1236],["obtainable",1298,1308],["well",1609,1613],["interesting",1832,1843],["popular",1869,1876]],"neg_words":[["fell",808,812],["bruised",1104,1111],["wild",1592,1596]],"events":[["the Year Book",871,884]],"dates":[["annual",157,163],["day",335,338],["Sunday",349,355],["the first of August",367,386],["this day",397,405],["annually",442,450],["April",912,917],["many years",1313,1323]],"times":[["the evening",1440,1451]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",826,830],["under",886,891],["out",1094,1097],["under",1258,1263],["through",1509,1516],["about",1692,1697]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0740740741,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985559583},{"para_id":81,"paragraph":"On my return to Ambleside, I found sooner than I had calculated upon, the expected note of Mr. Wordsworth awaiting me.

It is no part of the plan of this little book to record the conversation of Mr. Wordsworth during the two hours that I had the pleasure and advantage of his society. Interesting as the record might be, and often as the bad example has been set of repeating conversations never meant to be repeated, and of perpetuating in print the unstudied expressions of confidential intercourse, the practice is unwarrantable. When a great man has departed from amongst us; when there is no longer the possibility of hearing his voice in his own familiar haunts; and when every reminiscence, however trifling, becomes of values, these records of conversations are like so many treasures recovered from the yawning depths of oblivion; but in the lifetime of a great man, publication is an offence against him, and against society. If he have been informed that his words are to be taken down; and that he is speaking to the public through the medium of his interlocutor, the case is different; but as neither Mr. Wordsworth nor myself had any such notion, our long conversation upon poets, poetry, criticism, hill-climbing, autograph-hunting, and various other matters, must remain untold. An exception in the case of one portion of our talk may, however, be made with advantage, as it does honour to the illustrious dead; and is a topic of much interest to all students and to all the drudges of literature. In speaking of the lamented Southey, whose name is so intimately associated with his own, and whose friendship and society he enjoyed for so many years, he dwelt with much emphasis upon the long-continued and systematic economy of his time, by which he was enabled to vary his studies from history to philosophy-- from philosophy to politics-- from politics to poetry, and do more work in each then would have sufficed to make the reputation of half a dozen men of inferior attainments. At the period of his death, and indeed long before, it was the general opinion that he had tasked his brain too severely by study; that his intellect had become overclouded from excess of mental toil; and that he had laboured\" not wisely, but too well.\" Mr. Wordsworth, however, upon my putting the question to him, denied that such was the case. Though Southey's labours were almost superhuman, and were varied in a wonderful manner, they seemed, he said, rather to refresh and strengthen, than to weary and weaken his mind. He fell a victim, not to literary toil, but to his strong affection for his first wife, which led him night after night, when his labours of the day were ended, to watch with sleepless anxiety over her sick bed. The strongest mind, as he observed, will ultimately give way under the long-continued deprivation of the natural refreshmen of the body. No brain can remain in permanent health that has been overtasked by nightly vigils, still more than by daily labour. When such vigils are accompanied by the perpetually-recurring pain of beholding the sufferings of a beloved object, and the as perpetually-recurring fear of losing it, they became doubly and trebly injurious; and the labour that must be done, becomes no longer the joy and the solace that it used to be. It is transformed from a pleasure into a pain; from a friend into an enemy; from a companion into a fearful monster; crying, like the daughter of the horseleech,\" Give!-- give!\" It is then that the fine and delicate machinery of the mind is deranged. It is then that it snaps; then that thee\" sweet bells are jangled and out of tune\"-- that the light is extinguished, and the glory hidden under a cloud, that Eternity may lift, but not Time. Such, it appears, was the case with the amiable Robert Southey; the grand if not the great poet; the accomplished scholar and the estimable man in every relation of life. So was it, also, in the more recent fate of the equally amiable and estimable Laman Blanchard, whose sad story I recalled to Mr. Wordsworth's recollection, as a parallel case. To the free mind, untouched by domestic grief, literary toil, however great, is scarcely a burden; but when one engrossing sorrow comes, and the brain must work in spite of it, the conflict begins, in which sorrow not only gains the mastery, but destroys the battle field, and blasts its fruit in this life, for ever.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Windermere",12,22],["Rydal",116,121],["Windermere",154,164],["Loughrigg",180,189],["Wordsworth",352,362],["Wordsworth",1271,1281],["Wordsworth",2412,2422],["Wordsworth",4192,4202]],"geonouns":[["door",32,36],["grounds",95,102],["water",122,127],["hills",220,225],["landscape",243,252],["hill",1367,1371],["bed",2887,2890],["field",4505,4510]],"pos_words":[["finest",45,51],["beauty",264,270],["pleasure",399,407],["advantage",412,421],["great",693,698],["like",923,927],["great",1018,1023],["advantage",1527,1536],["illustrious",1563,1574],["enjoyed",1793,1800],["work",2048,2052],["sufficed",2077,2085],["reputation",2098,2108],["wisely",2385,2391],["well",2401,2405],["wonderful",2571,2580],["refresh",2621,2628],["strong",2731,2737],["affection",2738,2747],["led",2774,2777],["strongest",2896,2905],["beloved",3246,3253],["joy",3411,3414],["solace",3423,3429],["pleasure",3475,3483],["like",3575,3579],["fine",3648,3652],["delicate",3657,3665],["sweet",3743,3748],["glory",3826,3831],["amiable",3932,3939],["grand",3960,3965],["great",3977,3982],["accomplished",3993,4005],["amiable",4119,4126],["free",4246,4250],["great",4309,4314],["engrossing",4351,4361],["work",4395,4399],["gains",4462,4467],["mastery",4472,4479]],"neg_words":[["bad",491,494],["offence",1047,1054],["criticism",1356,1365],["dead",1575,1579],["inferior",2132,2140],["death",2175,2180],["toil",2349,2353],["denied",2470,2476],["weary",2653,2658],["weaken",2663,2669],["fell",2683,2687],["toil",2714,2718],["anxiety",2865,2872],["sick",2882,2886],["pain",3208,3212],["object",3254,3260],["fear",3295,3299],["losing",3303,3309],["injurious",3344,3353],["pain",3491,3495],["enemy",3519,3524],["fearful",3550,3557],["monster",3558,3565],["cloud",3847,3852],["sad",4164,4167],["untouched",4257,4266],["grief",4279,4284],["toil",4295,4299],["scarcely",4319,4327],["burden",4330,4336],["sorrow",4362,4368],["spite",4403,4408],["conflict",4420,4428],["sorrow",4446,4452]],"events":[],"dates":[["so many years",1805,1818],["the day",2821,2828],["nightly",3097,3104],["daily",3132,3137]],"times":[["the two hours",370,383],["night",2782,2787],["night",2794,2799]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",738,743]],"spa_preps":[["amid",200,204],["amongst",721,728],["against",1055,1062],["against",1072,1079],["down",1145,1149],["through",1189,1196],["over",2873,2877],["under",2953,2958],["into",3484,3488],["into",3511,3515],["into",3543,3547],["out",3771,3774],["under",3839,3844]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0179948586,"vader_sentiment":-0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9191465974},{"para_id":99,"paragraph":"Before leaving Mr. Wordsworth's garden I made the acquaintance of Mr. John Mills, of Ashton Under-Lyne, a young enthusiast in literature, who, like myself, had come to pay his respects to the bard. He was afterwards my companion for three days amid the lakes, and explored their beauties with me. We viewed and admired together the unrivalled landscape which is to be seen from the summer-house in Mr. Wordsworth's garden commanding Windermere in almost its whole extent on the one side, and Rydal Water and Grasmere on the other, and returned together to Ambleside. Congeniality of taste having made us intimate in less than a quarter of an hour, we formed, as we went, the intention of taking a boat upon Windermere, as the weather still continued propitious, and devoting the remainder of the day to an exploration of the scenery of the lake. To Water Head-- which may be called the port of Ambleside, is a walk of about three quarters of a mile, and it struck us both, beautifully situated as the town is, that it would have been much better if it had been placed on the edge of the lake, instead of at a distance so considerable. On arriving we saw the little steam-boat,\" the Lady of the Lake,\" that has lately been introduced upon this quiet mere, ploughing its way towards Bowness, which made us regret that we had not been in time to avail ourselves of its more rapid conveyance. Remembering Mr. Wordsworth's printed denunciations of steam, and the opposition that this elegant little boat had encountered on its first introduction, we were led to make enquiries about it, and learned that it was very ill-supported. Tourists, to whom it is a great convenience, had no prejudice against it, but the very reverse; and by them, during the season, it was well patronised. The inhabitants, however, of Bowness, Lowood, Ambleside, and generally the gentry of the neighbourhood, set their faces against it, and would not use it, we were informed, even for the conveyance of a parcel-- so annoyed were they that their darling lake should be disturbed by the evolutions of the paddle, or their clear atmosphere contaminated by the smoke of a funnel. It seemed sheer pride and aristocratic feeling that was at the bottom of this ill-will; for the boatmen, as far as we could learn, did not regard it with any particular jealousy. On Loch Katrine, on the contrary, the introduction of a steam-boat two years before, had excited so much animosity on the part of the Highland reivers, who, in the shape of boatmen and pony-hirers, prey most unmercifully upon the pockets of the traveller, that they made a vow to sink it-- and kept their word.

Here we found every smooth surface afforded by the rocks-- every slab on the stratified formation,-- covered with inscriptions, engraved with much toil, in letters varying from six to twenty or twenty - four inches in height. On one large red stone of at least ten feet square, was engraved\" 1833: Money. Liberty. Wealth. Peace\";-- a catalogue of blessings very much to be desired. On another stone was the simple date\" 1688:\" expressive enough of the engraver's political sentiments.-- And on another in larger characters,\" A Slave Landing On The British Strand, Becomes Free.\" All the largest stones, and slabs, some of which were horizontal, others vertical, and the rest inclined at various angles, and the whole of them giving evidence that the place had formerly been a quarry-- were covered with inscriptions of a like purport. The following are a few of the most striking. One immense surface of rock bore the following names, which are transcribed in the original order. \" Sun. Bulwer. Dryden. Davy. Burns. Scott. Burdett. Garrick. Kemble. Gray. Kean. Milton. Henry Brougham. James Watt. Professor Wilson. Dr. Jenner.\" To which were added the words in characters equally conspicuous,\" The Liberty Of The Press.\" \" Magna Charta.\" This slab was a testimony apparently, of the engraver's admiration of great intellect.

He took great pleasure in the task and was, as the boatman took pains to impress upon us, rather\" dull\" at the time. This phrase as he afterwards explained, implies, in this part of the country, that he was deranged; and I thought when looking with renewed interest upon these mementos of his ingenuity and perseverance, missapplied though they were, that it was a happy circumstance that an afflicted creature could have found solace under calamity, in a manner so harmless. There was a method in the work, and a sense, too, in the poor man's ideas, which showed that his sympathies were in favour of the moral and intellectual advancement of mankind; and that, amid the last feeble glimmerings of his own reason, he could do honour to those whose intellect had benefited and adorned our age.

There are several small islands at the head of the lake between the two places above mentioned; and a sail amongst them on a clear summer day, with a mind free from care, and an imagination watchful for every beauty that may be offered to it, is recompense for a month's toil and trouble to procure it.

There are also char and eels in abundance. The principal feeders of the lake are, Grisedale Beck, formed by the overflow of a tarn high up between Seat Scandal and Helvellyn; and Godrill Beck, formed by a junction of the overflowing waters of Blea and Angle Tarns. Glencoin Beck, formed by the overflow of the Red and Keppel Tarns, also contributes its quota, and a score of nameless streams, dry in summer, but strong and rejoicing in the autumn and winter, pay their tribute to the luent majority of Ulleswater.

My hopes were disappointed; and I was not so enthusiastic in my love for the mountain as to scale its heights amid the clouds of vapour that obscured all surrounding objects; the more especially as my recent experiences in hill climbing had given me but small encouragement for mountain rambles amid mist and rain. I was, therefore, obliged to relinquish the idea, and to give the following account of the mountain, from such sources of information as books afforded me. According to the Ordnance survey, Helvellyn is 3055 feet above the level of the sea; and from its summit extensive views are obtained of the most beautiful portions of the lake district. The ascent is sometimes made from the opposite side at Wythburn, on the road from Ambleside to Keswick, the distance being much less from that point than from other places; but travellers who like the assistance of horses or ponies for the first half of the work, prefer to start from Patterdale. From the latter place, says Mr. Wordsworth, it may be made on horseback with a little management as far as the Red Tarn, by taking the track up Grisedale, through the ancient farm-yard of Grasset How. It then proceeds winding up the side of the hill in the direction of Bleaberry Carg, an offshoot of the shoulder of the mountain called Striding Edge, and then strikes off by the foot of the Red Tarn to the stakes where the horses are usually tied. The remainder of the ascent must be made on foot. The road ascends by Swirrel Edge, a rocky projection of Helvellyn, crowned by a conical hill with the abominable name of Catchedicam; from which point a scramble of twenty minutes will place the traveller on the highest peak of Helvellyn. Some persons, we are informed, are bold enough in making the ascent, to traverse the giddy and dangerous height of Striding Edge, but this road, says the Bard of the Lakes,\" ought not to be taken by any one with weak nerves,\" as the top in many places scarcely affords room to plant the foot, and is beset with awful precipices on either side. The place, he adds, derives a melancholy interest from the fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished in the spring of 1805, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over from Wythburn to Patterdale. His remains were not discovered, as we learn from an introduction to a poem by Sir Walter Scott, until three months afterwards, when they were found guarded by a faithful terrier bitch, his constant attendant during frequent solitary rambles through the wilds of Cumberland and Westmoreland. It appears from the same note that the stranger, whose name was Gough, was a young gentleman of talent, and of a most amiable disposition. Both Sir Walter Scott and Mr. Wordsworth have written poems upon the subject. Sir Walter's is entitled Helvellyn, and is curious to the critic as a specimen of bad verse upon a good subject, by the foremost man in literature of all his time.

On the mountains are two cairns, or piles of stone, called\" men,\" about a quarter of a mile apart; and from an angle in the hill between them, the best view of the country northward is to be obtained. The majestic Skiddaw, with Blencathra, or Saddleback, on its right, are the most prominent features of the landscape. The list and order of the minor hills which are grouped around, I borrow-- with a protest against the villanous bad taste which led to the naming of them,-- from the very excellent guide book, published on the authority of Mr. Wordsworth, to which I have so often had occasion to refer. \" Nearer the eye than Skiddaw and Saddleback, and lying in a hollow of the mountain, is Kepple Cove Tarn, bounded on the south by Swirrell Edge and Catchedicam. Further south, between the projecting masses of Swirrell Edge and Striding Edge, lies the Red Tarn; and, beyond these, nearly the whole of the middle and lower divisions of Ulleswater are seen. On the eastern, or Westmoreland side, of Ulleswater, are Swarth Fell, Birk Fell, and Place Fell; and, over them, looking in a south-easterly direction, may be seen Kidsay Pike, High Street, and Hill Bell; and still further south, and far distant from the eye, the broad top of Ingleborough is visible. Angle Tarn is seen reposing among the hills beyond Patterdale. On the Cumberland side, beyond Penrith, the ridge of Cross Fell is stretched out. Looking south, having on the left St. Sunday's crag, are Scandale Fell, Fairfield, and Dolly Wagon Pike. Over these summits appear the lakes of Windermere, Coniston, and Esthwaite, with the flat country extending southwards to Lancaster. To the right of Dolly Wagon Pike is Seat Sandal, with a patch of Loughrigg Fell between them. Beyond may be descried the mountains of Coniston, with Black Comb in the distance. Langdale Pikes and Wrynose are seen beyond Steel Fell; and more to the right over Wythburn head, Scawfell and the Pikes look down in majesty over their more humble neighbours. Great End and Lingmel Crag project from the vast mass of mountains, amongst which the Pikes on Scawfell stand unrivalled; and nearer to the eye are the Borrodale Mountains; Glaramara and Rosthwaite Cam being the most conspicuous. Great Gable rears his head on the right of the Pikes; and more to the north is Kirkfell, over which, on a clear day, the Isle of Man may be seen. Next succeeds the great cluster of mountains extending from Derwentwater to Ennerdale. The first range beyond the heights of Wythburn are Gate Crag, Maiden Moor, and Cat Bells, all near Derwentwater; and over these are Dale Head and Robinson. On the confines of Buttermere are seen Honister Crag, Fleetwith, Haycocks, High Crag, High Stile, and Red Pike; and still more remote, the Ennerdale Haycocks. Whitelees Pike, Grassmere, Cawsey Pike, and Grisedale Pike, all lie between the above range and the lake of Bassenthwaite, a great part of which may be observed from Helvellyn; and beyond Bassenthwaite extend the distant plains of Cumberland, and the summits of the Scottish mountains.\" So far our guide book, which we close with an emphatic wish that we may never again have to run over, at one heat, such a cluster of jaw-breaking appellations.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Helvellyn",14,23],["Skiddaw",354,361],["Blencathra",368,378],["Saddleback",383,393],["Wordsworth",686,696],["Skiddaw",768,775],["Saddleback",780,790],["Cove",841,845],["Striding Edge",973,986],["Red Tarn",997,1005],["Ulleswater",1080,1090],["Westmoreland",1120,1132],["Ulleswater",1142,1152],["Swarth Fell",1158,1169],["Birk Fell",1171,1180],["Place Fell",1186,1196],["Pike",1272,1276],["High Street",1278,1289],["Bell",1300,1304],["Ingleborough",1378,1390],["Angle Tarn",1403,1413],["Patterdale",1454,1464],["Cumberland",1473,1483],["Penrith,",1497,1505],["Cross Fell",1519,1529],["Fairfield",1620,1629],["Pike",1647,1651],["Windermere",1692,1702],["Coniston",1704,1712],["Esthwaite",1718,1727],["Lancaster",1775,1784],["Pike",1814,1818],["Seat Sandal",1822,1833],["Loughrigg Fell",1851,1865],["Coniston",1920,1928],["Black Comb",1935,1945],["Langdale Pikes",1963,1977],["Wrynose",1982,1989],["Steel Fell",2006,2016],["Wythburn",2045,2053],["Scawfell",2060,2068],["Pikes",2077,2082],["Great End",2139,2148],["Lingmel",2153,2160],["Crag",2161,2165],["Pikes",2225,2230],["Scawfell",2234,2242],["Borrodale",2291,2300],["Glaramara",2312,2321],["Rosthwaite Cam",2326,2340],["Great Gable",2369,2380],["Pikes",2416,2421],["Kirkfell",2448,2456],["Isle",2490,2494],["Derwentwater",2575,2587],["Ennerdale",2591,2600],["Wythburn",2640,2648],["Crag",2658,2662],["Cat Bells",2681,2690],["Derwentwater",2701,2713],["Buttermere",2777,2787],["Honister Crag",2797,2810],["Fleetwith",2812,2821],["High Crag",2833,2842],["High Stile",2844,2854],["Red Pike",2860,2868],["Ennerdale",2897,2906],["Whitelees",2917,2926],["Pike",2927,2931],["Grassmere",2933,2942],["Pike",2951,2955],["Grisedale Pike",2961,2975],["Bassenthwaite",3025,3038],["Helvellyn",3083,3092],["Bassenthwaite",3105,3118],["Cumberland",3148,3158]],"geonouns":[["summit",4,10],["precipices",116,126],["mountains",147,156],["stone",185,190],["hill",264,268],["country",304,311],["landscape",448,457],["hills",491,496],["mountain",821,829],["top",1371,1374],["hills",1441,1446],["ridge",1510,1515],["crag",1595,1599],["summits",1664,1671],["lakes",1683,1688],["country",1743,1750],["mountains",1907,1916],["head",2054,2058],["mountains",2196,2205],["head",2391,2395],["mountains",2550,2559],["lake",3017,3021],["summits",3168,3175],["mountains",3192,3201]],"pos_words":[["smooth",29,35],["best",287,291],["majestic",345,353],["right",402,407],["prominent",422,431],["led",587,590],["excellent",630,639],["right",1793,1798],["right",2034,2039],["majesty",2096,2103],["humble",2120,2126],["right",2403,2408],["succeeds",2520,2528],["great",2533,2538],["great",3042,3047]],"neg_words":[["abruptly",97,105],["broken",109,115],["protest",541,548],["bad",571,574],["lying",796,801],["hollow",807,813],["lies",988,992],["conspicuous",2356,2367],["lie",2981,2984],["emphatic",3250,3258],["breaking",3341,3349]],"events":[],"dates":[["Sunday",1586,1592],["a clear day",2473,2484]],"times":[["The first",2602,2611]],"distances":[["a quarter of a mile",212,231]],"loc_advs":[["between",269,276],["northward",312,321],["beyond",1490,1496],["left",1577,1581],["beyond",1999,2005]],"spa_preps":[["about",206,211],["apart",232,237],["around",515,521],["against",549,556],["between",922,929],["beyond",1012,1018],["over",1203,1207],["among",1431,1436],["beyond",1447,1453],["out",1543,1546],["between",1866,1873],["over",2040,2044],["down",2088,2092],["over",2104,2108],["amongst",2207,2214],["over",2458,2462],["beyond",2618,2624],["near",2696,2700],["over",2719,2723],["between",2985,2992],["above",2997,3002],["beyond",3098,3104],["close",3236,3241],["over",3300,3304]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0125786164,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9593419433},{"para_id":152,"paragraph":"From the foot of Ulleswater to Penrith is a distance of five miles.

It was here that Fergus told Waverley of his vision of the Bodach Glas. \" Last night,\" said he,\" I felt so feverish that I left my quarters and walked out, in the hope that the keen frosty air would brace my nerves. I crossed a small foot-bridge, and kept walking backwards and forwards, when I observed with surprise, by the clear moonlight, a tall figure in a grey plaid, which, move at what pace I would, kept regularly about four yards before me. I called to him, but received no answer. I felt an anxious throbbing at my heart; and to ascertain what I dreaded, I stood still and turned myself successively on the same spot to the four points of the compass. Turn where I would, the figure was instantly before my eyes at precisely the same distance; I was then convinced it was the Bodach Glas. My hair bristled, and my knees shook. I manned myself, however, and determined to return to my quarters. My ghastly visitant glided before me until he reached the foot-bridge. There he stopped, and turned full round. A desperate courage, founded on the belief that my death was near, made me resolve to force my way in spite of him. I made the sign of the cross, drew my sword, and uttered\" In the name of God, Evil spirit, give place.\" \" Vich Ian Vohr,\" it said, in a voice that made my blood curdle,\" beware of to-morrow.\" It seemed at that moment not half a yard from my sword's point, but the words were no sooner spoken than it was gone, and nothing further appeared to obstruct my passage.\"","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Lowther",16,23],["Penrith,",49,57],["Clifton",81,88],["Arthur's Round Table",133,153],["Clifton",155,162],["Cumberland",260,270],["Eamont",545,551],["Clifton",572,579]],"geonouns":[["road",40,44],["pass",61,65],["village",70,77],["banks",442,447],["stream",453,459],["hamlet",472,478],["foot",815,819],["bridge",820,826],["points",1221,1227],["foot",1544,1548],["bridge",1549,1555],["force",1684,1689],["point",1963,1968]],"pos_words":[["famous",171,177],["keen",758,762],["instantly",1279,1288],["precisely",1307,1316],["courage",1610,1617]],"neg_words":[["feverish",688,696],["anxious",1083,1090],["throbbing",1091,1100],["ghastly",1489,1496],["desperate",1600,1609],["death",1649,1654],["spite",1700,1705],["beware",1884,1890],["obstruct",2056,2064]],"events":[],"dates":[["' 45",291,295],["the clear",903,912],["morrow",1897,1903]],"times":[["Last night",655,665]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",588,592],["left",704,708],["forwards",859,867],["near",1659,1663]],"spa_preps":[["along",25,30],["between",220,227],["between",376,383],["near",465,469],["out",732,735],["about",1004,1009],["round",1591,1596]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0204081633,"vader_sentiment":0.17,"roberta_sentiment":0.997600019},{"para_id":154,"paragraph":"The Round Table is on the Westmoreland side of the Eamont, which here forms the boundary between Westmoreland and Cumberland. It is a circular area, twenty - nine yards in diameter, surrounded by a ditch and elevated mound, with two approaches cut through the mound opposite to each other; and is supposed to have been an area for tournaments, in those long and happily extinguished days of chivalry, when all virtue, all honour, all goodness, were supposed to lie in the breast of him who could make the best( or worst) use of his sword for the slaying of his fellows. A few hundred yards to the west of the Round Table, is an elevation called Mayburgh, upon which is a circular enclosure, one hundred yards in diameter, formed by a broad ridge of rounded stones heaped up to the height of fifteen feet. In the centre of the circle is a pillar of stone eleven feet in height. These relics are undoubtedly of still greater antiquity, and are supposed, on sufficient reason, to have formed part of a Druidical circle. At six miles from Penrith, in a north-eastern direction, there is another Druidical mount of the same kind, but still more distinctly marked, which is known by the name of Long Meg and her daughter. It is to be found on the summit of a hill near little Salkeld. This circle, which is three hundred and fifty yards in circumference is formed by seventy - two stones, placed at irregular intervals. Many of them are ten feet high; and, the one at the entrance, the tallest of the whole, is eighteen feet high. From the Round Table to Brougham Hall, and the ruins of Brougham Castle, is but a short walk.

The latter, which are extensive and in some parts dangerous, are laid two or three feet under water every tide; but when the sea retires, the passage is quite practicable, although the assistance of a guide is not only advisable, but necessary. The view from them is peculiarly grand and striking. Looking southwards we see the point and village of Heysham, with Peel Castle, further away, guarding the entrance of the Bay of Morecambe. Looking to the right hand, are Wharton Crags, already mentioned, Arnside Tower, the ancient residence of the Stanleys, and Silverdale; and, rising in grand confusion, the jagged peaks of the mountains of Westmoreland. As we, however, in our peregrination did not take this route, but proceeded from Ambleside, down Windermere, to Newby Bridge, it is sufficient to mention the fact of its existence; and refer those who may wish to take it to the guide books, for all such particulars as are either essential or interesting. Newby Bridge, at the foot of Windermere, promises but few attractions; and, indeed, this portion of Windermere,-- beautiful as it would be considered were there no upper part of the Lake to monopolize the admiration of the traveller,-- is seldom praised, and perhaps seldom seen. Yet, though there is little at Newby Bridge to detain the traveller, the man who is determined to be pleased, may find opportunity. From the summit of a wooded hill, which overlooks the Inn, there is a most enchanting view of lovely Windermere, surrounded by the lordly mountains of Coniston, Langdale, Loughrigg, Nab Scar, Fairfield, Silverhow, and their magnificent compeers. Between Newby Bridge and Ulverstone, a distance of about eight miles, are the villages of Haverthwaite, East Coulton, Egton, and Newland, none of them in any way remarkable. Ulverstone, however, is a place of some importance. Let any one who wishes to see it to advantage ascend a little hill above it. My companion, in a letter, thus described his impressions,--\" Tired of the dirty drizzle which had been falling ever since I left Ambleside-- tired also of housing myself at Ulverstone, to avoid it, I sauntered listlessly out without any very definite purpose, and mounted the hill. As I reached the summit, the rain ceased, the sun shone out, the clouds dispersed, and what a lovely prospect lay before me. Immediately beneath lay the beautiful old town, which has rather a novel appearance to the stranger from its prevailing red tint, derived from the iron ore for which its neighbourhood is famous. The plain sombre old church-tower, and the slow blue smoke-wreaths' curling up to the sky' combined to give an aspect of serenity, quietude, and gravity to the town, in admirable keeping with the stedfast and somewhat sombre hills which overlook it. To the northward stretched a rich woodland, from which emerged the distant turrets of Conishead Priory, and southwards lay Morecambe Bay with its dazzling expanse of waters. The gleaming monotony of the sea was broken by a few sail of fishing craft, and a little wooded island, where the water begins to narrow to the river's mouth, just beyond Leven Sands. On turning around, a very different scene presented itself. Instead of a flat shining horizon, were piled the black fells,-- the Alps on Alps, in whose neighbourhood I had been spending so many pleasant days,-- huddled in sublime confusion.\" Ulverstone, the modern capital, as it is called, of the district of Furness, to which dignity it has been promoted in the lieu of Dalton, superannuated contains a population of about 5000. Its name is vulgarly pronounced Ooston; by some derived from one Ulphus, who governed in the west parts of Deira or Yorkshire, and who is supposed to have extended his conquest over the whole of the Furness district. It is neat and well-built, and situated on the sides of declivities sloping gently towards the south. A very high antiquity is claimed for it; but, the first mention of it is in 1127, when it was conferred, with the manor attached to it, on the abbey of Furness, by King Stephen, the founder of that monastery. It is situated about a mile and a half from the channel of the Leven, with which it is connected by a canal, constructed in 1795, under the direction of Mr. Rennie. Vessels of 400 tons bur then can navigate it up to the town, and discharge their cargoes on the extensive wharfs surrounding a capacious basin or dock. Its trade, though not of striking amount, is respectable. There are thirty - three vessels belonging to the port, whose aggregate registry is 2136 tons, and the average number of vessels that clear inwards and outwards is 600, with a tonnage of about 30,000. Its chief manufactures are cotton, linen, check, canvass, sacking, and sailcloth, and candlewicks; and its exports besides these are principally the iron and copper ores, and slates of the surrounding district. The church dedicated to St. Mary, stands pleasantly on a hill. It was enlarged and nearly rebuilt in 1804, and consists of a nave, chancel, and aisles. The east window represents the four Evangelists and Christ rising from the sepulchre, after Rubens; and the altar piece is the Taking Down from the Cross, after Sir Joshua Reynolds; both of which were presented by the lay Rector, Mr. Braddyll, of Conishead Priory. The town and neighbourhood abound in striking and beautiful views, and one especially from the back of the old workhouse is universally admired. Swarthmoor Hall and Conishead Priory in the immediate vicinity, both merit the attention of the visitor who is not pressed for time. The first was the residence of the celebrated Judge Fell, the great supporter of George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends, and one of his earliest adherents. After the death of the Judge, his widow married George Fox: but eleven years elapsed between the death of her first husband and her espousal of the second. The Friends have a meeting-house close by, built by George Fox, as testified by an inscription over the door, bearing his initials and the date 1688. There is a road by which the traveller visiting Swarthmoor may proceed to Conishead Priory. The latter with its grounds has obtained from some the title of the\" Paradise of Furness.\" It is a modern and very elegant building erected by Mr. Braddyll on the site of an older mansion, and also of the ancient Priory; and is situated in an extensive and very beautiful park. The pleasure grounds attached, cover about sixteen acres, including a conservatory, a flower-garden and two others called the Old and New American Gardens; and there are terraces twenty - one feet in width, and eight hundred and fifty - eight in length, extending from the very tasteful and indeed magnificent conservatory, to a rural temple in a secluded portion of the grounds. The house itself is one of those palaces of country gentlemen found in no part of the world but England, and equal or superior to the residences of royalty in many a state of Europe. The entrance hall, occupying the site of the north transept of the monkish Priory, is a noble apartment, sixty - one feet long, twenty - three wide, and forty high. It is illumined by painted windows of much beauty. The\" Great Window,\" consisting of four divisions, contains the effigies of various mighty potentates of Furness, Lancaster, and the Isle of Man, who gained, after their death, the good word and the prayers of the Monks by their benefactions to the Priory. The Hall contains various suits of\" complete steel.\" On the wall opposite the entrance, is a suit of plated armour, of the time of Henry the Seventh, and on the left-hand side on going in, is a suit of splint armour of a Knight of Edward the Fourth. All the other suits are of the sixteenth century, and combine with the dim religious hue of the painted glass, the gothic style of the architecture, and all the accessories and the vague traditionary interest of the site, to form a mingled but very pleasing picture of baronial and ecclesiastical grandeur. The cloisters in the latter respect give a still more decided colouring to it; but even here, the baronial obtrudes itself, in the shape of the black armour stuck against the walls. These cloisters, which are on the site of the real bona fide cloisters from which they derive their name, character, and appearance, are on hundred and seventy - seven feet long, nineteen and a quarter wide, and seventeen and a quarter high, and are of purely gothic architecture. The more modern looking apartments of the interior are fitted up in a style of luxurious elegance, and contain some fine pictures: amongst which, those in the North Drawing Room are the most celebrated. Here there are to be found a\" Descent from the Cross,\" by Caracci; the Death of Saint Sebastian, by Simon Vouet; a Saint Cecilia, by Domenichino; and a female portrait, by Sebastian del Piombo; besides an interior and figures, by Mieris; and a charming landscape and figures, by Wouvermans. The Morning Room contains two fine Guidos-- one of our Saviour, and the other the Virgin Mary; and two portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds-- one of Colonel Braddyll, when nine years old, and one of King George the Fourth, in his youth, presented by him to the Colonel as a token of his regard.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Furness Abbey",0,13],["Ulverstone",15,25],["Morecambe

Conishead there is a road leading by the side of the Leven Sands to Birkrigg, a hill from the top of which the most extensive view in the whole district of Low Furness is to be obtained. To the west may be seen, looming over the blue sea, the Isle of Man; from the north-west round to the east, the peaks and crests-- still presenting the same appearance of sublime confusion-- of the mountains of Blackcomb, Scawfell, Coniston Old Man, Helvellyn, Fairfield, Hill Bell, and a long range of nameless elevations as far as Ingleborough, in Yorkshire. From the east, southwards, the view includes the whole expanse of Morecambe bay, and the Lancashire coast, almost as far as Liverpool, and to the south-west the distant and hazy outline of North Wales; crowned in fine weather, by the towering sublimity of Snowdon himself. From this point to Furness Abbey, by way of Aldringham, Gleaston, and Dendron, is also a short and pleasant excursion, through a country abounding with beauties, to him who loves nature in all her forms, and who, when she is not magnificent enough to prompt his wonder never fails to find her beautiful enough to excite his admiration. At Gleaston are the ruins of a castle which struck our artist's fancy as it did ours. It is said that every old castle has an old story connected with it, could you but find it out; and that, moreover, such old story is always a love story, and always a doleful story, and consequently always worth the telling. Gleaston is doubtless no exception to the rule, though its legend must by us remain untold, for the satisfactory reason that we could not discover either from books or personal enquiry that it had one. It is therefore left for the next traveller to those regions, upon a\" book intent,\" to find or make one. It is believed to have been built by the lords of Aldringham, in consequence of the lower portion of the coast, in which they originally resided, having been swept away by the sea. The precise date of its erection is not known.

Furness Abbey somewhat disappointed me. I know many ruins that have not excited a tithe of the admiration, or caused a tithe of the noise in the world, that are much finer; and though it is doubtless a disadvantage to go to any celebrated place with the expectation over-raised, I cannot say that this was my case with Furness Abbey. The country around is moreover of no great beauty; and the railway somewhat spoils the picturesqueness of the effect by being brought under the very walls of the abbey-- which has itself had a very narrow escape of being run over, and dislocated in all its limbs and joints by it. The only access to the abbey is also unfavourable for disposing the tourist to a proper frame of mind for admiring it, being along a narrow, dirty, deep-rutted lane.

The word Furness is written Fruderness in the Domesday Book; and at a later period was formed into Futherness. Fruder, or Futher, is conjectured by Dr. Whitaker to have been a personal name-- probably, he says, that of the first Saxon proprietor or planter of the district; and Ness, a promontory. No etymologist seems to have hinted its derivation from Further or Further Ness-- the further promontory, which, to an inhabitant of Cartmel or Lancaster, would have been a very correct designation of it. Leaving that point, however, let us return to the abbey itself. A religious house was originally established at Amounderness in 1124, which was transferred in 1127 to Furness-- described as in the vale of Beckansgill, or the valley of Deadly Night Shade. Stephen endowed the abbey richly. The abbot was lord paramount, and feudal baron of the whole district of Furness. All the people were his vassals, and all the mesne lords did him homage and fealty,\" to be true to him against all men excepting the king. Every mesne lord obeyed the summons of the abbot or his steward, in raising his quota of armed men; and every tenant of a whole tenement furnished a man and horse of war for guarding the coasts, for the border service, or for an expedition against the common enemy of the king and kingdom.\" The lordship of the abbot extended over the whole peninsula, with the Isle of Foulney, the Pile of Fouldrey, and the Isle of Walney adjoining. It commenced on the north at the Shire Stones, or Wrynose, and descended by Elterwater to Windermere, and by the outlet of the lake at Newby Bridge by the course of the Leven, and over Leven Sands into the sea. To the north-east it took the line of Duddon Mouth, and the River Duddon, which it ascended, and so on to Wrynose again, its point of departure. The abbot's power over this region was absolute. From the time of King Stephen until the dissolution of the religious houses, a period of upwards of four hundred years, despot succeeded to despot in this little remote principality. The abbot was not only the high priest, but the baron, judge, captain, and coroner, of the district. He and all his monks were free of all dues, taxes, tolls, amerciaments, levies, tallages, and pontages. He issued summonses and attachments by his own bailiffs. He had the return of all writs, and the sheriff of any neighbouring county, or any county whatever, was prohibited, by himself, or by his officers, from entering this privileged ground upon any pretext of office whatever; and no man was to presume to disturb or molest the holy baron, or any of his tenants, under penalty of ten pounds to the king, besides such penalties as the abbot himself might think it proper to wrest from him. The dress of the monks was a white cassock, with a cowl and scapulary of the same. Their legion, shortly prioer to the dissolution, consisted of four divisions; first, of bowmen, horsed and harnessed; second, of billmen, horsed and harnessed; third, of bowmen on foot; and fourth, of billmen on foot. A large company of them fought under the conduct of Sir Edward Stanley, against the Scotch, at the disastrous battle, for Scotland, of Flodden Field, as we learn from a line of choice alliteration in the ancient ballad.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Furness",183,190],["Furness Abbey",195,208],["Furness",352,359],["Furness",896,903],["Furness",1055,1062],["Cartmel",1477,1484],["Lancaster",1488,1497],["Furness",1910,1917],["Isle",2419,2423],["Foulney",2427,2434],["Isle",2466,2470],["Walney",2474,2480],["Wrynose",2542,2549],["Elterwater",2568,2578],["Windermere",2582,2592],["Newby Bridge",2627,2639],["Leven",2661,2666],["Leven Sands",2677,2688],["Duddon",2741,2747],["River Duddon",2763,2775],["Wrynose",2809,2816],["Scotland",4199,4207],["Flodden Field",4212,4225]],"geonouns":[["points",38,44],["hills",416,421],["wood",449,453],["valleys",459,466],["lakes",479,484],["rivers",489,495],["forests",516,523],["ground",886,892],["abbey",953,958],["district",1310,1318],["promontory",1332,1342],["promontory",1438,1448],["point",1562,1567],["abbey",1599,1604],["house",1625,1630],["vale",1746,1750],["valley",1774,1780],["abbey",1824,1829],["district",1898,1906],["coasts",2245,2251],["common",2310,2316],["outlet",2605,2611],["lake",2619,2623],["sea",2698,2701],["line",2733,2737],["point",2828,2833],["region",2876,2882],["houses",2966,2972],["district",3171,3179],["county",3410,3416],["county",3425,3431],["ground",3520,3526],["foot",4039,4043],["foot",4071,4075],["line",4246,4250]],"pos_words":[["prominent",28,37],["valuable",161,169],["work",170,174],["picturesque",646,657],["erudite",739,746],["variety",781,788],["classic",878,885],["correct",1522,1529],["richly",1830,1836],["paramount",1857,1866],["homage",1984,1990],["succeeded",3024,3033],["free",3207,3211],["privileged",3509,3519],["holy",3615,3619],["proper",3750,3756]],"neg_words":[["ruin",78,82],["dark",258,262],["backward",267,275],["lying",360,365],["wild",390,394],["crowded",565,572],["enemy",2317,2322],["dissolution",2937,2948],["despot",3017,3023],["despot",3037,3043],["disturb",3593,3600],["molest",3604,3610],["penalty",3656,3663],["wrest",3760,3765],["dissolution",3895,3906],["disastrous",4176,4186]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",253,257],["several centuries",370,387],["the year 1127",1031,1044],["1124",1677,1681],["1127",1708,1712],["a period of",2974,2985],["four hundred years",2997,3015]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",605,612],["upwards",2986,2993]],"spa_preps":[["about",804,809],["into",1140,1144],["against",2022,2029],["against",2298,2305],["over",2384,2388],["over",2672,2676],["into",2689,2693],["over",2866,2870],["under",3650,3655],["under",4108,4113],["against",4149,4156]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969041944},{"para_id":175,"paragraph":"\" From Bowland, billmen bold were boun, With such as Bottom Banks did hide; From Wharemore up to Whittington, And all to Wenning water side:","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["water",129,134]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.23,"roberta_sentiment":0.9972462654},{"para_id":176,"paragraph":"From Silverdale to Kent Sand side, Whose soil is sown with cockle shells, From Cartmil ake, and Coniside With fellows fierce from Furness fells.\"","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Silverdale",5,15],["Kent",19,23],["Furness",130,137]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["fierce",118,124]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0588235294,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969197512},{"para_id":177,"paragraph":"The abbots of Furness, being very wealthy, exercised great hospitality; but little is recorded of their doings, either in war or peace.

It thus happened, that for the long period of two hundred and seventy years, the names of only ten abbots appear on the list. The rents of the abbey, according to a manuscript in the Manchester Library, amounted in the 31st and 32nd of Edward I. to no less than 1599 l. 8 s 2 d.; but they are stated as amounting to no more than 946 l. 2 s 10 d. in the 26th of Henry Viii., two years before the dissolution. The last, and said to be the 31st, abbot in succession, was Roger Pyle. The charges against him and his monks were, that they had raised rebellion against the king; that the abbot had uttered falsehoods at the time of his visitation; that he had caused his monks to be forsworn; that he had concealed the treason of one Henry Salley, a monk, who had said that no Secular Knave should be head of the church; and of another who had said that the king was not the true king, or the right heir to the crown. Upon these accusations, two of the monks of Furness were committed to Lancaster Castle by the Earl of Sussex; and the abbot having been taken into custody, was prevailed upon to sign a proposal for the\" voluntary\" surrender of the abbey, which he did at Whalley, on the 5th of April, 1537. Henry provided for the abbot, the prior, and the twenty - eight monks who signed this document, although, it must be confessed, not very liberally. The abbot was made rector of Dalton, with a yearly revenue of 33 l; and the sum of 150 l. per annum, or thereabouts, was charged upon the revenues of the lordship, for the support of the other twenty - nine. The site, and immediate grounds of the abbey, were shortly afterwards sold to Thomas Preston, of Preston Patrick and Levens, Esq., from whom they descended, through various hands, to the Earl of Burlington, the present proprietor.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Furness",14,21],["Manchester",715,725],["Furness",1488,1495],["Lancaster Castle",1514,1530],["Dalton",1911,1917],["Preston",2175,2182],["Preston",2187,2194],["Levens",2207,2213]],"geonouns":[["abbey",675,680],["head",1327,1331],["church",1339,1345],["abbey",1675,1680],["grounds",2114,2121],["abbey",2129,2134]],"pos_words":[["wealthy",34,41],["great",53,58],["peace",129,134],["dignity",202,209],["right",1419,1424],["support",2054,2061]],"neg_words":[["death",398,403],["dissolution",927,938],["treason",1245,1252],["accusations",1455,1466],["surrender",1658,1667]],"events":[],"dates":[["ten years",358,367],["ten years",454,463],["seventy years",594,607],["the 31st and 32nd",747,764],["8",802,803],["2",806,807],["2",868,869],["two years",906,915],["the 31st",965,973],["the\"",1642,1646],["the 5th of April, 1537",1710,1732],["yearly",1926,1932]],"times":[["The last",940,948]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["against",1024,1031],["against",1087,1094],["into",1586,1590],["through",2247,2254]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0048780488,"vader_sentiment":-0.95,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9210348129},{"para_id":178,"paragraph":"From that time to the present, says Mr. Evans, in his history,\" the abbey itself-- not merely abandoned, and never favoured with timely repairs, but even despoiled of whatever was valuable, and often rudely mangled, in order that anything in its structure, which happened to be coveted, might be obtained-- rapidly sank into a state of dilapidation.

But from Broughton upwards to its source, or Wrynose Fells, the Duddon is beautiful exceedingly, and merits all the praises which the poet has lavished upon it, in the series of sonnets which he has devoted to a description of its charms. Broughton is built on the southern declivity of a short ascent or slope, which is surmounted by Broughton Tower, the residence of Mr. Sawrey. The town is small and uninteresting, the most important portion of it being included in a square of neat stone houses, roofed with slate, in the midst of which is an obelisk to the memory of a gentleman with the renowned name of John Gilpin, who it appears generously gave the ground for the formation of the area. From Broughton to Seathwaite the course of the Duddon is one of the most interesting rambles in the lake district. The vale upon which the traveller who would explore the beauties of this beautiful mountain stream now enters, is called Dunnersdale. If the river bed be not too full of water, and if the tourist have good limbs, and be fond of adventure, and of a varied succession of striking and romantic scenery, let him strike off from the high road, as soon after leaving Broughton as he can make it convenient, and proceed to Ulpha, tracing the stream in its very bed. He will find the task, though difficult, quite practicable; and every difficulty surmounted will display a new beauty to reward him for his toil. The account of the exploration of one mountain-stream in this rough but most agreeable method, will suffice with little or no change for that of another, and therefore it will not be necessary here to repeat a description which would not materially differ from that of Stockgill Force in a previous chapter. The Duddon, however, is a more powerful and imposing stream, and runs a longer course; consequently it offers a greater succession of scenery, but the character is the same upon a larger scale. Quiet and dull, from Broughton to the sea; it is noisy and delightful from Broughton to its source upon the heights of Wrynose; or, as Mr. Wordsworth beautifully pourtrays it in his twentieth sonnet in its praise:","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Broughton",206,215],["Wrynose",242,249],["Duddon",261,267],["Broughton",436,445],["Broughton Tower",532,547],["Sawrey",570,576],["Broughton",898,907],["Seathwaite",911,921],["Duddon",940,946],["Broughton",1369,1378],["Ulpha",1424,1429],["The Duddon",1921,1931],["Broughton",2136,2145],["Broughton",2190,2199],["Wrynose",2234,2241],["Wordsworth",2254,2264]],"geonouns":[["sands",156,161],["landscape",186,195],["slope",502,507],["residence",553,562],["town",582,586],["stone",683,688],["houses",689,695],["ground",855,861],["lake",993,997],["district",998,1006],["vale",1012,1016],["mountain",1091,1099],["stream",1100,1106],["river",1149,1154],["bed",1155,1158],["water",1178,1183],["road",1341,1345],["stream",1443,1449],["bed",1462,1465],["mountain",1651,1659],["stream",1660,1666],["stream",1974,1980],["sea",2153,2156]],"pos_words":[["smooth",144,150],["beautiful",271,280],["exceedingly",281,292],["important",624,633],["neat",678,682],["renowned",790,798],["generously",835,845],["interesting",966,977],["beautiful",1081,1090],["good",1209,1213],["fond",1228,1232],["striking",1277,1285],["romantic",1290,1298],["convenient",1397,1407],["beauty",1578,1584],["reward",1588,1594],["agreeable",1690,1699],["suffice",1713,1720],["powerful",1952,1960],["delightful",2174,2184],["beautifully",2265,2276],["praise",2321,2327]],"neg_words":[["strike",1316,1322],["difficult",1497,1506],["difficulty",1537,1547],["toil",1607,1611],["rough",1675,1680],["imposing",1965,1973],["dull",2125,2129],["noisy",2164,2169]],"events":[],"dates":[["twentieth",2297,2306]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["upwards",216,223],["here",1806,1810]],"spa_preps":[["over",80,84]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0717948718,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988711476},{"para_id":186,"paragraph":"The old inventive poets, had they seen Or rather felt the entrancement that detains Thy waters, Duddon,' mid these flowery plains, The still repose, the liquid lapse serene Transferred to bowers imperishably green, Had beautified Elysium; but these chains Will soon be broken:-- a rough course remains Rough as the past: where thou, of placid mien, Innocuous as a firstling of the flock, And countenanced like a soft cerulean sky Shalt change thy temper, and with many a shock, Given and received in mutual jeopardy, Dance like a Bacchanal from rock to rock, Tossing her frantic thyrsus wide and high.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Duddon",96,102]],"geonouns":[["waters",88,94],["rock",545,549],["rock",553,557]],"pos_words":[["inventive",8,17],["serene",166,172],["like",405,409],["soft",412,416],["like",523,527]],"neg_words":[["lapse",160,165],["rough",281,286],["temper",447,453],["shock",471,476],["jeopardy",507,515],["frantic",571,578]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["past",315,319]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0153846154,"vader_sentiment":-0.76,"roberta_sentiment":0.9721365571},{"para_id":187,"paragraph":"The first halting place upon Duddon banks will be Ulpha, pronounced Oopha, situated, with its lonely Kirk, upon an eminence, and commanding a fine view.

The place is not only remarkable for its extreme beauty and seclusion, but for the his tory of its famous clergyman, Robert Walker; or, as the guide books call him,\" the wonderful clergyman.\" There is a very full account of him in the notes already alluded to. He was born in 1709, at a place called Under Crag, in the valley of Seathwaite. He became curate of Seathwaite, in his twenty - sixth year, and continued curate until the day of his death, when he had attained the great age of ninety - three. His curacy was of the yearly value of 5 l. only! and he had no fortune whatever. He married a wife in his twenty - seventh year, who brought him a\" fortune\" of forty pounds; and in due time a family of twelve children, of whom eight survived. The wonder of his history is, that he educated all his children respectably, made one of them a clergyman; was hospitable to all, and generous to his poorer neighbours; and at his death left a sum of 2000 l. behind him. It is true the income of his curacy was by degrees increased to 50 l. per annum; but as this would not account for the accumulation of such a sum, we are led to inquire how he could have managed it, with so many claims upon him, and all so well attended to. It appears that he was as expert at various trades as Robinson Crusoe himself. He spun with his own hands all the wool needed for the clothes of himself, his wife, and his family; and while spinning taught the children of his parishioners spelling and reading. He assisted, for hire in haymaking and sheep-shearing: and for hire, acted as clerk and scrivener to the simple people, who were not initiated in the sublime mysteries of the pen. He had moreover a couple of acres of land, which he cultivated by his own labour, and that of his sons; kept and bred cattle; and, though Mr. Wordsworth says nothing of his past of the story, brewed ale, and sold it for two - pence a quart, if drunk in the adjoining field, and for four pence if drunk in the parsonage.* The wonder very sensibly diminishes when we learn these facts; as, in a similar manner, did that of the inquirer into the history of St. Saviour's Church, Southwark, which was built by a poet. The wonder in this case was, that a poet could have possessed money enough to erect a church; but when it was explained that he was a lawyer as well as a poet, there was no wonder in the business. The fortune of the poor curate would have been equally marvellous; but the profits upon the ale and the other et ceteras, make the story intelligible.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Seathwaite",0,10],["Duddon",187,193],["Wordsworth",249,259],["Crag",577,581],["Seathwaite",600,610],["Seathwaite",632,642],["Wordsworth",2079,2089]],"geonouns":[["stream",159,165],["valley",590,596],["land",1974,1978],["field",2204,2209],["church",2537,2543]],"pos_words":[["recommended",14,25],["admirer",84,91],["master",111,117],["glowing",212,219],["remarkable",293,303],["beauty",320,326],["famous",370,376],["wonderful",441,450],["great",746,751],["fortune",838,845],["fortune",923,930],["wonder",1022,1028],["educated",1056,1064],["hospitable",1129,1139],["generous",1152,1160],["led",1392,1395],["well",1478,1482],["sublime",1907,1914],["wonder",2262,2268],["sensibly",2274,2282],["wonder",2455,2461],["enough",2519,2525],["well",2595,2599],["wonder",2624,2630],["fortune",2652,2659],["marvellous",2703,2713],["intelligible",2785,2797]],"neg_words":[["death",714,719],["poorer",1168,1174],["death",1198,1203],["drunk",2181,2186],["drunk",2233,2238],["poor",2667,2671]],"events":[],"dates":[["a couple of days",59,75],["1709",547,551],["twenty - sixth year",651,670],["the day of",699,709],["yearly",797,803],["5",813,814],["twenty - seventh year",881,902],["forty",935,940],["50",1302,1304]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",172,176],["left",1204,1208],["past",2110,2114],["there",2611,2616]],"spa_preps":[["behind",1226,1232],["into",2371,2375]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0871369295,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986971021},{"para_id":191,"paragraph":"In the church-yard of Seathwaite, under a fine old yew tree, this singular character and his wife are buried.

Tradition rather than history records that the victor seized the son of the defeated monarch, and put out his eyes before his father's face, and then put them both to death. The kingdom of Cumbria was afterwards given to Malcolm, King of Scotland, to hold in fealty. A wall which is said to divide the counties of Westmorland and Cumberland is built through the cairn; but the small stream on the right of the Raise is more generally considered as the boundary line.

It is three miles in length, and rarely exceeds a quarter of a mile in breadth, and is the highest lake in Cumberland.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",5,14],["Keswick",18,25],["Rydal",127,132],["Mount",143,148],["Grasmere",166,174],["Grasmere",183,191],["Helm Crag",284,293],["Steel Fell",393,403],["Seat Sandal",420,431],["Scotland",978,986],["Westmorland",1054,1065],["Cumberland",1070,1080],["Wythburn",1265,1273],["Helvellyn",1326,1335],["Patterdale",1370,1380],["Ulleswater",1385,1395],["Wythburn",1446,1454],["Leathes Water",1532,1545],["Cumberland",1681,1691]],"geonouns":[["vale",158,162],["road",196,200],["point",464,469],["road",477,481],["sea",511,514],["stones",552,558],["wall",1009,1013],["stream",1123,1129],["line",1201,1205],["inn",1258,1261],["inn",1421,1424],["lake",1486,1490],["lake",1673,1677]],"pos_words":[["beautiful",36,45],["defeat",668,674],["defeated",816,824],["right",1137,1142],["beautiful",1476,1485],["exceeds",1614,1621]],"neg_words":[["imposing",267,275],["death",679,684],["death",907,912]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",300,304],["the year 945",611,623]],"times":[],"distances":[["720 feet",492,500],["a mile and a quarter",1230,1250],["about a mile",1428,1440],["three miles",1580,1591],["a quarter of a mile",1622,1641]],"loc_advs":[["between",385,392],["above",501,506],["there",522,527],["without",1336,1343]],"spa_preps":[["between",377,384],["out",842,845],["through",1090,1097],["into",1365,1369]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0192307692,"vader_sentiment":0.7,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986034036},{"para_id":197,"paragraph":"Pedestrians who would see Thirlemere and Helvellyn at the most favourable point of view, must cross the fields to a place called City, at the head of the Lake; after passing this primitive village, containing about half a dozen houses, the road leads through a narrow lane, and by a wild Cliff to the left, called Bull Cragss, from whence a view of Helvellyn is seen rearing its lordly head at the other side of the Lake, the road running along its base.

The house, which we soon came in sight of, is named from the river, Greta Hall, and is situated on a gentle eminence, at a considerable distance from the road. The entrance is a rustic wicket gate-- on opening which we found ourselves in a narrow avenue of trees, at the extremity of which we saw the house. We walked up to it leisurely, devising, as we went, how we should procure admission, and whether we should content ourselves with an outside view of a place so celebrated. On arriving at the door we found neither bell nor knocker. Some of the shutters were shut, and all were newly painted; and on looking through one of the windows, we saw a newly painted and papered room without furniture, and as if it had been but a moment before evacuated by painters and carpenters. This gave us hope that we could procure admission without disturbing any one, or appearing guilty of intrusiveness or incivility, of which there would have been some risk if the house had been inhabited.

The garden was neglected; it showed that he-- and she also, the amiable hostess who had loved to tend it, had departed. It was uncropped, and going into the rank luxuriance of weeds, and showed at every turn the want of the hand of its former mistress. In the midst of our stroll amid its deserted walks, we saw a workman with a key in his hand coming up the avenue, and, proceeding to meet him, we asked whether we could procure admission. He replied in the affirmative, and offered to conduct us over the house, which he informed us was to be let. As he seemed to think that we had come on business, and had a desire of looking at the house for the purpose of hiring it, we undeceived him in this particular, and told him that curiosity alone, and respect for the memory of its late illustrious occupant, had induced us to trouble him. The man was intelligent, and very obliging; and though but a journeyman painter, seemed as fully impressed as we were, with the greatness of the claim that Robert Southey had upon the affectionate reverence of posterity. He told us that very many persons visited the house solely on this account, and that there was, he thought, scarcely a tourist to the Lake districts who did not make a point of coming into the garden at least, though most of them lacked courage to demand admission into the house. The garden, he said, had suffered severely, from the reverence of travellers-- and the ladies, especially, carried away flowers and leaves of shrubs to preserve as mementos; so that he feared, if the house were not let in a year or two, there would not be a shrub or a flower left. This worthy fellow led us over the building, which was large and commodious, showed us the kitchen, the wine-cellar, the dining-room, the drawing-room, and the study; each of which recalled painfully to our minds-- at least they did so to mine-- the bodily absence of one whose spirit yet spoke to mankind, and exerted an influence upon their thoughts. The room that had been the library was especially painful to reflect upon. The marks on the walls where the shelves had been fitted were still uneffaced by the painter's brush; but the beloved books which it had been the pleasure of his life to collect, were all dispersed; and not one, or a shred of one, was left behind, of the many thousands that had formerly made the spot a living temple of literature. It would have been worth preserving these for Keswick; and I thought, and still think, that if the town had been rich enough to make the purchase of the whole property, it would have conferred upon itself, not only honour, but advantage. We were afterwards led into several smaller apartments, and, among others, into a room of a very peculiar shape-- a long, narrow parallelogram, with a door in one corner, and a solitary window looking into the garden at the other, and allowing, from the thickness of the foliage outside, but little light to penetrate into the interior.

We finally determined to send for a guide and boatman; and be rowed down the lake to the celebrated waterfall of Lodore, if the weather gave any signs during the morning of a more propitious day. When the guide made his appearance, he asked a sum that appeared exorbitant, which we should nevertheless in all probability have given him, if there had been any chance of sunshine when we got upon the bosom of Derwentwater. The very reverse of this seemed likely; and as we were bargaining, it began to rain, and soon after it came down in torrents. The boatman, however, seemed to think that we ought to have gone in spite of the wet; and retired in a humour that did not seem the pleasantest in the world. When the sky cleared, in less than an hour afterwards, we determined to walk by the shore of the lake to Lodore, being informed that it was not much above five miles, and that the road afforded finer views of the scenery than could be obtained from the lake. We started accordingly, and meeting our guide, inquired the nearest way. We thought, from the leer with which he replied, and the sly look that he gave to his companions, that he was misdirecting us. Nevertheless we walked on for about a mile, when, meeting a man coming in the opposite direction, we inquired of him, and learned that our suspicions were correct, and that if we had continued as directed, we should have found ourselves at the end of two hours back again at Keswick, without having seen Lodore at all. He kindly put us in the right way, accompanying us himself for a considerable distance. We learned from him that he was an auctioneer in Keswick, and that he had sold Southey's household goods a few months before. He said that the articles all fetched high prices, and that his walking-stick was sold for fifty - five shillings. He much regretted, of course, that he had not had the selling of his goods, which he thought would have fetched double the price in Keswick that they had brought at London. On leaving us he put his card into our hands, from which we learned that his name was Joseph Brown, and that he was not only an auctioneer, but a guide, boatman, and mineralogist, and dealer in black-lead pencils. As he did not lead us astray, like his compeers, and was an intelligent and obliging man, and spoke with indignation of the rapacity of some of the most pertinacious of the guides that swarm about the place, his name is here given for the advantage of all whom it may concern.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Lodore",228,234],["Derwentwater",523,535],["Lodore",926,932],["Keswick",1555,1562],["Lodore",1584,1590],["Keswick",1736,1743],["Keswick",2060,2067],["London",2093,2099]],"geonouns":[["lake",192,196],["waterfall",215,224],["shore",905,910],["lake",918,922],["road",1001,1005],["lake",1074,1078]],"pos_words":[["celebrated",204,214],["propitious",295,305],["humour",766,772],["cleared",834,841],["finer",1015,1020],["correct",1435,1442],["kindly",1602,1608],["right",1623,1628],["lead",2301,2305],["lead",2329,2333],["like",2345,2349],["intelligent",2375,2386],["advantage",2554,2563]],"neg_words":[["cloudy",32,38],["undecided",82,91],["exorbitant",376,386],["spite",731,736],["leer",1174,1178],["sly",1210,1213],["suspicions",1419,1429],["regretted",1936,1945],["astray",2337,2343],["indignation",2420,2431],["pertinacious",2468,2480],["concern",2583,2590]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",306,309],["the end of two hours",1520,1540],["a few months before",1792,1811]],"times":[["next morning",15,27],["the morning",273,284],["less than an hour",846,863]],"distances":[["five miles",976,986],["about a mile",1310,1322]],"loc_advs":[["there",455,460],["without",1564,1571],["here",2535,2539]],"spa_preps":[["down",183,187],["down",645,649],["above",970,975],["opposite",1358,1366],["into",2131,2135],["about",2506,2511]],"normalised_sentiment":0.004950495,"vader_sentiment":0.77,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9923749566},{"para_id":212,"paragraph":"We soon found ourselves on the shores of Derwentwater.

It takes its name from being the place which the monks of Furness used as a granary, where they laid up the tithe. It forms, with its neat bridge and its lofty crags, covered with luxuriant trees, a picture which is the admiration of all who love seclusion in the midst of beauty. The commanding mountains, or Fells of Borrodale, amongst which Glaramara is conspicuous in the front, and the Scawfell Pikes in the far distance, seem to forbid all further progress in this direction. He who presses onwards soon discovers that there is a road; and if he be a traveller of taste, discovers also that all the views it presents to him from various points are of the grandest kind. The pass into Borrodale is both narrow and straight, the whole width being occupied by the road, and by the clear river that runs its course through rocky and precipitous banks, into the lake. Here attention is first arrested by an eminence called Castle Crag, on which, according to tradition, the Romans erected a fort, to command the entrance of this wild region. No traces of it remain, although the Saxons after them, and the monks of Furness Abbey, to whom all Borrodale belonged, maintained it at a still later period for the same purpose. From the summit of this crag, looking northwards, are to be seen the whole of the blue expanse of Derwentwater, with all its islands; the sweet village of Grange in front, the heights above Lodore to Watendlath, on the western road, by which we came; and on the opposite shore Manesty, the Cat Bells, Portinscale, and Crosthwaite; the imposing majesty of Skiddaw shutting up the scene. Looking southwards into Borrodale, we see the village of Rosthwaite, apparently at the feet of Glaramara and the Eagle Crag, and a mass of mountains still further beyond. Descending again into the road, we come in sight of the famous Bowder, or Boulder Stone, a large fragment of rock, which at some distant period has been hurled from the neighbouring mountains. It bears some resemblance to a ship lying keel upwards-- a resemblance which Mr. Wordsworth thus alludes to.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Lodore",31,37],["Grange",62,68],["Derwent",113,120],["Furness",180,187],["Borrodale",441,450],["Glaramara",466,475],["Scawfell",513,521],["Pikes",522,527],["Borrodale",812,821],["Castle Crag",1046,1057],["Furness Abbey",1238,1251],["Borrodale",1265,1274],["Derwentwater",1443,1455],["Grange",1500,1506],["Lodore",1535,1541],["Watendlath",1545,1555],["Manesty",1622,1629],["Cat Bells",1635,1644],["Portinscale",1646,1657],["Crosthwaite",1663,1674],["Skiddaw",1700,1707],["Borrodale",1755,1764],["Rosthwaite",1788,1798],["Glaramara",1826,1835],["Eagle Crag",1844,1854],["Wordsworth",2176,2186]],"geonouns":[["inn",24,27],["village",51,58],["banks",91,96],["river",104,109],["bridge",261,267],["crags",282,287],["trees",312,317],["mountains",418,427],["road",658,662],["points",765,771],["pass",802,806],["road",889,893],["river",912,917],["banks",969,974],["lake",985,989],["entrance",1135,1143],["region",1157,1163],["summit",1354,1360],["crag",1369,1373],["islands",1470,1477],["village",1489,1496],["road",1572,1576],["shore",1616,1621],["village",1777,1784],["feet",1818,1822],["mountains",1870,1879],["road",1928,1932],["rock",2011,2015],["mountains",2084,2093],["ship",2126,2130]],"pos_words":[["neat",256,260],["luxuriant",302,311],["admiration",342,352],["love",364,368],["beauty",395,401],["progress",576,584],["eminence",1030,1038],["sweet",1483,1488],["majesty",1689,1696],["famous",1958,1964]],"neg_words":[["conspicuous",479,490],["forbid",557,563],["rocky",947,952],["precipitous",957,968],["wild",1152,1156],["imposing",1680,1688],["lying",2131,2136]],"events":[],"dates":[["the clear",902,911],["a still",1302,1309]],"times":[],"distances":[["About a mile",0,12]],"loc_advs":[["beyond",13,19],["there",647,652],["northwards",1383,1393],["beyond",1894,1900]],"spa_preps":[["amongst",452,459],["into",807,811],["through",939,946],["into",976,980],["above",1529,1534],["opposite",1607,1615],["into",1750,1754],["into",1919,1923]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0160427807,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987851977},{"para_id":228,"paragraph":"Upon a semi-cirque of turf-clad ground, The hidden nook discovered to our view, A mass of rock, resembling, as it lay Right at the foot of that moist precipice, A stranded ship, with keel upturned, that rests Fearless of winds and waves.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["ground",32,38],["nook",51,55],["rock",90,94],["foot",131,135],["precipice",150,159],["ship",172,176]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.44,"roberta_sentiment":0.9575825334},{"para_id":229,"paragraph":"The stone is sixty - two long, and thirty - six feet high; its circumference is eighty - four feet, and it weighs nearly eighteen hundred tons-- or, according to some authorities, within eight or ten tons of two thousand.

Following the River Esk, seawards, we pass Muncaster Castle, on a wood-crowned steep, the ancient seat of the family of the Penningtons, Earls of Muncaster. The country in this neighbourhood, now green and luxuriant with wood, is said to have been bleak and bare before the late Earl undertook its improvement. He covered the hills with trees-- now of a goodly growth; introduced various breeds of cattle; irrigated the fields; and increased his own wealth, and the wealth of his dependants, by his judicious expenditure. About a mile and a half to the east of the castle, on the opposite side of the Esk, upon an eminence called Birkby Fell, are ruins of considerable extent, which the country people call the remains of the ancient\" city of Barnscar.\" They extend for about three hundred yards one way, and one hundred the other; and have long puzzled antiquaries to account for them-- as there is no historical record in existence which throws the smallest light upon the subject. The small market and sea-port town of Ravenglass is about a mile and a half from Muncaster, at the confluence of two small streams, called the Mite and the Irt; but it is in no respect remarkable. From this place, we follow the high road to Whitehaven, as far as Gosforth, where the lover of the picturesque will admire the situation and architecture of the church; and where the antiquary will delay his steps for a short time to take a look at a tall cross in the churchyard, supposed to have been erected by the Danes. From thence to the bridge over the River Calder, is about two and a half miles. On the north side of this stream, a mile above the bridge, are the ruins of Calder Abbey, founded so early as 1134, for Cistercian monks; and forming an adjunct to the superior and parent establishment of Furness. It is a small, but beautiful ruin; and the tourist has an additional inducement to visit it, from the fact that on the opposite side of the river are the vestiges of a Roman encampment. A modern house has been built upon a portion of the site of the ancient abbey. The church connected with it, was, says the Rev. Mr. Ford, in his Description of the Scenery of the Lake District,\" of the usual cross form. The south side of the nave is gone. The west door is good Norman, but plain. The nave consists of five arches, now overgrown with ivy. The centre tower stands on four pointed arches, supported by lofty piers. The east end of the choir is gone. It had no lateral lights, but the walls are adorned with long slender pillars and niches; and on the south side are four circular niches, foliated, one being pierced as a door. There are the remains of cloisters on the south side, sufficient to show them to have been beautiful specimens of early English. There are some old monuments with recumbent figures. The grounds are kept in excellent order; the greensward is beautiful; and no noxious weeds are allowed to disfigure the precincts of this once hallowed shrine.\"","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Wastdale",5,13],["Eskdale",18,25],["Castle",99,105],["Gosforth",107,115],["Newton",127,133],["Egremont",135,143],["Copeland Forest",149,164],["Ennerdale",169,178],["Buttermere",186,196],["Crummock Water",202,216],["Newlands",228,236],["Keswick",251,258],["River Esk",274,283],["Castle",313,319],["Barnscar",1003,1011],["Ravenglass",1282,1292],["Mite",1387,1391],["Whitehaven",1485,1495],["Gosforth",1507,1515],["River",1801,1806],["Calder Abbey",1922,1934],["Furness",2051,2058],["Ford",2378,2382],["Lake District",2425,2438]],"geonouns":[["pass",298,302],["wood",326,330],["seat",358,362],["country",421,428],["wood",481,485],["hills",586,591],["fields",680,686],["castle",825,831],["country",947,954],["market",1254,1260],["sea",1265,1268],["port",1269,1273],["town",1274,1278],["streams",1367,1374],["road",1477,1481],["church",1602,1608],["bridge",1785,1791],["stream",1872,1878],["bridge",1897,1903],["river",2200,2205],["house",2255,2260],["abbey",2318,2323],["church",2329,2335],["door",2511,2515],["tower",2612,2617],["piers",2668,2673],["walls",2744,2749],["door",2881,2885],["monuments",3035,3044],["grounds",3073,3080]],"pos_words":[["interesting",67,78],["luxuriant",466,475],["improvement",558,569],["goodly",614,620],["judicious",759,768],["eminence",874,882],["respect",1421,1428],["remarkable",1429,1439],["lover",1527,1532],["picturesque",1540,1551],["admire",1557,1563],["superior",2014,2022],["beautiful",2079,2088],["modern",2248,2254],["good",2519,2523],["supported",2649,2658],["sufficient",2941,2951],["beautiful",2978,2987],["excellent",3093,3102],["beautiful",3128,3137],["hallowed",3212,3220]],"neg_words":[["steep",339,344],["bleak",508,513],["ruins",907,912],["puzzled",1106,1113],["delay",1639,1644],["ruins",1913,1918],["ruin",2089,2093],["vestiges",2214,2222],["noxious",3146,3153]],"events":[],"dates":[["two and a half",1824,1838],["1134",1956,1960]],"times":[],"distances":[["About a mile and a half",782,805],["about a mile and a half",1296,1319],["a mile",1880,1886]],"loc_advs":[["there",26,31],["there",1151,1156],["above",1887,1892]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",840,848],["about",1030,1035],["over",1792,1796],["about",1818,1823],["opposite",2179,2187]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0413793103,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985098243},{"para_id":245,"paragraph":"Ponsonby Hall, standing in a park, on the opposite side of the high road to Whitehaven, will scarcely delay the steps of the traveller, who, if he be bound to Ennerdale and Buttermere by the nearest route, will strike off here to the right, through Copeland Forest.

St. Bees is so called from Bega, an Irish lady, contemporary of the famous St. Columba. She was canonized in the seventh century, and founded here, in the year 650, a small monastery. Several years afterwards a church was erected in connection with it, and a small town gradually grew around them both. The monastery was destroyed by the Danes, and lay for some time in ruins, but was restored by William de Malines, believed to be the same who built Calder Abbey, in the twelfth century. After the dissolution of the monasteries a free-school was founded from its revenues by Archbishop Grindall, from which the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland have derived great benefit. Recently under the patrongage of the late Earl of Lonsdale, a college has been established for the education of ministers of the Church of England, which is said to be in a flourishing condition. Mr. Wordsworth, the influence of whose genius is, as far as this region is concerned, ubiquitous, has a poem written in 1833, upon the beauties of St. Bees, composed\" in a steam boat off the coast,\" in which, with a similar feeling to that which prompted his famous sonnet against the Kendal and Windermere railway, he praises the past at the expense of the present; and refuses full justice to the spirit of the present age, and its great mechanical handmaid, Steam. The following is the complaint of a bard who prefers the sail to the paddle wheel; and who carries the same feeling, into his spiritual as well as into his material philosophy:--","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Egremont",5,13],["St. Bees",17,25],["St. Bees",218,226],["Calder Abbey",669,681],["Westmoreland",843,855],["Cumberland",860,870],["England",1038,1045],["Wordsworth",1099,1109],["St. Bees",1242,1250],["Kendal",1380,1386],["Windermere",1391,1401]],"geonouns":[["town",71,75],["village",87,94],["ridge",123,128],["vale",149,153],["abbey",211,216],["church",429,435],["town",483,487],["school",755,761],["region",1160,1166],["boat",1273,1277],["coast",1286,1291],["railway",1402,1409]],"pos_words":[["pleasant",31,39],["remarkable",179,189],["famous",286,292],["restored",603,611],["free",750,754],["great",884,889],["benefit",890,897],["flourishing",1072,1083],["genius",1134,1140],["famous",1354,1360],["great",1529,1534],["prefers",1608,1615],["spiritual",1689,1698],["well",1702,1706]],"neg_words":[["ruins",198,203],["ruins",588,593],["dissolution",717,728],["concerned",1170,1179],["refuses",1466,1473],["complaint",1584,1593]],"events":[],"dates":[["the seventh century",327,346],["the year 650",369,381],["Several years",402,415],["the twelfth century",686,705],["1833",1215,1219]],"times":[],"distances":[["four miles",48,58]],"loc_advs":[["here",360,364],["past",1426,1430]],"spa_preps":[["down",104,108],["into",130,134],["around",503,509],["under",908,913],["against",1368,1375],["into",1680,1684],["into",1710,1714]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0529801325,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986183643},{"para_id":248,"paragraph":"This independence upon oar and sail, This new indifference to breeze or gale, This straight-lined progress furrowing a flat lea And regular as if locked in certainty-- Depress the hours.

She was respectably connected; but had not moved in a rank corresponding to Shelley's; and that accident brought him into my own neighbourhood, for his family, already estranged from him, were now thoroughly irritated by what they regarded as a m\u00e9salliance, and withdrew, or greatly reduced, his pecuniary allowances. Such, at least, was the story current. In this embarassment, his wife's father made over to him an annual income of 200 l.; and, as economy had become important, the youthful pair-- both, in fact, still children-- came down to the Lakes, supposing this region of Cumberland and Westmoreland to be a sequestered place, which it was, for eight months in the year, and also to be a cheap place-- which it was not. Another motive to this choice arose with the then Duke of Norfolk. He was an old friend of Shelley's family, and generously refused to hear a word of the young man's errors, except where he could do anything to relieve him from their consequences. His Grace possessed the beautiful estate of Gowbarrow Park, on Ulleswater, and other estates of greater extent in the same two counties; his own agents he had directed to furnish any accomodations that might meet Shelley's views; and he had written to some gentlemen amongst his agricultural friends in Cumberland, requesting them to pay such neighbourly attentions to the solitary young people as circumstances might place in their power. This bias being impressed upon Shelley's wanderings, naturally brought him to Keswick, as the most central and the largest of the little towns dispersed amongst the Lakes. Southey, made aware of the interest taken in Shelley by the Duke of Norfolk, with his usual kindness, immediately called upon him; and the ladies of Southey's family subsequently made an early call upon Mrs. Shelley. One of them mentioned to me, as occurring in this first visit, an amusing expression ot the youth ful matron, which, four years later, when I heard of her gloomy end, recalled with the force of a pathetic contrast, that icy arrest then chaining up her youthful feet for ever. The Shelleys had been induced by one of their new friends to take part of a house standing about half a mile out of Keswick, on the Penrith road; more, I believe, in that friend's intention for the sake of bringing them easily within his hospitalities, than for any beauty in the place. There was, however, a pretty garden attached to it. And whilst walking in this, one of the Southey party asked Mrs. Shelley if the garden had been let with their part of the house.

As the traveller advances, Bassenthwaite gradually spreads its clear blue expanse before his eyes. If he stops to admire the transcendent loveliness of the prospect, as he must do if he be a true devotee of nature, he will look behind him to the region from which he has come, and will behold the fair bosom of Derwentwater, hemmed in by wooded hills, with its sweet green islands, and guardian town of Keswick, sending up the thin light-blue smoke in curls and wreathlets to the sky. Proceeding further, Jinkin Hill and the village of Thornthwaite appear in sight to the right hand, with Bassenthwaite beyond them; while, on the left, the huge form of Grisdale Pike, 2580 feet in height, seems to guard the district of Grasmere, Buttermere, and Crummock Water. The next scene of the panorama is the rural and rich valley of Lorton, with the sparkling stream of the Cocker,( its very name suggestive of a lively, brawling, leaping river,) flowing through it, fall in in numerous cascades over its rocky bed. The valley is about three miles in length, and is famous in all the country round, and to a much wider circle of the admirers of Mr. Wordsworth's poetry, for a large and ancient yew tree.

The town is beautifully situated at the confluence of the Cocker and the Derwent. It consists mainly of two spacious streets, and has two handsome bridges; one over the Derwent consisting of two arches, and two hundred and seven ty feet in length; the other, a smaller one, over the Cocker, consisting of one arch, of one hundred and sixty feet span. Cockermouth sends two members to Parliament, and is a prosperous place, carrying on a considerable manufacture of coarse woollen goods, cotton checks, and ginghams. There is an ancient church, dedicated to All Saints, which has had the advantage of a modern renovation. Though well situated on an eminence, it has no great pretension to architectural beauty. The tower contains six bells, which every now and then give the inhabitants a taste of their quality, by their chimes. There is also a grammar school, founded in 1676, by Lord Wharton; various alms-houses and other charitable institutions, and a very handsome market-place. Its old castle, however, is its chief attraction to the tourist. It stands on an eminence, between the Derwent and the Cocker, and was built shortly after the Norman Conquest, by Waldieve, first Lord of Allendale. It is in the form of an irregular square, and was defended at the entrance by a portcullis, draw-bridge, and moat. On each side of the gate-way, leading to the interior court, is a dungeon, to which the curious visitor may obtain access if he pleases, though it is scarcely worth his while to penetrate into them. The south-west front, of which a considerable portion remains, forms the most picturesque part of the ruin. It stood on the brink of the precipice, overlooking both the rivers, and in this it is believed were the state rooms, and all the principal apartments. Under this tower there is a vault, thirty feet square, which is lighted by a small grated window, and approached by a descent of twelve steps, the roof being upheld by a single octagonal pillar, which branches out into ribs, supporting the groining. In the imaginary address of the spirit of Cockermouth Castle to Mr. Wordsworth, the poet gives the world some particulars of his own early fondness for exploring this and the other portions of the castle.

The weather was not favourable for the attempt when I left Keswick; with the hope of a clear day for the purpose, and not being able like some who are undeterred by no difficulties when once they have set their minds upon an object, to wait for perhaps a week or more for a fine day, I was compelled to leave the summits of both of them\" unvisited.\" For the advantage, however, of those who may chance to have no other guide than these pages, some account of both mountains, and of the way to their tops, may be acceptable, even though it be derived at second hand from the accounts of others. Keswick is the proper point of departure on either expedition. Skiddaw is surpassed in height by three other mountains in England; namely by the Scawfell, Scawfell Pikes, and Helvellyn: but is unsurpassed by any for sublimity and wildness. It rises to the height of 3022 feet above the level of the sea, and 2911 above Derwentwater; being only fifty - eight feet inferior to Helvellyn, and one hundred and thirty - eight inferior to Helvellyn, and one hundred and thirty - eight inferior to Scawfell Pike. From Keswick to its peak is a distance of six miles of almost continual ascent: but at so easy an angle generally, that the whole may be traversed on horseback. The approach is by the Penrith road for about half a mile, along the banks of Southey's favourite stream, the Greta, which rises between it and Saddleback. Having crossed the bridge beyond the toll bar, the road ascends towards the hill called Latrigg, which it skirts for some distance, and then strikes over a somewhat precipitous path to the barren moor called Skiddaw Forest, to the foor of the Low Man, where there is a fine spring of water. Blessed are the springs upon the mountain tops, as every one who has climbed a mountain will testify;-- and merry are the scenes there enacted, when the ascent is made in a company of three or four:-- as I could testify, if a description of the ascent of Ben Nevis, Ben Lomond, or Goatfell,\" visited,\" could with any propriety be introduced into the account of Skiddaw,\" unvisited.\" Beyond the first well, having the first and second summits, or Men, as they are called, on the left, the road ascends easily by a good beaten track to the third Man, which is the highest point that can be seen from the valley. \" From this elevated station,\" says Mr. Wordsworth,\" the whole extent of the vale beneath is most beautifully displayed.\" After passing the fourth and fifth heap of stones, the traveller will soon place himself upon the summit of the mountain. Derwentwater cannot be seen from the top, being hidden by other hills of less elevation. On the right of the third Man appears a most magnificent assemblage of mountains. In a south-western direction, is seen the sublime chain extending from Coniston to Ennerdale, amongst which, Scawfell stands pre-eminent, having on its left Great End, Hanging Knot, Bowfell, and the fells of Coniston; and on the right Lingmell Crags, Great Gable, Kirkfell, Black Sail, the Pillar, the Steeple, and the Hay Cock, with Yewbarrow and part of the Screes through Black Sail. Black Combe may be descried through an opening between the Gable and Kirkfell. To the north of the Ennerdale mountains are those of Buttermere; and High Crag, High Stile, and Red Pike peer over the Cat Bells, Robinson, and Hindscarth. Still further to the north, rising from the vale of Newlands, is Rawling End, whence aspiring, are Causey Pike, Scar Crag Top, Sail, Ill Crags, Grasmere, and Grisedale Pike. On the right of Grisedale Pike, and Hobcarten Crag is Low Fell, over which, when the atmosphere is clear, the northern part of the Isle of Man, and perhaps Ireland may be discovered. This, however, is a rare occurrence, not happening one day in a hundred. The town and Castle of Cockermouth are distinctly seen over the foot of Bassenthwaite, with Workington at the outlet of the Derwent on its left. Whitehaven is hid from view, but all the sea coast from St Bees' Head by the Solway Firth to Rockliffe Marsh may be easily traced. Over the northern end of Skiddaw, if the weather be favourable, Carlisle and the Scottish mountain of Criffell may be plainly seen. Eastward, Penrith and its Beacon are visible, with Crossfell in the distance; and far away to the south-east the broad head of Ingleborough towers over the Westmorland fells. Saddleback and Helvellyn, the latter due south, are prominent features in the landscape. Lancaster Sands are also visible at times through the gap of Dunmaile Raise; and, by the aid of a telescope, Lancaster Castle itself. No part of Windermere is ever visible, being hidden by the vast assemblage of intervening mountains. The traveller who wishes to vary his route, may descend into the vale of Bassenthwaite, to the Castle Inn, near Armathwaite; and return to Keswick either by the eastern or western shore of the lake, the former being eight and the latter ten miles.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",189,196],["Blencathra",200,210],["Keswick",271,278],["Keswick",806,813],["Skiddaw",869,876],["England",928,935],["Scawfell",951,959],["Scawfell",961,969],["Pikes",970,975],["Helvellyn",981,990],["Derwentwater",1125,1137],["Helvellyn",1181,1190],["Helvellyn",1239,1248],["Scawfell",1297,1305],["Pike",1306,1310],["Keswick",1317,1324],["Penrith",1496,1503],["Greta",1583,1588],["Saddleback",1617,1627],["Latrigg",1717,1724],["Skiddaw

Here, according to prior arrangement, I joined the stage coach that runs daily during the summer season from Keswick to Wigton, in connection with the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. The country now, as seen from the top of the coach, looked bleak and dreary. The gloomy slopes and coves of Skiddaw-- the bare heaths stretching in front-- the treeless wilds on every side-- the want of traffic of every kind-- the absence even of smoke to give signs of a human habitation-- all impressed the mind with a feeling of loneliness and desolation. It was not without regret, however, that I looked back towards Keswick and the glorious hills that surround it, and caught a last glimpse of Bassenthwaite-- the last of the lakes-- and of the beautiful country in which I had been spending so many pleasant days. Gradually, as the coach rolled on, their outlines grew dim, the weather became hazy and indistinct, and I lost all trace of them, long before mere distance would have obliterated them from the sight. Passing by Over Water-- whose existence the driver informed me of, giving me at the same time the additional information that it was the smallest of the lakes, and situated in a lonely and seldom-visited spot, but famous for prime trout, we whirled on through the small town of Ireby to Bolton Gate. At this last-mentioned place-- an antique, but miserable-looking corner of the world, we found a considerable uproar in the street( considerable for such a small place), occasioned by the arrival of a smart carriage, drawn by four horses, and containing an elderly gentleman and a young lady. Both of them were busily engaged in throwing from the carriage-windows great numbers of religious tracts, to gather which all the ragged urchins of the town had congregated. The weather being somewhat windy, many of the tracts were whirled into the air above the chimney-tops, while as many were driven down the road into the gutters; and there was great hooting and shouting and hallooing and merriment from the elder people, to see the children scampering after them in all directions. The occupants of the carriage seemed to have no knowledge of the mischief the wind was working among their tracts, but at intervals of a minute poured out fresh supplies from both sides of the carriage. As they rolled on before us towards Carlisle at a rapid pace, I could every now and then see a fair hand emerging from the carriage-window with a packet of tracts, and the next moment, the whole cargo fluttering and flying and whirling in the air, among the hedges, or sticking fast in the puddles of the road. How long they continued at this rate, I know not; nor how many hundred - weights of paper they thus distributed during their journey, I cannot say; but I know that our coachman amused himself all the way to Wigton by pointing out the paper relics that this eccentric couple had left behind them.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Armathwaite",5,16],["Skiddaw",112,119],["Blencathra",124,134],["Castle Inn",163,173],["Castle Inn",188,198],["Keswick",221,228],["Wigton",232,238],["Carlisle",243,251],["Keswick",392,399],["Wigton",403,409],["Maryport",434,442],["Carlisle",447,455],["Keswick",887,894],["Ireby",1564,1569],["Bolton",1573,1579],["Carlisle",2606,2614],["Wigton",3088,3094]],"geonouns":[["point",27,32],["summits",101,108],["road",211,215],["coach",340,345],["country",469,476],["top",499,502],["coach",510,515],["slopes",553,559],["coves",564,569],["hills",912,917],["country",1026,1033],["coach",1104,1109],["mere",1228,1232],["lakes",1439,1444],["town",1556,1560],["street",1710,1716],["carriage",1793,1801],["carriage",1933,1941],["town",2031,2035],["road",2191,2195],["carriage",2388,2396],["carriage",2560,2568],["carriage",2693,2701],["road",2875,2879]],"pos_words":[["impressed",760,769],["glorious",903,911],["beautiful",1016,1025],["pleasant",1071,1079],["famous",1500,1506],["smart",1787,1792],["great",1950,1955],["tops",2150,2154],["great",2228,2233],["merriment",2273,2282],["fresh",2522,2527],["rapid",2620,2625],["fair",2665,2669],["fast",2848,2852]],"neg_words":[["bleak",524,529],["dreary",534,540],["gloomy",546,552],["absence",696,703],["smoke",712,717],["loneliness",797,807],["desolation",812,822],["regret",843,849],["dim",1141,1144],["hazy",1165,1169],["lost",1192,1196],["obliterated",1253,1264],["lonely",1464,1470],["miserable",1633,1642],["uproar",1696,1702],["ragged",2009,2015],["mischief",2432,2440],["eccentric",3138,3147]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",356,361],["the summer season",369,386],["days",1080,1084]],"times":[["a minute",2502,2510]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",835,842],["there",2218,2223],["left",3159,3163]],"spa_preps":[["through",1538,1545],["into",2119,2123],["above",2132,2137],["down",2182,2186],["into",2196,2200],["among",2462,2467],["out",2518,2521],["among",2818,2823],["out",3107,3110],["behind",3164,3170]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0142857143,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9945368171},{"para_id":281,"paragraph":"Bolton Gate contains a venerable-looking church, which the coachman informed me was built, according to the tradition of the country, by the Devil; not with his own good-will, however, but constained to the service by that arch-wizard Michael Scott, of whom so many extraordinary stories are related.

Carlisle is the border city-- the city of King Arthur and his knights. It has been the scene of many a stout siege and bloody feud; of many a fierce foray, and mournful execution, and of many a just punishment upon traitors and reivers. It is, consequently, not to be pictured to the imagination without unusual interest. Old traditions of events like these have made it among the most remarkable of the cities of England; and it would be difficult to name another around which are clustered so many memories of such various degrees of attraction to the poetical and historical antiquary. Its approach from the south, though striking, gives no idea of its antiquity and former feudalism. It is situated in an extensive plain, surrounded in the distance by mountains, amongst which Saddleback, Skiddaw, and Crossfell, are prominent; and from afar off, with the smoke of its households hanging over it, does undoubtedly impress the imagination with ideas of the romantic. Nearer approach, however, dissipates this illusion. We lose sight of the valley, being in it, and of the mountains, in the presence of immediate objects. Tall chimneys rear their heads in considerable numbers, pouring forth steam and smoke, and with square buildings and their numerous windows, prove incontestably that modern Carlisle is a manufacturing city, and has associations very different from those of its former history. On entrance, the contrast between the past and the present becomes still more vivid. We see that its walls and gates have disappeared; that its streets are clean, wide, and comfortable, which no ancient streets in England ever were; and that it has altogether a juvenile, busy, and thriving appearance, giving few signs( to the eye at least) that it has been in existence above a century. It is true that two venerable relics, its Castle and its Cathedral, remain to attest its bygone grandeur and glory; but these are not immediately visible, and have to be sought out by the inquiring stranger; whilst all around him is modern and prosaic; and a mere reduplication of the same characteristics of English life and manners that he must have seen in a hundred other places. Still, however, it is\" merrie Carlisle\" and\" bonnie Carlisle,\" although like all other mundane things it has been changed by time; and is quite as much King Arthur's city as England is King Arthur's England; and brimfull of associations which the traveller will be at no loss to recall, of the crime and sorrow,-- the\" fierce wars and faithful loves\" of our ancestors from the year 800 downwards to 1745. Not that Carlisle is only a thousand years old. It has a much earlier origin than the year 800, having been founded by the Romans.

It was once more destroyed by the Danes, about the year 900, who threw down the walls, burnt its houses, chiefly built of wood, and killed every person in it, man, woman, and child. It remained in ruins, it is believed, for nearly two hundred years. On the return of William Rufus from Alnwick, after concluding a peace with the turbulent Scotch, he passed over the remains of this once celebrated city, and observing that it must have been a place of great strength, and could be made so again, he resolved to rebuild it for the protection of the Border. He did so; and Carlisle became of more importance than it had ever been before. Its Castle was built and garrisoned; and every means taken to render it a stronghold both for offensive and defensive warfare. Henry the First completed what what Rufus had so well begun, erected Carlisle into an episcopal see in the year 1132, making Athelwold, his confessor, the first Bishop.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",45,53],["Carlisle",186,194],["Northumberland",330,344],["Carlisle",1016,1024],["Castle",1085,1091],["Carlisle",1277,1285]],"geonouns":[["wall",385,389],["walls",525,530],["houses",542,548],["wood",567,571]],"pos_words":[["fabulous",25,33],["peace",759,764],["celebrated",832,842],["great",897,902],["protection",975,985],["well",1257,1261]],"neg_words":[["suffered",195,203],["ruins",289,294],["killed",577,583],["ruins",642,647],["turbulent",774,783],["offensive",1175,1184],["defensive",1189,1198]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year",492,500],["nearly two hundred years",669,693],["the year 1132",1311,1324]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["about",486,491],["down",516,520],["over",802,806],["into",1286,1290]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0086956522,"vader_sentiment":0.56,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980492592},{"para_id":350,"paragraph":"In Evan's Collection of Old Ballads, is one relating to a Bishop of Carlisle at this early period.

It is somewhat less known to the English reader, not being found in Percy's Reliques; and describes a scene which was very common to the Border for a long period. As it serves to illustrate the picturesque sketch of Mr. Gilbert on the opposite side, the principal portions of it, sufficient to tell the story, are here transcribed. In the year 1596, William Armstrong, of Kinmont, better known as Kinmont Willie, a good reiver, or Border trooper, and stealer of Englishmen's cattle, was taken prisoner by Lord Scrope, the Warden of the Western Marches, and safely lodged in Carlisle Castle. A truce existed at the time between Lord Scrope and the Lord of Buccleugh, who severally watched over the interests of the English and Scottish sides of the Border; and the Lord of Buccleugh, incensed that the truce had been broken by the capture of Willie, demanded that he should be set at liberty. Lord Scrope refused; and the Lord of Buccleugh, with a small body of two hundred men, performed the daring feat of surprising the Castle of Carlisle, and rescuing his countryman. The\" fause Sakelde,\" alluded to in the ballad, was the then possessor of Corby Castle, and Sheriff of Cumberland-- the chief of the powerful family of the Salkeldes; and\" Hairibee,\" was the slang phrase for the place of execution at Carlisle.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",137,145],["Carlisle",293,301],["Carlisle",907,915],["Castle",916,922],["Castle",1355,1361],["Carlisle",1365,1373],["Corby Castle",1477,1489],["Carlisle",1637,1645]],"geonouns":[["common",456,462]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",527,538],["sufficient",613,623],["better",714,720],["good",748,752],["safely",890,896],["interests",1030,1039],["liberty",1216,1223],["daring",1325,1331],["feat",1332,1336],["powerful",1536,1544]],"neg_words":[["prisoner",826,834],["broken",1149,1155],["refused",1237,1244]],"events":[],"dates":[["a long period",481,494],["the year 1596",668,681]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",647,651]],"spa_preps":[["around",176,182],["opposite",568,576],["between",952,959],["over",1021,1025]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0463576159,"vader_sentiment":0.91,"roberta_sentiment":0.9945547581},{"para_id":366,"paragraph":"Kinmont Willie.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9895095825},{"para_id":367,"paragraph":"Oh have ye ha heard o' the fause Sakelde, Oh have ye na heard o' the keen Lord Scrope, How they have taken bold Kinmont Willie On Hairibee to hang him up?","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["keen",69,73]],"neg_words":[["hang",142,146]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.76,"roberta_sentiment":0.9940350652},{"para_id":368,"paragraph":"Had Willie had but twenty men-- But twenty men as stout as he, Fause Sakelde had never the Kinmont ta' en Wi' eight score in his company.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.26,"roberta_sentiment":0.8513198495},{"para_id":369,"paragraph":"They bound his legs beneath the steed, They tied his hands behind his back, They guarded him, five score on each side, And brought him over the Liddel Rack.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beneath",20,27],["behind",59,65]],"spa_preps":[["over",135,139]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9325529933},{"para_id":370,"paragraph":"They led him through the Liddel Rack, And also through the Carlisle sands, They brought him to Carlisle Castell To be at my Lord Scrope's commands.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",59,67],["Carlisle",95,103]],"geonouns":[["sands",68,73]],"pos_words":[["led",5,8]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["through",13,20],["through",47,54]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0769230769,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977884293},{"para_id":371,"paragraph":"Now word is gone to the bold keeper In Branksome hall where that he lay, That Lord Scrope had taken Kinmont Willie Between the hours of night and day.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["hall",49,53]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["day",146,149]],"times":[["Between the hours of night",115,141]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.38,"roberta_sentiment":0.9906007051},{"para_id":372,"paragraph":"He struck the table with his hand, He made the red wine spring on hie--\" Now Christ's curse on my head;\" he said,\" But avenged on Lord Scrope I will be.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["table",14,19],["head",98,102]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["struck",3,9],["curse",86,91]],"events":[],"dates":[["spring",56,62]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.1,"vader_sentiment":-0.17,"roberta_sentiment":-0.995781064},{"para_id":373,"paragraph":"\" Oh is my helmet a widow's cap, Or my lance a wand of the willow-tree?

James the Fifth, scandalized at the excesses of these Border reivers, made an excursion into their country in 1529, and executed summary justice upon several of the most turbulent and lawless of them, including the famous Johnnie Armstrong, Adam Scott of Tushielaw, and Cockburn of Henderland. The latter was hanged by the king's order, over the gate of his own keep, or tower, while his lady fled to the banks of a mountain stream, called the Henderland Burn, and sat down at the foot of a foaming cataract, to drown, amid the sound of the roaring waters, the noise of the drums that announced the close of her husband's existence. The place where she sat is still shown to the stranger. The author of the Ballad is unknown. It was taken down from recitation, in the Ettrick Forest:-- and is as affecting a ballad as any in the language, abounding with touches of genuine pathos, and most lovely simplicity of sorrow.

In the formidable rising against Henry the Eighth, led originally by Sir Robert Aske, and known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the city was besieged by 8,000 men. They were under the command of Nicholas Musgrave, Thomas Gilly, and others, who appeared as leaders of the movement, after it had been abandoned by Aske and its other originators. The citizens, knowing that the Duke of Norfolk was marching to their relief, sailed out upon their besiegers, and put them to flight. Seventy of the leaders were captured by the Duke; but Musgrave, the prime mover, escaped. The others were hanged and beheaded, and their heads placed upon the gates of the city. This happened in the year 1537. Little more than a century afterwards, Carlisle suffered a severer siege by the Scotch and Parliamentary forces, under General Lesley. It was defended for the Royalists by Sir Thomas Glenham; and surrendered on the 28th of June, 1645, after having held out for more than six months. During the siege, the distress of the garrison and the inhabitants was so severe, that the flesh of horses, dogs, rats, and other vermin was eaten. Bread was exhausted and hemp-seed substituted; which in its turn became so dear as to be unpurchasable by all except the most wealthy. A coinage of silver pieces, of three shillings value, was instituted in the castle during the siege, from the plate of the inhabitants which was sent in for the purpose. The diary of Isaac Tullie, a resident in the city during the siege, preserved among the Harleian Mss. in the British Museum, states that\" the citizens were so shrunk from starvation, that they could not choose but laugh at one another, to see their clothes hang upon them as upon men on gibbets, for one might put one's head and fists between the doublets and shirts of many of them.\"","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",38,46],["Carlisle",937,945]],"geonouns":[["towns",192,197],["heads",825,830],["gates",847,852],["forces",1003,1009],["castle",1540,1546],["head",1954,1958]],"pos_words":[["formidable",221,231],["led",265,268],["relief",623,629],["wealthy",1455,1462]],"neg_words":[["suffered",47,55],["calamity",128,136],["suffered",946,954],["siege",965,970],["siege",1192,1197],["distress",1203,1211],["severe",1255,1261],["exhausted",1339,1348],["siege",1558,1563],["siege",1695,1700],["starvation",1805,1815],["hang",1891,1895]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",25,29],["the year 1537",883,896],["a century",915,924],["the 28th of June, 1645",1109,1131],["more than six months",1159,1179]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["against",239,246],["under",384,389],["out",638,641],["under",1011,1016],["out",1151,1154],["among",1712,1717],["between",1969,1976]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0457142857,"vader_sentiment":-0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9741128683},{"para_id":461,"paragraph":"In 1745, Prince Charles Edward Stuart,\" the Young Pretender,\" of the English,\" Bonnie Prince Charlie,\" the darling of the Scotch, the\" Young Chevalier,\" along with the Duke of Perth, and an army of Highlanders, laid siege to Carlisle.

Then the thick fog struck in again, and all the inhabitants of the city expected nothing but a general assault would be made by the rebels, against which the walls were lined with men; and Sir John Pennington, Dr. waugh, chancellor, Humphrey Senhouse, Joseph Dacre Dalston, of Acorn Bank, Esqrs., with several other gentlemen of note, stood all night under arms, to encourage and assist them. The militia was also drawn up at the foot of Castle Street, to be ready, in case of a forcible attack, to relieve and reinforce the men on the walls. On Monday morning, the fog, still continuing thick, the garrison could not observe the situation of the rebels, but heard their pipers playing not far from the English gate. About ten o'clock a man was let down from the city walls, to reconnoitre the enemy, and he found they were retiring towards Warwick bridge. After noon other spies were likewise detached to observe their motions, and discovered a great number remained about Warwick bridge; but the Pretender, with his guard and attendants, were advanced to Brampton, where they lodged themselves that night; and on Tuesday they lay idle from all action, except feats of rapine and plunder; for they spent the day in hunting and destroying the sheep of Lord Carlisle's tenants, and bearing off the country people's geese and other poultry. They also seized upon all the horses they could lay hands on, without any question relating to value or property; notwithstanding they declare the design of their expedition is to redress grievances and correct abuses. Tuesday night the rebels slept quietly with full bellies. On Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, they displayed the white flag at Warwick bridge-end, to which they were about three hours in repairing. About one o'clock, the Young Pretender, attended by Lord George Murray, the Duke of Perth, and several others, besides those called his guards, came to them; upon which they formed themselves, and began to march again to Carlisle, in the following order. First, two( named hussars) in Highland dresses, and high rough red caps, like pioneers: next followed half a dozen of the chief leaders, followed by a kettle drum; then the Pretender's son, at the head of about one hundred and ten horse, called his guards, two and two a-breast; after these a confused multitude of all sorts of mean people, to the number( as was supposed) of about 6,000. In this order they advanced to the height of Warwick Moor; when they halted about half an hour, and took an attentive view of the city. From thence the foot took the lead, and so marched to Carlisle about three in the afternoon; when they began a fresh assault, and the citizens renewed their fire. On Thursday, it was discovered that the rebels had thrown up a trench, which intimidated the town, and in a consultation it was resolved to capitulate; a deputation was sent to the Pretender at Brampton, and the town and castle delivered up on Friday morning.\"","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Dacre",782,787],["Castle",961,967],["Warwick",1364,1371],["Warwick",1497,1504],["Brampton",1580,1588],["Carlisle's",1780,1790],["Warwick",2213,2220],["George",2341,2347],["Carlisle",2505,2513],["Warwick",2973,2980],["Carlisle",3118,3126],["Brampton",3421,3429]],"geonouns":[["walls",681,686],["foot",953,957],["walls",1059,1064],["gate",1234,1238],["walls",1291,1296],["bridge",1372,1378],["bridge",1505,1511],["country",1820,1827],["bridge",2221,2227],["head",2736,2740],["foot",3080,3084],["town",3320,3324],["town",3439,3443],["castle",3448,3454]],"pos_words":[["encourage",889,898],["ready",982,987],["great",1469,1474],["advanced",1568,1576],["correct",2065,2072],["like",2612,2616],["advanced",2947,2955],["attentive",3036,3045],["lead",3094,3098],["fresh",3175,3180],["renewed",3207,3214]],"neg_words":[["retreat",223,230],["fall",411,415],["struck",542,548],["assault",626,633],["attack",1011,1017],["enemy",1317,1322],["idle",1655,1659],["plunder",1704,1711],["grievances",2050,2060],["abuses",2073,2079],["rough",2596,2601],["confused",2832,2840],["assault",3181,3188],["capitulate",3367,3377]],"events":[],"dates":[["Tuesday",1638,1645],["the day",1728,1735],["Tuesday",2081,2088],["march",2490,2495],["Thursday",3230,3238],["Friday",3471,3477]],"times":[["all night",864,873],["Monday morning",1069,1083],["About ten o'clock",1240,1257],["noon",1386,1390],["that night",1619,1629],["night",2089,2094],["Wednesday morning",2142,2159],["about ten o'clock",2161,2178],["about three hours",2252,2269],["About one o'clock",2284,2301],["about half an hour",3004,3022],["three in the afternoon",3133,3155],["morning",3478,3485]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["near",54,58],["without",1924,1931]],"spa_preps":[["about",417,422],["against",663,670],["under",874,879],["down",1272,1276],["about",1491,1496],["about",2744,2749],["about",2915,2920],["about",3127,3132]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0092592593,"vader_sentiment":-0.72,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9951194525},{"para_id":464,"paragraph":"This victory of the Stuart party was but of short duration and little benefit.

The history of the former has been told in the ballads; the history of the latter will be more easily disposed of. The castle has entirely lost its importance. It stands at the north-west angle of the city and is supposed to be on the site of the old Roman fort. It consists of an outward and inner ward, the walls of the outward ward being nine feet in thickness, and about eighteen in height; those of the inner ward being about twelve feet thick. On the east side, within this ward, is the great square tower, built of reddish stone. Within this ward is a deep well, said to have been made by the Romans. The old portcullis is still to be seen on entering the outer gate. Above it a defaced piece of work represents the arms of Henry the Seventh. The governor's house, now an hospital, stands facing the entrance on the opposite side of the yard. To the left of the governor's house is the armoury, and a range of new buildings appropriated for the residence of the officers. In this fortress Mary Queen of Scots was detained a prisoner, after the fatal battle of Langside, near Glasgow; and here her unfortunate acquaintance commenced with the accomplished Duke of Norfolk, an acquaintance which was the means of leading that distinguished nobleman to the block. Until lately the apartments in which she was lodged, commonly called\" Queen Mary's Tower,\" were shewn to visitors; but on account of the insecure state of the foundation, have been taken down. They were situated at the eastern angle of the building. From the top of the castle, or from the ramparts, the prospect is most beautiful. In the foreground are the meadows washed by the Eden, part of which is insulated by a division of the river. To the westward is the Solway Frith, with the hills of Scotland beyond, surmounted by Criffle, and a chain of hills extending westward as far as the eye can reach; to the east, a rich cultivated plain, bounded by the heights of Northumberland, and to the south, the plains towards Penrith, with Cross Fell and Skiddaw. The cathedral dedicated to\" The Holy and undivided Trinity,\" is situated in the centre of the city, in Castle Street. Pennant says, in his first tour in Scotland, that it was begun in the time of William Rufus, by Walter, who was deputy of those parts; and it may be inferred from what is yet remaining, that the old building, when entire, was a noble and solemn edifice. It is now very imperfect, however; for Cromwell, who had small respect for cathedrals and castles, violated its sanctity, and pulled down part of it to build barracks. He did not, however, destroy all vestiges of the age and character of the structure. There still remain some portions of it which were built in the Saxon period. There remains also a more modern part, built in the reign of Edward the Third. This king had an apartment in the Cathedral, where he sometimes took up his residence during his superintendence of those wars which he carried on against the Scottish nation.","file_id":"1846_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",0,8],["Castle",9,15],["Glasgow",1140,1147],["Eden",1705,1709],["Solway Frith",1789,1801],["Scotland",1821,1829],["Northumberland",1994,2008],["Penrith,",2047,2055],["Cross Fell",2061,2071],["Skiddaw",2076,2083],["Castle",2188,2194],["Scotland",2238,2246]],"geonouns":[["castle",177,183],["walls",367,372],["tower",564,569],["stone",588,593],["gate",727,731],["house",823,828],["entrance",865,873],["house",938,943],["buildings",979,988],["residence",1010,1019],["building",1565,1573],["top",1584,1587],["castle",1595,1601],["meadows",1683,1690],["river",1759,1764],["hills",1812,1817],["hills",1876,1881],["building",2402,2410],["castles",2547,2554],["residence",2942,2951]],"pos_words":[["merit",34,39],["great",551,556],["well",622,626],["work",761,765],["accomplished",1206,1218],["leading",1275,1282],["distinguished",1288,1301],["beautiful",1646,1655],["rich",1945,1949],["dedicated",2099,2108],["noble",2431,2436],["respect",2520,2527],["modern",2813,2819]],"neg_words":[["lost",197,201],["prisoner",1089,1097],["fatal",1109,1114],["unfortunate",1162,1173],["insecure",1462,1470],["solemn",2441,2447],["imperfect",2472,2481],["destroy",2646,2653],["vestiges",2658,2666]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["nine feet",399,408],["about twelve feet",483,500]],"loc_advs":[["within",526,532],["left",915,919],["here",1153,1157],["westward",1773,1781],["westward",1892,1900]],"spa_preps":[["about",427,432],["opposite",881,889],["near",1135,1139],["down",1512,1516],["beyond",1830,1836],["down",2590,2594],["against",3013,3020]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0153846154,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9974495769},{"para_id":469,"paragraph":"The present edifice consists of the east limit of the cross, which forms the chancel, and the cross aisle or transept, with the tower; the greater part of the west limb of the cross being that which Cromwell pulled down in 1641.
