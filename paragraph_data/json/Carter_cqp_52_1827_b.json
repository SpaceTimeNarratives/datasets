Our little bark, on reaching a point where the winds and waves came up from the south reach, unbroken by interposing islands, was tossed by heavy swells like the billows of the ocean. Landing at the ferry-house, and pursuing our way to a charming little cottage closely embowered in woods and half hidden by flowers still in bloom, we were conducted by a female along a winding path over-arched by trees, and beaten on one side by the surges of the lake, to a building which goes by the local name of the\" First Station.\" It is a kind of Lodge, erected at the expense of Mr. Curwen, Member of Parliament, and the proprietor of Belle Isle, the largest island in Windermere, on which is his summer residence. The edifice is of stone, standing far up the side of Furness Fell, at the base of impending cliffs, partly concealed by hanging woods. Its location is such, as to command a view from the windows of the second story, of nearly the whole lake, with its islands and the surrounding hills. Nothing can be finer than a peep from this retreat at such an expanse of water, spreading beyond a foreground of woods covering the declivity, and bounded on all sides by the most picturesque mountain scenery. The principal apartment in the building is of an odd shape, being adapted to the uses of an observatory. It has three large windows in projecting alcoves, looking in different directions. A part of the glass is stained with different colours, for the purpose of imparting fanciful hues to the landscape: and the panes possess the magical powers of the kaleidoscope. The blue changes the aspect of the scene into a wintery prospect, while the green at the bleakest season can restore the verdure of summer. Mr. Curwen frequently gives dinner and tea-parties at the Lodge, which nature and art both conspire to render a charming retreat.","file_id":"1827_b","plnames":[["Belle Isle",1020,1030],["Windermere",1054,1064],["Furness",1153,1160]],"geonouns":[["boat",252,256],["lake",297,301],["water",386,391],["point",424,429],["islands",510,517],["ferry",592,597],["house",598,603],["cottage",647,654],["woods",676,681],["winding",763,770],["path",771,775],["trees",791,796],["lake",842,846],["building",853,861],["island",1044,1050],["residence",1089,1098],["stone",1118,1123],["woods",1228,1233],["lake",1336,1340],["islands",1351,1358],["hills",1379,1384],["water",1459,1464],["woods",1499,1504],["mountain",1578,1586],["building",1627,1635],["landscape",1889,1898]],"pos_words":[["eminence",20,28],["like",546,550],["charming",631,639],["bloom",718,723],["finer",1401,1406],["picturesque",1566,1577],["magical",1926,1933],["charming",2214,2222]],"neg_words":[["impending",1182,1191],["retreat",1429,1436],["odd",1645,1648],["fanciful",1868,1876],["conspire",2193,2201],["retreat",2223,2230]],"events":[["the\" First Station",894,912]],"dates":[["summer",1082,1088],["season",2060,2066],["summer",2094,2100]],"times":[["the next morning",120,136]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",1476,1482]],"spa_preps":[["under",177,182],["opposite",276,284],["along",755,760],["over",776,780],["into",2003,2007]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0100502513,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9971213937},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"A squall overtook us on our return to the ferry, and compelled us to seek shelter in a large and commodious hotel near the water.

Our appetites, however, were less proof against the calls of hunger; and a ride of several miles, after an abstinence of as many hours, began to awaken a regret, that the hospitality of the Cottage had been declined. There was no tavern in all this region; and the only alternative was starvation, or intrusion upon a private family. The latter was of course preferred; and observing an old lady with a little girl by her side feasting upon an apple-pie at the door of a thatch, we solicited the favour of participating in the repast. Our plea was not in vain. After many apologies, that the fare was too coarse to be offered to strangers, the good woman was persuaded to cut each of us a liberal piece, and add the luxury of a glass of small beer. So riding up to the cottage door,( for the interior was scarcely large enough to admit three additional inmates,) we received the bounty from her hands, without the trouble of dismounting from our ponies, giving her many thanks with a compensation proportionate to our feelings of gratitude for the favour.

But it did not require the authority of a man of so much taste, to render us susceptible to the charms of such scenery. Nature has here wantoned in the richness of the landscape, and left no feature unfinished. All that hills, valleys, woods, and waters, in their sweetest and most delicate combinations can effect challenges the admiration of the spectator. Before him stretches a vale many miles in extent, surrounded on all sides by mountains, the highest of which is about three thousand feet. Four or five narrow passes open into the valley from different quarters, up which the eye travels till it is lost among the hills. On one side, Derwent Water, of a circular form, and its bosom studded with several wooded islands, slumbers at the bases of the mountains, between Newlands and Borrowdale.

Between this bristled region and the foot of Skiddaw, the vale of Keswick is seen beautifully embosomed, with its lakes and streams reduced to a diminutive size. Such are the mere outlines of this view, which amply remunerated us for the fatigues of the ascent.","file_id":"1827_b","plnames":[["Skiddaw",225,232],["Skiddaw",695,702],["Solway Frith",794,806],["Carlisle",832,840],["Ingleborough",933,945],["Yorkshire",964,973],["Westmoreland",978,990],["Penrith",1009,1016],["Ullswater",1048,1057],["Irish Sea",1081,1090],["Skiddaw",1477,1484],["Keswick",1498,1505]],"geonouns":[["stones",106,112],["mountains",116,125],["top",218,221],["brow",315,319],["horizon",396,403],["country",485,492],["hills",637,642],["towns",742,747],["villages",752,760],["peak",925,929],["town",1001,1005],["foot",1040,1044],["coast",1106,1111],["rocks",1137,1142],["ports",1170,1175],["mountains",1331,1340],["peaks",1362,1367],["heads",1382,1387],["region",1454,1460],["foot",1469,1473],["vale",1490,1494],["lakes",1546,1551],["streams",1556,1563],["mere",1607,1611]],"pos_words":[["terrific",278,286],["agreeable",337,346],["bright",776,782],["prettily",1024,1032],["beautifully",1514,1525],["amply",1641,1646]],"neg_words":[["tedious",508,515],["chaos",1322,1327],["confusion",1421,1430]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["half an hour",37,49]],"distances":[["sixty or eighty miles",412,433]],"loc_advs":[["above",1392,1397]],"spa_preps":[["through",155,162],["round",388,393],["within",566,572],["between",665,672],["along",1098,1103]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0192307692,"vader_sentiment":0.85,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9994729161},{"para_id":79,"paragraph":"Our return from Skiddaw was in season to comply with the terms of the Laureate's invitation to tea, and to enjoy the high satisfaction of seeing one of the most eminent as well as the most voluminious of the living poets, whose Joan of Arc and Madock were among my earliest readings, and whose latest production has been the companion of our rambles through England.
