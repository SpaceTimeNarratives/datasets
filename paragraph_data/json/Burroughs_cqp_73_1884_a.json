All cultivated men delight in Shakespeare; he is the universal genius; but Wordsworth's poetry has more the character of a message, and a message special and personal, to a comparatively small circle of readers. He stands for a particular phase of human thought and experience, and his service to certain minds is like an initiation to a new order of truths. Note what a revelation he was to the mind of John Stewart Mill. His limitations make him all the more private and precious, like the seclusion of one of his mountain dales. He is not and can never be the world's poet, but more especially the poet of those who love solitude and solitary communion with nature. Shakespeare's attitude toward nature is for the most part like that of a gay, careless reveler, who leaves his companions for a moment to pluck a flower or gather a shell here and there, as they stroll","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",57,67],["Wordsworth",144,154]],"geonouns":[["mountain",585,593],["dales",594,599]],"pos_words":[["delight",88,95],["genius",132,138],["like",383,387],["revelation",440,450],["precious",542,550],["like",552,556],["love",688,692],["like",796,800]],"neg_words":[["limitations",496,507],["careless",816,824]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",909,913],["there",918,923]],"spa_preps":[["toward",761,767]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0731707317,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987462759},{"para_id":2,"paragraph":"\" By paved fountain, or by rushy brook, Or on the beach\u00e9d margent of the sea.\"","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["brook",33,38],["sea",73,76]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9960607886},{"para_id":3,"paragraph":"He is, of course, preeminent in all purely poetic achievements, but his poems can never minister to the spirit in the way Wordsworth's do.","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",122,132]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["preeminent",18,28],["poetic",43,49],["achievements",50,62]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.25,"vader_sentiment":0.26,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9826227427},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"One can hardly appreciate the extent to which the latter poet has absorbed and reproduced the spirit of the Westmoreland scenery until he has visited that region.

Amid so much that is steep and rugged and broken, the eye delights in the repose and equilibrium of horizontal lines, - a bit of table-land, the surface of the lake, or the level of the valley bottom. The principal valleys over our own Catskill region all have this stately floor, so characteristic of Wordsworth's country. It was a pleasure which I daily indulged in to stand on the bridge by Grasmere Church, with that full, limpid stream before me, pausing and deepening under the stone embankment near where the dust of the poet lies, and let the eye sweep across the plain to the foot of the near mountains, or dwell upon their encircling summits above the tops of the trees and the roofs of the village. The water-ouzel loved to linger there, too, and would sit in contemplative mood on the stones around which the water loitered and murmured, its clear white alone defining it from the object upon which it rested. Then t would trip along the margin of the pool, to flit a few feet over its surface, and suddenly, as if it had burst like a bubble, vanish before my eyes; there would be a little splash of the water beneath where I saw it, as if the drop of which it was composed had reunited with the surface there. Then, in a moment or two, it would emerge from the water and take up its stand as dry and unruffled as ever. It was always amusing to see this plump little bird, so unlike a water-fowl in shape and manner, disappear in the stream. It did not seem to dive, but simply dropped into the water, as if its wings had suddenly failed it. Sometimes it fairly tumbled in from its perch. It was gone from sight in a twinkling, and, while you were wondering how it could accomplish the feat of walking on the bottom of the stream under there, it reappeared as unconcerned as possible. It is a song-bird, a thrush, and gives a feature to these mountain streams and waterfalls which ours, except on the Pacific coast, entirely lack. The stream that winds through Grasmere vale, and flows against the embankment of the churchyard, as the Avon at Stratford, is of great beauty, - clean, bright, full, trouty, with just a tinge of gypsy blood in its veins, which it gets from the black tarns on the mountains, and which adds to its richness of color. I saw an angler take a few trout from it, in a meadow near the village. After a heavy rain the stream was not roily, but slightly darker in hue; these fields and mountains are so turf-bound that no particle of soil is carried away by the water.","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[["Grasmere",117,125],["North Wales",162,173],["Wordsworth",585,595],["Grasmere",677,685],["Grasmere",2256,2264]],"geonouns":[["valley",83,89],["mountains",204,213],["valleys",253,260],["lines",394,399],["table",412,417],["land",418,422],["lake",443,447],["valley",469,475],["valleys",498,505],["region",528,534],["country",598,605],["bridge",667,673],["stream",717,723],["stone",767,772],["foot",868,872],["mountains",885,894],["summits",927,934],["trees",957,962],["village",984,991],["water",997,1002],["stones",1080,1086],["water",1104,1109],["water",1399,1404],["water",1557,1562],["water",1680,1685],["stream",1729,1735],["water",1790,1795],["stream",2018,2024],["mountain",2138,2146],["streams",2147,2154],["waterfalls",2159,2169],["coast",2204,2209],["stream",2230,2236],["vale",2265,2269],["mountains",2489,2498],["meadow",2588,2594],["village",2604,2611],["stream",2636,2642],["fields",2692,2698],["mountains",2703,2712],["water",2779,2784]],"pos_words":[["doubtless",6,15],["like",61,65],["impressive",131,141],["stately",549,556],["pleasure",616,624],["tops",945,949],["loved",1009,1014],["clear",1137,1142],["like",1323,1327],["amusing",1629,1636],["fairly",1850,1856],["accomplish",1966,1976],["feat",1981,1985],["great",2355,2360],["beauty",2361,2367],["clean",2371,2376],["bright",2378,2384],["richness",2522,2530]],"neg_words":[["steep",304,309],["broken",325,331],["dust",799,803],["lies",816,820],["object",1176,1182],["failed",1826,1832],["tumbled",1857,1864],["lack",2220,2224],["darker",2671,2677]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",633,638]],"times":[],"distances":[["a few feet",1261,1271]],"loc_advs":[["above",935,940],["there",1025,1030],["there",1361,1366],["there",1499,1504],["there",2031,2036],["near",2595,2599],["away",2767,2771]],"spa_preps":[["over",506,510],["under",757,762],["near",784,788],["across",844,850],["near",880,884],["around",1087,1093],["along",1223,1228],["over",1272,1276],["beneath",1405,1412],["into",1781,1785],["under",2025,2030],["through",2248,2255],["against",2281,2288]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0387931034,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9989136457},{"para_id":10,"paragraph":"Falls and cascades are a great feature all through this country, as they are a marked feature in Wordsworth's poetry.

I followed the highway a mile or more beyond the Swan Inn, and then I committed myself to a footpath that turns up the mountainside to the right, and crossed into Grisedale and so to Ulleswater. Two schoolgirls whom I overtook put me on the right track. The voice of a foaming mountain torrent was in my ears a long distance, and now and then the path crossed it. Fairfield Mountain was on my right hand, Helm Crag and Dunmail Raise on my left. Grasmere plain soon lay far below. The haymakers, encouraged by a gleam of sunshine, were hastily raking together the rain-blackened hay. From my outlook they appeared to be slowly and laboriously rolling up a great sheet of dark brown paper, uncovering beneath it one of the most fresh and vivid green. The mown grass is so long in curing in this country( frequently two weeks) that the new blades spring beneath it, and a second crop is well under way before the old is\" carried.\" The long mountain slopes up which I was making my way were as verdant as the plain below me. Large coarse ferns or bracken, with an underlining of fine grass, covered the ground on the lower portions. On the higher, grass alone prevailed. On the top of the divide, looking down into the valley of Ulleswater, I came upon one of those black tarns, or mountain lakelets, which are such a feature in this strange scenery. The word\" tarn\" has no meaning with us, though our young poets sometimes use it as they do this Yorkshire word\" wold;\" one they get from Wordsworth, the other from Tennyson. But when you have seen one of those still, inky pools at the head of a silent, lonely Westmoreland dale, you will not be apt to misapply the word in future. Suddenly the serene shepherd mountain opens this black, gleaming eye at your feet, and it is all the more weird for having no eyebrow of rocks, or fringe of rush or bush. The steep, encircling slopes drop down and hem it about with the most green and uniform turf. If its rim had been modeled by human hands, it could not have been more regular or gentle in outline. Beneath its emerald coat the soil is black and peaty, which accounts for the hue of the water and the dark line that encircles it.","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[["Helvellyn",117,126],["Grisedale",291,300],["Ulleswater",311,321],["Fairfield",492,501],["Helm Crag",533,542],["Dunmail Raise",547,560],["Grasmere",573,581],["Ulleswater",1353,1363],["Yorkshire",1571,1580],["Wordsworth",1612,1622],["Westmoreland",1735,1747]],"geonouns":[["top",110,113],["track",375,380],["mountain",405,413],["path",475,479],["country",921,928],["mountain",1065,1073],["slopes",1074,1080],["ground",1227,1233],["top",1302,1305],["valley",1343,1349],["mountain",1406,1414],["tarn",1485,1489],["head",1710,1714],["dale",1748,1752],["mountain",1835,1843],["feet",1883,1887],["rocks",1943,1948],["slopes",1999,2005],["water",2261,2266],["line",2280,2284]],"pos_words":[["better",53,59],["soft",67,71],["right",267,272],["overtook",346,354],["right",369,374],["right",521,526],["great",783,788],["fresh",854,859],["vivid",864,869],["well",1012,1016],["fine",1203,1207],["silent",1720,1726],["serene",1819,1825],["gentle",2154,2160]],"neg_words":[["torrent",414,421],["hastily",663,670],["slowly",747,753],["dark",798,802],["coarse",1155,1161],["strange",1458,1465],["lonely",1728,1734],["weird",1912,1917],["steep",1981,1986],["dark",2275,2279]],"events":[["the Swan Inn",173,185]],"dates":[["two weeks",941,950],["spring",972,978]],"times":[["One afternoon",0,13]],"distances":[["a mile",151,157]],"loc_advs":[["left",567,571],["together",678,686]],"spa_preps":[["out",90,93],["beyond",166,172],["into",286,290],["below",601,606],["beneath",827,834],["beneath",979,986],["under",1017,1022],["below",1139,1144],["down",1329,1333],["into",1334,1338],["down",2011,2015],["about",2027,2032]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0186046512,"vader_sentiment":0.81,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977552295},{"para_id":23,"paragraph":"\" All round this pool both flocks and herd might drink On its firm margin, even as from a well, Or some stone basin, which the herdsman's hand Had shaped for their refreshment.\"","file_id":"1884_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["stone",104,109]],"pos_words":[["well",90,94]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["round",6,11]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0526315789,"vader_sentiment":0.65,"roberta_sentiment":0.998316288},{"para_id":24,"paragraph":"The path led across the outlet of the tarn, and then divided, one branch going down into the head of Grisedale, and the other mounting up the steep flank of Helvellyn.

On the more precipitous sides the grass and moss are lodged, and hold like snow, and are as tender in hue as the first April blades. A multitude of lakes are in view, and Morecambe Bay to the south.
