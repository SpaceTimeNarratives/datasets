Its picturesquely-irregular shores are full of varied charms-soft secluded vales, and green nooks of nestling-old towns and villages, rich parks, and wildwoods sloping to the water-which are all the more charming that they cling like a garland about this playground of the capricious sea, with the outlines of the mountains crowding round in the rearward, tier over tier, in stormy majesty. Within the fine sweep of scenery overlooking this bay, there is many a venerable home of ancient religion, many a towered steep and storied glen, that wakes the memories of a thousand years gone by. Morecambe is, also, the outfall of Windermere and Coniston waters, and is the most impressive gateway to the Lake Country. From its shores at Ulverstone, the River Leven will lead the traveller by windings full of changeful beauty, nine miles, to that pleasant resting-place called\" Newby Bridge,\" at the foot of Windermere. Cartmel and Furness have been compartively unknown, on account of difficulty of access in days gone by; but now that the line from Lancaster to Ulverstone skirts these sequestered regions, their attractions cannot fail to arrest the attention of all lovers of the picturesque in nature. In addition to its natural beauty, Furness is indeed\" a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass;\" but the wild fells and green valleys of Cartmel knowlittle of the bustling world, save what belongs to their purely agricultural and pastoral character; and the primitive race of mountain folk dwelling therein clings tothe manners, language, and traditions of its\" fore-elders\" with an affection little disturbed by communion with the great changes of modern life.

The channels are constantly shifting, particularly after heavyrains, when they are perilously uncertain. For many centuries past, two guides have conducted travellers over them. Their duty is to observe the changes, and find fordable points. In all seasons and states of the weather this was their duty, and in times of storm and fog it must have been fraught with danger. These guides wereanciently appointed by the Prior of Cartmel, and received synodal and Peter Pence for their maintance. They are now paid from the revenues of the duchy. This office ofguide has been so long held by a family of the name of Carter, that the country people have given that name to the office itself. A gentleman, crossing from Lancaster, once asked the guide if\" Carters\" were never lost on the sands. \" I never knew any lost,\" said the guide;\" there's one or two drowned now and then, but theyere generally foundsomewhere i' th bed when the tide goes out.\" A certain ancient mariner, called Nuttall, who lives at Grange, on the Cartmel shore, told me that\" people who get their livingby' following the sands,' hardly ever die in their beds. They end their days on the sands; and even their horses and carts are generally lost there. I have helped,\" said he,\" to pull horses and coaches, ay, and guides too, out of the sands. The channel,\" he continued,\" is seldom two days together in one place. You may make a chart one day, and, before the ink is dry, it will have shifted.\" I found, indeed, byinquiry, that those who have travelled the sands longest, are always most afraid of them; and that these silent currents, which shimmer so beautifully in the sunshine, have been\" the ribs of death\" to thousands. The old\" Over Sands\" route began at Hest Bank, a cliff on the shore, about three miles from Lancaster. The coach, and whatevertravellers might be going, used to meet the guide on the banks of the River Keer, which runs over the sands, about three miles from Hest Bank. Here the guide carefullytried the bed of the stream before travellers were allowed to cross - for what was fordable yesterday to-day might be a quicksand. The safe tracks are indicated by branches of furze, called\" brogs,\" stuck in the sand. The old word\" brog,\" means a broken branch; and it is very likely that the word\" brob,\" applied by the people ofFurness and Cartmel to these furze branches, is merely a corruption of the former word. On reaching Kent's Bank, the coach went about three miles through the villages onthe Cartmel shore, and then forward across the Leven estuary, to Ulverstone town. These sands, though not one - third the distance of the sands between Lancaster and Kent' sBank, are considered much more dangerous. Probably the difference may arise from the greater number of persons crossing from Cartmel to Ulverstone. In every village, andin almost every house I entered, upon the shores of this bay, I met with tales of danger and disaster which have occurred upon these sands; and, even now, there is a kindof daily excitement there, arising from the dangerous possibilities of travelling over them. Such was the old\" Over Sands\" route from Lancaster. In Mrs. Hemans' letters, she thus alludes to the journey: -\" I must not omit to tell you that Mr. Wordsworth not only admired our exploit in crossing the Ulverstone sandds as a deed of' derringdo,' but as a decided proof of taste. The lake scenery, he says, is never seen to such advantage as after the passage of what he calls its majestic barrier.\"","file_id":"1860_a","plnames":[["Lancaster",67,76],["Ulverstone",80,90],["Cartmel",698,705],["Lancaster",986,995],["Grange",1273,1279],["Cartmel",1288,1295],["Lancaster",2060,2069],["River",2164,2169],["Cartmel",2603,2610],["Kent",2691,2695],["Cartmel",2764,2771],["Leven",2807,2812],["Ulverstone",2825,2835],["Lancaster",2912,2921],["Kent",2926,2930],["Cartmel",3058,3065],["Ulverstone",3069,3079],["Lancaster",3406,3415],["Wordsworth",3515,3525],["Ulverstone",3571,3581]],"geonouns":[["railway",11,18],["sands",56,61],["channels",276,284],["points",506,512],["country",901,908],["sands",1054,1059],["bed",1188,1191],["shore",1296,1301],["sands",1362,1367],["beds",1395,1399],["sands",1428,1433],["coaches",1538,1545],["sands",1578,1583],["channel",1589,1596],["sands",1799,1804],["shore",2030,2035],["coach",2075,2080],["banks",2151,2156],["sands",2196,2201],["bed",2271,2274],["stream",2282,2288],["tracks",2401,2407],["coach",2708,2713],["villages",2749,2757],["shore",2772,2777],["estuary",2813,2820],["town",2836,2840],["sands",2848,2853],["sands",2898,2903],["village",3090,3097],["house",3118,3123],["shores",3144,3150],["bay",3159,3162],["sands",3235,3240],["lake",3652,3656]],"pos_words":[["striking",111,119],["helped",1500,1506],["silent",1861,1867],["beautifully",1895,1906],["safe",2396,2400],["excitement",3281,3291],["advantage",3697,3706],["majestic",3749,3757]],"neg_words":[["danger",181,187],["perilously",355,365],["uncertain",366,375],["fraught",624,631],["danger",637,643],["lost",1042,1046],["lost",1080,1084],["die",1382,1385],["lost",1481,1485],["afraid",1830,1836],["shimmer",1884,1891],["death",1947,1952],["stuck",2460,2465],["broken",2508,2514],["corruption",2648,2658],["dangerous",2964,2973],["danger",3184,3190],["disaster",3195,3203],["dangerous",3316,3325],["omit",3489,3493],["exploit",3547,3554]],"events":[],"dates":[["many centuries",381,395],["all seasons",517,528],["their days",1410,1420],["two days",1624,1632],["one day",1677,1684],["yesterday",2353,2362],["to-day",2363,2369],["daily",3275,3280]],"times":[],"distances":[["about three miles",2037,2054],["about three miles",2203,2220],["about three miles",2719,2736]],"loc_advs":[["past",396,400],["there",1104,1109],["there",1486,1491],["forward",2788,2795],["there",3257,3262],["there",3292,3297]],"spa_preps":[["over",439,443],["out",1211,1214],["out",1567,1570],["together",1633,1641],["over",2187,2191],["through",2737,2744],["across",2796,2802],["between",2904,2911],["over",3354,3358]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0361111111,"vader_sentiment":-0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966186285},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"This impressive scene may now be traversed by all who prefer speed and ease to danger and delay free from the uncertainties of the old route.

In the northward distance there is a fine view of the Cumberland hills at this point. Delightful Arnside! If any man loves the beautiful in nature-if he be a geologist, or a botanist, or an invalid in search of peaceful restoration-let him wander about Arnside, and pleasant Silverdale Which is close by. Shortly after this evening ride I returned for a ramble about Arnside, one sunny day, in company with Mr. W. Salmon, president of the Horticultural Society of Ulverstone, and Mr. Bolton, of Swartmoor, a notable geologist, and a personal\" friend and fellow-labourarer\" of Professor SedgwickThe day was so fine, and the scene so beautiful, that we were as blithe as threc lads going a-nutting to the woods on a holiday morning in summer time. The old station-masterat Arnside kenw the names of the hills around, and every remarkable point of the glorious landscape. We chatted with him a few minutes, watching the beautiful effect of a cloud-shadow gliding over the grand limestone crags of\" Whitbarrow\" in the sunlight; and, after beggin a few matches, we lit our cigars, and took up a shady lane towards thepicturesque hill called\" Arnside Knot.\" Having wound up this pleasant lane, between tall bushy hedgerows, about half a mile, we met the gamekeeper, who gave me directions forthe ascent of the\" Knot,\" warning us to carefully against the use of fire, by which considerable damage had been done in the woods above. Skirting the eastern slope of the hill, a good road brought us into the vale at the head of which\" Arnside Tower,\" a massive old quadrangular building, of limestone, stands, a lonesome, gloomy-looking ruin. It isfinely situated on an isthmus which connects the two peninsulas of Arnside and Silverdale. Seawad, it commands a view of Warton Sands, and looks right over the bay, out to Peel Castle, off the far western point of Low Furness. Eastward, it overlooks the lone green vale of Arnside, with its little tarn shining in the hollow, and beyond there is a viewof Farleton Knot, and of the sands formed by the River Kier. The walls of this ancient border stronghold are of great thickness, and the small rude windows, doorways, shot-holes, and quaint fireplaces are still visible. There are no evidences of any other ancient outbuildings or defences connected with it, and, probably, as Dr. Whittaker says,\" It has beenmerely a place of temporary retreat, in case of sudden alarm from the north, for the neighbouring inhabitants.\" With the exception of an old farmhouse, a little below the tower, there is no other building in all the vale of Arnside. The old name of the township was\" Earnseat,\" from the\" earn,\" for which it was a favourite retreat in ancient times. Thedistrict, especially about the\" Knot,\" is famous for rare ferns, and the northern shore of that rocky beight is a favourite wandering ground of the geologist. Leaving the road onthe slope of\" Arnside Knot,\" we walked through the old farm-yard below, and thence up to the tower. Within, all was ruined, and wild, and roofless, but we found the ancient windinglimestone staircase sufficiently good for us to get to the top without difficulty. Here we sat down on the broad, grass-grown, ruined wall, to look about us. In spite of thebeauty of the woods on\" Arnside Knot,\" the greenness of the vale, and the fine views east and west, there was a touch of desolation in the scene, to which the mouldering tower wesat upon contributed a solemn share. In the east a train, laden with Furness ore, darted by the end of the vale, and broke the dreamy stillness with remembrances of the activeworld. It passed, and all was still again, except where a number of swallows skimmed the air in graceful flights between our ruined resting-place and the ground. I chanced to fling some shreds of paper fromthe tower, which, as they were borne away in quivering gyrations by the wind, were instantly pursued by the birds, and rarely reached the ground before they were caught by one orother of these dainty ariels, and carried off to nooks in the caves of the old farmhouse below. One of my friends said it reminded him of the pursuit of knowledge under dfficulties, and was another evidence of the growing taste for reading in these times. Another suggested thhat perhaps these Arnside swallows might inherit the souls of departed politicians, andwere anxious to know something of the political movements of the day; and, pointing to a day bird which dropped the shred he had caught in his bill, he said that one evidently did n't agree with the leading article, and therefore declined to take the paper in any further. Another thought they might have heard of the dispute about the duty, or might be in some wayinterested in the consumption of the article. But rumblings of distant thunder warned us that we had far to go, so we came down the stairs of the ruined tower, and began the ascent of\" Arnside Knot.\" A good footpath leads aslant the hill, through groves of larch, spruce, and fir, whose different hues of green look very beautiful in the sunshine. Abot half the way we left the footpath, and struck up the shingly bill-side to save time. The slope was steeper than any ordinary proof, and the shingles gave way at every step; but we toiled up, oftenusing our hands, till we reached a green spot at the edge of the wood upon the summit. Here, among gorse bushes and tufts of ling, we found it very pleasant to rest. The view was finefrom this point. At the foot of the hill lay the lone vale of Arnside, with its hoary tower standing solitarily at the head, like a worn out soldier dreaming of departed wars-and its silvery pool shining in the green hollow, the little bright eye of the silent dell. Over the fir-clad ridge beyond we had a charming glimpse of Silverdale, and its pretty sequesteredvillage near the sea. I understand that the sands on Silverdale shore are very fine for bathing. In this delightful dale there is a small lake called\" Hawes Tarn,\" crowded with pike, and remarkable for its thick bed of snow-white, tiny, univalve sea shells, of fragile beauty. The waters of this tarn are said to be affected by the rise and fall of the tide. The sunwas shining all around, and we had a full view of\" Farleton Knot,\" and the picturesque limestone bridges running eastward. In a far corner of the milnthorpe Sands, the white tower of Heversham church peeped out prettily from the green woods down by the shore; whilst in the east all the great Yorkshire hills were robed in gloom, and solemn rollings of distant thundertold that a storm was raging among them. It was a glorious sight; but cool gusts came now and then through the sunshine, and the trees on\" Arnside Knot\" began to talk of the comingtempest. Our old friend said that rain would certainly overtake us before the day had run by, and as a fir tree was but a riddly shelter in heavy showers, we had better go nearer the haunts of man. He pocketed hisgeological hammer, slung his strong wallet over his shoulder, and led on through scratchy brushwood, under the green shades that cover all the hill top, emerging on the open northernslope, from whence the view of\" Whitbarrow,\" the shores and sands channel of the Kent, and the distant mountains of Cumberland, is wonderfully fine. Descending to the water side, ourold friend donned his spectacles, and took out his hammer again; and the two geologists wandered about the rocky shore in a trance of scientific delight, picking up many specimensinteresting to them. One of these specimens-I was requested to show to an eminent geologist in Manchester, whose name was familiar to them. We found some simple, substantial cheer at a little country inn, called the\" Fighting Cocks,\" near the river side. From this place we wend westward a mile or so, then up the valley of the Winster to\" Castle Head,\" where we spent two pleasant hours in the house and grounds. From this place we went westward a mile or so, then up the valley of the Winster to\" Castle Head,\" where we spent two pleasant hours in thehouse and grounds. From thence we crossed over\" Aggerslack,\" down into\" Lindal Lane,\" then up the opposite steep again, by the way of\" Slack Farm,\" right over the rocky summit of\" Hampsfield Fell,\" descending into the old town of Cartmel, where we took tea at the Cavendish Arms,\" the principal inn, which stands on the site of the ancient priory buildings nearthe church. A seven mile walk in the gloaming through Cartmel park, by the woods of Holker, and partly over the Leven Sands, brought us to Ulverstone about ten at night, after twentymiles walk, just in time to get well wet by the storm which we had watched in the forenoon from the eastern edge of\" Arnside Knot.\" In spite of this, I hardly ever had a more delightfulramble through a more finely-varied country than the one I had that day. After this passing notice of my excursion to Arnside, I will now return to my first ride to Ulverstone by rail.","file_id":"1860_a","plnames":[["Arnside",46,53],["Arnside",76,83],["Cumberland",223,233],["Arnside",266,273],["Arnside",422,429],["Silverdale",444,454],["Arnside",536,543],["Ulverstone",633,643],["Bolton",653,659],["Arnside",940,947],["Whitbarrow",1164,1174],["Arnside",1306,1313],["Arnside",1692,1699],["Arnside",1872,1879],["Silverdale",1884,1894],["Warton",1926,1932],["Peel",1977,1981],["Castle",1982,1988],["Furness",2023,2030],["Arnside",2078,2085],["Farleton

About sixty years ago may curious articles were foundthere, among which were parts of human skull, vertebre,&amp; c., teeth of buffaloes, tusks of boar, pieces of limestone, resembling ben's eggs; rings of blue rag-stone, lead, clay, and glass; ninety - fivesticas of Northumbrian kings, seventy - five Roman coins, a stone, supposed to have been a mould for casting silver rings; iron ore, petrified bone, pebbles, impressions of clay, pottery, or bone, and other ancient relics.

Leaving\" Aad Billy\" at the end of\" Over Bogie,\" my friend proposed that we should go to the top of\" Yewbarrow,\" the hill at the rear of the village, from the summit of which he said the views were magnificent. As we went out at the head of the village by a shady road, he opened the gate of a small enclosed knoll, on the right hand, saying,\" Stop, my workshop is in here. We'll peep at it, if you like, before we go up.\" In the centre of this enclosure there was a rude, round hut, built of limestone, something like a large summer-house. On entering, I found myself in a little museum, filled with strange birds, and carefully arranged glass cases of rear shells andinsects. Against the wall hung a broken skeleton head and horns of the Irish elk, which had been found in the neighbouring sands, a few years ago. In one corner was reareda large slab of red standstone, from Storton, in Cheshire, on which were plainly imprinted the footsteps of some antediluvian creature; he thought it was the plesiasaurus. The place was full of curiosities; and I noticed a live wood owl, in a cage outside, with its large, lustrous eyes, blinking in the sunshine. Leaving this little sanctum ofscience, we went through the shady grounds of\" Yewbarrow Lodge,\" and thence, by rocky, sinuous paths to the summit of\" Yewbarrow.\" This hill takes its name from the yewtree, for the growth of which it is remarkable, and from\" barrow,\" a cairn or burial place. Here I was glad to sit down and look round, for I was out of wind, and the view hadgrown grander as we rose. Morecambe and a great extent of its shores were full in sight, the slopes and lowlands all beauty and fertility, all above and in the distance wild and majestic. My friend told me that, on a favourable day, the town of Lancaster was almost as distinctly in sight as the houses at the foot of the hill; but he surprisedme more by saying that the great, ivy clad, lime-stone rocks upon the summit of\" Yewbarrow,\" were unmistakably waterworn, that is, worn by the action of the sea. The villagelay under the eye, as clearly as a map or model on a table. We could see all its houses, perching or nestling in picturesque confusion, among straggling gardens and bloomynooks. We could see all its mansions, with their rich grounds, and woods now spreading out the bright green of spring in the sunshine; its white roads and bye lanes, windingthrough orchards, and under over-lapping trees, about the green knolls and dingles, and lacing the land with lines of ever-varying loveliness. Grange is no less pleasantin its own quiet beauty, and in the scenery about it, than in the salubrity of its climate, which is said to rival that of the southern coast of England.

Of course, there is a tradition connectedwith the foundation of Cartmel Priory. It seems that a nearly seven hundred years ago, a number of foreign monks, wandering about the country in search of a settlement, somehow found their way into this, then, dense forest wild. They were preparing to build their church upon a hill-top in the neighbourhood, when a voice spoke to them outof the air, saying:\" Not there; but in a valley between two rivers, where the one runs north and the other south.\" It seems unfortunate that the voice should neglect tothem where that valley was, as they happened to be so near at the time. But it was so; for these homeless fathers wandered, after that, all over the north of England, infruitless search, until they found the place, at last, near the very hill where they first heard\" the voice in the air.\" Here, on an island of hard ground between thesesingular streams, they build the Priory of Cartmel, and dedicated it to St. Mary. They also built a small chapel on the hill, where they heard the voice, and they dedicatedit to St. Bernard. The chapel is now gone, but the hill is called\" St. Bernard's Mount\" to this day.","file_id":"1860_a","plnames":[["Cartmel",8,15],["Grange",120,126],["Lancashire",226,236],["Grange",461,467],["Cartmel",497,504],["Kent",853,857],["Cartmel",909,916],["Cartmel",931,938],["Cuthbert",1056,1064],["Cartmel",2053,2060],["England",2695,2702],["Cartmel",2917,2924],["Mount",3127,3132]],"geonouns":[["market",21,27],["town",28,32],["district",50,58],["hills",152,157],["church",216,222],["parish",347,353],["church",354,360],["church",380,386],["town",431,435],["waters",587,593],["stone",631,636],["district",994,1002],["land",1069,1073],["house",1309,1314],["mouth",1448,1453],["town",1789,1793],["vale",1811,1815],["streams",1831,1838],["church",1869,1875],["tower",1925,1930],["country",2164,2171],["forest",2246,2252],["church",2294,2300],["hill",2308,2312],["top",2313,2316],["valley",2410,2416],["rivers",2429,2435],["valley",2553,2559],["hill",2775,2779],["island",2839,2845],["ground",2854,2860],["streams",2883,2890],["chapel",2980,2986],["hill",2994,2998],["chapel",3069,3075],["hill",3097,3101]],"pos_words":[["pleasant",129,137],["noble",176,181],["well",368,372],["famous",476,482],["great",544,549],["attraction",550,560],["celebrated",598,608],["cure",617,621],["benefit",898,905],["great",958,963],["liberty",1408,1415],["well",1633,1637],["faithful",1774,1782],["fine",1850,1854],["dedicated",2930,2939]],"neg_words":[["dissolution",272,283],["liable",739,745],["infringe",1490,1498],["injure",1525,1531],["curse",1566,1571],["dense",2240,2245],["wild",2253,2257],["unfortunate",2493,2504],["neglect",2527,2534],["hard",2849,2853]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",508,514],["spring",525,531],["the summer months",564,581],["many years",666,676],["annual",818,824],["1188",1108,1112],["hundred years",2098,2111],["this day",3137,3145]],"times":[],"distances":[["more than two miles",91,110],["About theree miles",402,420]],"loc_advs":[["past",677,681],["here",871,875],["there",2000,2005],["there",2394,2399],["between",2417,2424],["near",2591,2595]],"spa_preps":[["over",143,147],["about",441,446],["near",866,870],["within",1951,1957],["about",2154,2159],["into",2223,2227],["over",2677,2681],["near",2761,2765],["between",2861,2868]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0166112957,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986666441},{"para_id":31,"paragraph":"Going from a place like Manchester into this little monastic town is almost like going to bed, or sinking into an antiquarian dream, all in so quaint and quiet.

The town is pleasantly situated in a vale, on theshores of the Leven estuary, among the hills of Low Furness; and it stands at convenient distances from so many points of interest that I took up head quarters at thewell-known Sun Hote, in the market place. From hence I made daily excursions into the neighbourhood; and one of my first rambles was to Swarthmoor, about a mile from thetown. Swarthmoor Hall was, for many years, the residence of George Fox, founder of the Society of Friends. Leaving Ulverstone by the south road, about two hundred yardspast the railway station, a bye-path leads over the fields on the right hand a little way, then down into a shady dell, through which a clear rivulet plays its moodymusic, running out of sight again at the south end, under thick, low-lapping branches, which gaze into it and daily with its silvery ripples, as if in love with this limpidministrel, whose song softens into silence in the woods beyond. This quiet dell is a fairy chapel of sylvan beauty, where the ceaseless hymn of nature is seldom disturbedby other sounds. In the deepest part of the hollow, and old stone bridge, shaded by tall trees, crosses the stream; from thence a rugged footpath climbs the opposite fields, and in about a quarter of a mile leads close by the rear of a boary pile of stone outhouses of rude appearance. The road may be miry, but whoever he be that goes that way, in rain or fair weather, let him linger there a breathing while, for the old house in front of these buildings in Swarthmoor Hall, the residence of George Fox. On my firstvisit, I wandered about some time before I could find any human creature astir. A contemplative charm seemed to lie upon all around. The house is a large, irregular, Elizabethian building, with nothing grand about it, save the impressive memories of the great reformer who dwelt in it two centuries ago. The doorways are small; some ofthe windows are built up; and it has altogether a bald appearance, considering its size and former importance. But the home of the persecuted puritan still looks over thosequiet fields with a kind of ascetic solemnity, as if it was mingling dreams of the past with a patient waiting for the result of slow decay. I wandered about the rough, cattle-trodden yard, among mire, and straw, and farming-gear, yet all was still, except a few ducks dabbling in a muddy pool, and a peaceful dog that roamedabout the outhouses, regardless of my presence. There was no sign of life even about the windows. At last, I came to a kind of kitchen at the rear of the hall, where Ifound the mistress of the house and her servants, throng at their washing. When I had explained the purpose of my visit, the mistress pointed to a rude gate at the end, which opened to the front of the hall. I went through and found myself in a little green paddock, where there was not even one rose left\" to mark where a garden had been.\" There were the principal windows, - one little window looking out from George Fox's study; the other two were old-fashioned bay windows, much larger. Between there was thesmall old doorway, to which two rude stone steps led up. All else was plain and unpretending; and all other windows in the lower part of the frontage were built up. Inside, I was shown the\" hall,\" a quaint, flagged apartment, on the ground floor, with a great old-fashioned fire-place, and a kind of stone dais in the recess of the mullionedwindow. Here, I was told, the earliest meetings of the\" Friends\" were held. From this room, two steps led up to the little solemn sanctuary which was Fox's study; and Ifelt as if every footfall there was an intrusion; for that dim-lighted room, with its tiny lattice and quaint furniture, was the cell of a saint,\" of whom the world was not worthy.\" His bed has been removed from its ancient apartmentinto a room where the farm servants sleep; and I was told that the Bible is now in the possession of a lady belonging to the Society of Friends, in Ulverstone. Before Foxmarried the pious widow of Judge Fell, he was once dragged from this house and imprisoned all night in Ulverstone, under a guard of fifteen men, some of whom were perchedin the fireplace, for fear that he should fly up the chimney, and so escape. From thence he was removed to Lancaster Castle, where he suffered a long imprisonment. GeorgeFox seems to have turned Ulverstone and the country about it upside down in those days, preaching in all sorts of pulpits and private houses, and sometimes in the openmarket-place. He was once shamefully maltreated in the churchyard of St Mary's, at Ulverstone, after preaching to the congregation there. About a quarter of a mile west of the hall there is a plain substantial chapel, - the first chapel of the disciples of George Fox, - built at his own cost, in 1688. It stands in a little flagged enclosure, surrounded by a stone wall about nine feet high. The white door of the yard was open when I saw it, and the\" Friends\" were met within, - yet there was no sound, but the sea breeze whistling across the fields of Swarthmoor. Above the entrance was this inscription, plainly graven,\" Ex dono, G.F., 1688.\" At the western end of the chapelthere is a croft, which was presented with the chapel, for the accomodation of the horses of such Friends as came from a distance.","file_id":"1860_a","plnames":[["Ulverstone",12,22],["Leven",178,183],["Furness",216,223],["George",559,565],["Ulverstone",614,624],["George",1668,1674],["George",3102,3108],["Ulverstone",4092,4102],["Ulverstone",4217,4227],["Lancaster Castle",4391,4407],["Ulverstone",4479,4489],["Ulverstone",4704,4714],["George",4878,4884]],"geonouns":[["country",31,38],["road",71,75],["station",85,92],["town",119,123],["vale",152,156],["estuary",184,191],["hills",203,208],["points",276,282],["head",310,314],["market",358,364],["residence",546,555],["road",638,642],["railway",676,683],["station",684,691],["path",699,703],["fields",719,725],["dell",781,785],["woods",1054,1059],["dell",1079,1083],["chapel",1095,1101],["hollow",1218,1224],["stone",1234,1239],["bridge",1240,1246],["trees",1263,1268],["stream",1282,1288],["fields",1340,1346],["stone",1424,1429],["road",1464,1468],["house",1597,1602],["buildings",1621,1630],["residence",1655,1664],["house",1828,1833],["building",1870,1878],["fields",2204,2210],["hall",2677,2681],["house",2716,2721],["gate",2842,2846],["hall",2892,2896],["bay",3155,3158],["stone",3239,3244],["hall",3392,3396],["ground",3435,3441],["stone",3502,3507],["bed",3897,3900],["farm",3966,3970],["house",4183,4188],["country",4498,4505],["houses",4588,4594],["hall",4797,4801],["chapel",4831,4837],["chapel",4851,4857],["stone",4981,4986],["wall",4987,4991],["door",5024,5028],["sea",5134,5137],["fields",5166,5172],["entrance",5198,5206],["chapel",5347,5353]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",102,113],["pleasantly",127,137],["convenient",242,252],["leads",704,709],["right",733,738],["clear",803,808],["love",983,987],["quiet",1073,1078],["beauty",1112,1118],["leads",1381,1386],["fair",1531,1535],["charm",1787,1792],["grand",1893,1898],["impressive",1918,1928],["great",1945,1950],["patient",2293,2300],["peaceful",2499,2507],["led",3251,3254],["quaint",3401,3407],["great",3456,3461],["led",3645,3648],["quaint",3814,3820],["saint",3850,3855],["worthy",3884,3890],["breeze",5138,5144]],"neg_words":[["shady",775,780],["rude",1443,1447],["lie",1803,1806],["irregular",1846,1855],["slow",2327,2331],["decay",2332,2337],["rough",2360,2365],["mire",2394,2398],["muddy",2481,2486],["mistress",2700,2708],["mistress",2815,2823],["rude",2837,2841],["rude",3234,3238],["solemn",3666,3672],["intrusion",3750,3759],["dim",3770,3773],["dragged",4165,4172],["fear",4306,4310],["suffered",4418,4426],["imprisonment",4434,4446],["shamefully",4647,4657]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",390,395],["many years",530,540],["daily",942,947],["two centuries ago",1976,1993],["the\"",3387,3391],["the\"",3594,3598],["fifteen",4246,4253],["those days",4530,4540],["1688",4918,4922],["the\"",5069,5073],["1688",5261,5265]],"times":[["all night",4204,4213]],"distances":[["about a mile",478,490],["a quarter of a mile",1361,1380],["a quarter of a mile",4765,4784],["about nine feet",4992,5007]],"loc_advs":[["there",1560,1565],["home",2145,2149],["past",2281,2285],["there",2963,2968],["left",2991,2995],["there",3189,3194],["there",3737,3742],["there",4752,4757],["there",4802,4807],["there",5106,5111]],"spa_preps":[["about",39,44],["near",76,80],["among",193,198],["into",407,411],["about",644,649],["over",710,714],["down",763,767],["into",768,772],["through",787,794],["out",847,850],["under",884,889],["into",930,934],["into",1034,1038],["beyond",1060,1066],["opposite",1331,1339],["about",1355,1360],["close",1387,1392],["about",1709,1714],["around",1816,1822],["about",1899,1904],["over",2188,2192],["about",2350,2355],["among",2388,2393],["about",2602,2607],["through",2905,2912],["out",3093,3096],["under",4229,4234],["about",4506,4511],["down",4522,4526],["within",5092,5098],["across",5155,5161]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0081632653,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988480806},{"para_id":68,"paragraph":"About a mile west of Fox's Chapel, a byeway leads into the old Roman road, at a place where a tesselated pavement was found a few years ago.

The direct road to it lies through the old village of Urswick. At the end of this village there is a fine tarn close by the highway. The people of Urswick Vale have a legend that ruins of an ancient town lie beneath the waters of this tarn. Near Urswick there is the small monastic ruinof Bolton Chapel, standing in a farm-yard, by the road, and now used as a cowhouse. Leaving this village, we pass Redmond Hall, the seat of a family once known in Englishhistory. About a mile from Gleaston Castle, in a hollow of the fields, on the left hand side of the road, there is a pretty little sheet of water, called Mere Tarn, swarmingwith pike. he ruins of Gleaston Castle are of con - siderable extent. The castle originally consisted of four square towers, connected by strong curtain walls, defending an enclosure, the length of which seemed to me aboutone hundred years. One of these towers has disappeared, and the other three are more or less ruinous; but the summits of two may yet be easily ascended by the stone steps which wind up in the thickness of the massivewalls. In its palmy days, this castle must have looked imposing in the heart of the little vale, where it seems to have been placed more for shelter and seclusion thanfor anything commanding in position. it was built by the Flemings, lords of the ancient manor of Much Land. The possessions of Michael le Fleming were the only lands in all Furness exempted from the grant made by Stephen, Earl of Bologne and moreton, to Furness Abbey. The name of this Michael, which the natives pronounce\" Mickle,\" stillclings to old associations in this neighbourhood, as n the case of\" Mickle Well,\" not meaning great well, but\" Michael's Well.\" I remember how, on that breezy day, when, with two friends, I visited the ruins of this castle, as we were casting in a mossy corner at the entrance of the village. The stones about it were worn by the footing of many generations, and the water was so clear that I could have seen a single thread of a lady's hair at the bottom of it. I remember, too, that when we were beginningto despair of finding any-thing like substantial refreshment, we met with it at the very last house on the western edge of the village, a clean little hostelry, where wegot an excellent dinner of eggs and bacon, cheese, ale, pickles, salad fresh from the garden behind the house, and three quarts of buttermilk; in addition to which, I hadmy shoe mended; and we were treated with more than common civilty, all for the low charge of three and sixpence, - which was received with satisfaction. The way of the shoebusiness was this, - I had burst the seam of it, and it was getting squashy with wet, for we had had a delightfully rough tramp over moss and fell, and through miry bye-roads, that day. The good wife at the alehouse offered to get it mended for me whilst dinner was cooking. The oldman lent me a shoe of his own to put on meanwhile. It was as hardas an iron pot; in fact, it had a consider-able weight of iron work about it, and for any rough work, I felt that that one shoe was worth at least four pair such as mine. With one foot handi-capped in this clog of iron and leather, I amused myself with walking about the clean floor of slate stone, listening to the difference of sound in myfoot-steps, which went\" fuzz, clang-fuzz, clang,\" reminding me of the three bells of a little country church that I have heard of, one of which was sound, the next cracked, and the third mended with leather, - their united music amounting to a kind of\" ding, dang, puff.\" The shoe came back mended before dinner was over, and a thrill of returningcomfort went through my frame when I got it on, for I had felt as if walking with a wet dish-cloth round my foot a while before. As we returned through the village, oneof my friends proposed that we should just look in upon a relation of his, an old shoemaker, and a quaint man, well versed in the folk lore of the dis - trict. He then led us up to one of the most comfortable-looking cottages I ever saw. The floor was as clean as a plate just laid down for dinner, the place smelt as sweetas an herb-stall, and all the polishable metal things shone like pools of water in moonlight. The cheerful old wife, whose ruddy face was bedded in a snowy old-fashionedcap, and whose eyes, in spite of age and spectacles looked as bright as the stars on a frosty night, rose from her arm-chair, and hobbled about with her crutch, smilingand talking, and talking and smiling, as if she did n't know exactl what to do to show that she was very fain.

A boat may be had at the pier, to the island, which is immediately opposite, divided from the main land by a narrow channel. Going by way of Barrow the distance by rail is about twelve miles; but the route is more varied. No other way of approachingthe ruins of this fortress is so impressive as by boat from Barrow, which is easily obtained, especially if\" civil old Joe Winder\" be about. This route also gives the tourist a good opportunity ofseeing the harbour, in which the British navy might ride safely in the wildest weather. The isle of Walney, Rampside, and the most characteristic objects of this remotenook of the Furness shore, are in sight from the water. Barrow itself is an interesting spot. It is now the great port of Furness, and a place of increasing importance. Here, most of the ore of the district is shipped for Carron and Swansea, where it is used to enrich the poorer ores of Scotland and Wales. Hollinshed says that the Scots, in the reign of Edward the Second, during one of their raids into England,\" met with no iron worth their notice until they came to Furness, in Lancashire, where they seized all the manufactured iron they could find, and carried it off with the greatest joy, though so heavy of carriage and preferred it to allother plunder.\" Om Barrow and its neighbourhood, as in many other parts of Furness, roads, houses, cattle, and men are more or less colouride with oxide of iron. A Furnessminer, when disguised in his Sunday clothes, is seldom slow to tell you that he has\" taen his degreen | i' the Red Lone College.\" The view of Peel Castle, as the boat nearthe island from Barrow, is very striking. The castle was built by the Abbots of Furness, in the reign of Edward the Third, upon an older foundation, supposed to be theremains of a Danish fortress. These fierce sea-rovers often ravaged this part of the coast, and the terrors of their name linger yet among its traditions. The castle hasbeen a place of much greater extent and strength than now appears. On the eastern side of the island, where high tides wash the base of the ruins, immense blocks of wall, which have been many years among the waters, are yet as firmly held together by their old cement as if they were solid rock. On the east and southern sides, the sea nowcovers a great extent of the old foundations, which are visible, here and there, under water. On the north and western sides, the two great ditches, the double lines ofwall, and the strong flanking towers, still give some idea of the strength of the ancient defences. Near the ruins, there are two cottages, where the only inhabitants ofthe island reside. The largest of these cottages is a public-house, chiefly frequented by sailors from the harbours.

A coach starts thither from the latter place every day in summer. The road is full of interestingvariety, winding by the banks of the River Leven almost all the way. On the right hand the upper part of the estuary stretches out from near the highway, bounded by thefells and beautiful shores of Cartmel; on the left, the green hills of Low Furness throw their shadows, here and there, across the way. The River Leven brings down thewaters of Windermere to the sea. About four miles on the road, the beautiful valley of the Crake opens up on the western side, and the summits of the Coniston range arein sight. Through this valley the River Crake empties the waters of Coniston into the Leven. If any sojourner at Ulverston designes a fine walk through picturesque scenery, let him go about two miles along this high road from Ulverstone, then up Newland Vale about a mile, and then northward across the hills a mile and a half, down to the village of Penny Bridge, at which spot he may be safely left to the influence of the scene. From these high grounds, between Newland Vale and Crank Vale, there are glorious views of the Coniston mountains. Near the entrance of the Crake valley the road passes in picturesque little village and Fort of Greenodd, over the hills, there is an interesting old Baptist chapel, built in the intolerant days of the\" Five Mile Act.\" At Backbarrow - where a stranger may be surprised to find a cotton-mill in such a spot - the River Leven falls over the rocks beautifully on the right-hand side of the road. Thence, to Newby Bridge, the road lies through a delightful wood-land scene between the hills, with the river shining and singing all the way over its old bed of mossy rocks, down in the left-hand hollow. The old mansion-like inn, called the White Swan, is delightful situated by the clear Leven side. In front, a quaint bridge of five arches spans the stream, and a few yards below it the river runs over a little fall, filling the quiet vale with its drowsy song by night and day. Above the bridge, the water comes down from Windermere through lovely scenery, gradually narrowing from a lake to a river, with the current of water scarcely discernible. The picturesque old inn, the bridge, the river, the drowsy fall, the choral woods and every object in the hollow of this green nest of the mountains, is full of beauty and repose; and the hills that shut them in from the rest of the world heighten the general charm. The clear river glides by the front of the in, with only road between. It is pleasant to sit at the upper windows, or on the green flower-garnished benches below, in a still summer evening, listening to the birds and the waterfall, and watching the fish leaping up from the glittering water, as if giving a last frolicsome defiance to the cooks at the White Swan.
