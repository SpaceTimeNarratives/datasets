The Mackereths' cottage is called the Wyke Cottage; it stands on the north side of the road that leads from Grasmere to Langdale, about half a mile from the church. It is a very small, stone-built cottage, with one of those round chimneys which form such a pretty feature of the houses in that district. A tall yew and a Scotch fir rise very high above it. Behind rise the shining steeps of Silver How, from which, down a rocky fell, rich in underwood and ferns and flowers, rushes the noisy and impetuous torrent which had so nearly carried into the lake our little Westmorland maiden. The stream is not wide, but, when full, it is deep, and full of rugged boulders. Here dwelt the Mackereths-- parish clerks for some generations; but, at an earlier period, one or more of them were\" priests.\" This is the name still given to the clergyman in these parts by most of the old people; it is doubtless a relic of pre-Reformation times. In those earlier days, in the Lake district, when a vacancy fell in a living, a successor was not fetched from some unknown distance; some grave and clerkly man from the same dale would serve their turn, who laboured both as minister and schoolmaster, perhaps all in one building-- the parish church. Such was the origin of Robert Walker, so well known as\" Wonderful Walker,\" for sixty years minister of Seathwaite Chapel and parish schoolmaster, and very frequently a day-labourer, working for hire for his own parishioners. He was born in the little cottage-farm of Undercrag, in his own Seathwaite, which is the next parish to the north of this parish of Broughton In-Furness. It has been remarked to me, by those who have long known them, that there has always been a certain refinement, a superior nature, that has distinguished the members of the Mackereth family. They may be truly called\" the gentry of the soil\"-- noble examples of simple and pure native excellence, owing little to education, little to intercourse with those who move in the higher ranks of life. They retain the rustic simplicity, they practise the untutored and artless courtesy which we love to imagine, but do not often discover, in the English peasant life.","file_id":"1890_a","plnames":[["Grasmere",168,176],["Langdale",180,188],["Silver How",451,461],["Westmorland",627,638],["Seathwaite Chapel",1397,1414],["Seathwaite",1583,1593],["Broughton",1651,1660],["Furness",1664,1671]],"geonouns":[["cottage",76,83],["road",147,151],["church",217,223],["stone",245,250],["cottage",257,264],["houses",339,345],["district",354,362],["fell",488,492],["lake",611,615],["stream",651,657],["parish",756,762],["district",1028,1036],["fell",1053,1057],["dale",1168,1172],["parish",1279,1285],["church",1286,1292],["parish",1419,1425],["cottage",1545,1552],["farm",1553,1557],["parish",1613,1619],["parish",1641,1647]],"pos_words":[["courageous",43,53],["leads",157,162],["pretty",317,323],["rich",494,498],["doubtless",949,958],["well",1335,1339],["refinement",1773,1783],["superior",1787,1795],["distinguished",1813,1826],["noble",1916,1921],["pure",1945,1949],["excellence",1957,1967],["love",2160,2164]],"neg_words":[["rocky",482,487],["noisy",546,551],["impetuous",556,565],["torrent",566,573],["unknown",1109,1116]],"events":[],"dates":[["A few days",0,10],["those earlier days",996,1014],["sixty years",1373,1384],["a day",1460,1465]],"times":[],"distances":[["about half a mile",190,207]],"loc_advs":[["there",1741,1746]],"spa_preps":[["round",284,289],["above",407,412],["down",475,479],["into",602,606]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0406091371,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983028173},{"para_id":32,"paragraph":"See the next paper,\" Wordsworth and the Duddon.\"","file_id":"1890_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",21,31],["Duddon",40,46]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9892086387},{"para_id":33,"paragraph":"Little Sarah early lost her mother.

This rocky pile of split and fissured crags, on a near examination, is found to be well worth the long rough walk by which it is to be reached. Let me, then( just fresh from an actual inspection), endeavour to describe the nature and appearance of these singular crags. The way upon wheels or on horseback from Broughton would be over Duddon Bridge, past Duddon Hall, rising on the wild fell road to Bootle, until, at about six miles from Broughton, it brings you within a mile and a half of the crags. Here the carriage must be left( and there is no shelter for it for a long way), and the horseman or pedestrian must make the best of his way over rising rough and boggy ground to the height of about 900 feet above the sea-level, where he reaches the strange gloomy pile of jagged and broken, shattered and riven volcanic rocks, of which it seems natural to believe that we are actually standing over the crater of a small extinct volcano. It stands isolated on the ridge of the fell, a conspicuous object from Broughton, covering a space of about three or four acres. The huge rampart of black rock, blasted and tormented by the storms of a thousand ages, bristles with vast blocks or pinnacles of a hard volcanic ash. Awful for their dark immovable grandeur, they sternly rise bold and bluff, here into pinnacled crags, there worn down by the innumerable tempests which have beaten fiercely upon them from some period long anterior to the Glacial Age down to the soft, though still transitional, beauty of the age in which we now live. Grand is the belt of the everlasting hills which encircle us in the far-distant horizon on the land side, and the blue sea and the spreading yellow sands of Duddon to the west and south. And yet this wondrous scene is one of the almost unknown spots of the borderland of the Lake District. No guide-book but Baddeley's refers to it. I dare say none have ever visited it but the neighbouring shepherds, the sportsmen, and the officers of the Geological and other Ordnance Surveys. I believe it to be a once submarine, and then upheaved, volcano. A hard volcanic ash, light grey and spotted with white, composes it, and a lava harder still crops out in a south-easterly direction. Some little conception of the geological history of these fells is a sensible addition to the interest felt in their exploration. Here, within the short space of a mile, are visible evidences both of the existence of the volcanic fires of past ages and of glacial action. After the age of fire, succeeded, at a long interval, the ice age, when the vale of Duddon was just as full of ice, in all the sublime glory and majesty of glacier forms, as is the Rhone Glacier now for twenty - five miles above the living source of the infant Rhone. But how do we know this? We know it certainly by the evidence of the action of the grinding and polishing of the ice-torrent, in its slow and ponderous passage down to the icy sea below, upon the hardened volcanic ash through which the Duddon at length has worn its way. Just above the Duddon woods stretch out long spaces of hardened rock, polished to the smoothness of glass by the passage of the ice-torrent, bearing down with it the boulders and the gravels, which have planed the rugged surfaces of rock to that polish which they retain down to this day.
