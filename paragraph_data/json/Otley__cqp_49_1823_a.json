From Newby Bridge to Ulverston is 8 miles, Ulverston to Dalton 5, and thence to Furness Abbey 2 miles.

And, Green's Guide will long remain a monument of the assiduity with which he pryed into the arcana of these mountains.","file_id":"1823_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",3,12]],"geonouns":[["region",171,177],["entrance",244,252],["country",353,360],["monument",586,594],["mountains",657,666]],"pos_words":[["interesting",159,170],["useful",292,298],["revive",470,476],["pleasing",500,508]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["about",361,366],["into",632,636]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0666666667,"vader_sentiment":0.9,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986320138},{"para_id":227,"paragraph":"From Ambleside to Keswick. -- The road from Ambleside to Keswick affords a charming variety; it passes, first Rydal Water, and the extensive slate quarry at White Moss; and then, leads through the beautiful vale of Grasmere, so much extolled by Mr. Gray. Crossing the hill called Dunmail Raise, where a large heap of stones marks the boundary of Westmorland and Cumberland, the lofty Skiddaw shews his venerable head in the distance; and presently a view of Thirlmere or Leathes' Water is obtained. The gap of Dunmail Raise, 720 feet above the level of the sea, is the lowest pass from north to south, through the mountain chain which extends from Black Combe into the county of Durham. The roads over Shap Fells, and Stainmoor, being each above 1400 feet. After passing the small inn and Chapel of Wythburn, and approaching the margin of the lake, Helvellyn is upon the right; but the road lies so near its base, that the full height of the mountain cannot be seen. A little beyond the sixth mile stone from Keswick, the summit of Skiddaw again appears to the left of the wooded hill called Great How; to the right of which, and more in front, is a delightful view of the vale of Legberthwaite, through which the road leads; a continuation of this valley takes the names of Fornside, and Wanthwaite, together constituting what is called St. John's Vale; beyond which the lofty Saddleback, with its furrowed front, closes the scene. A road turns off on the right towards Threlkeld, and passes under the bold castle-like rock of Green Crag, sometimes called the Castle rock of St. John's. Surmounting the cultivated ridge called Castlerigg, at one mile from Keswick, there is a full view of Derwent Lake, with part of that of Bassenthwaite, the town and vale of Keswick, with its surrounding mountains.

On leaving the street the prospect is over Crow Park, which at the time of the attainder of the late Earl of Derwentwater, was a wood of stately oaks; but now a fine, swelling, verdant field, on which races are annually held. Beyond this the view embraces the vale and mountains of Newlands, with High Stile presiding over Buttermere in the distance: in retrospect Skiddaw rises majestically over the town. On the left, lies Cockshot, a hill thickly covered with oaks, and a tall silver fir upon its crest; the trees intercept the views from its summit, but a walk round its margin may sometimes be taken on account of the shelter it affords. Coming in sight of the lake, Vicar's Isle is most happily placed, the house just appearing among a variety of forest trees with which the island seems wholly covered; but on inspection, it is found to be beautifully laid out in pleasure grounds, and kept in the neatest order. Along the margin of the water numerous boats are moored, some belonging to private individuals, others kept for the accommodation of visitors; and at the termination of the walk on the low promontory of Friar Crag, the eye is saluted with a full prospect of the lake, bounded by the far famed mountains of Borrowdale. To the left, near the shore, Stable Hills farm is reared, upon the site where stood Lord Derwentwater's stables at the time his mansion was upon the adjacent island. The Parks, part cultivated, part wooded, occupy the rising ground, over which Wallow Crag shews his massive rocky front; those, with the lands betwixt the town and lake, form the Derwentwater estate, now belonging to Greenwich Hospital. Further on lies Barrow House, and above it the pastoral farm of Ashness; beyond the small island of Rampsholm pours the famed cataract of Lowdore; and Castle Crag appears between more lofty mountains, like a centinel placed to guard the entrance of Borrowdale. To the right of St. Herbert's Isle, Catbells with a front of lighter green, shelve into the lake; which is chiefly bordered on that side by the woods of the late Lord William Gordon. Looking through the lateral vale of Newlands Red Pike appears beyond Buttermere, and more to the right Causey Pike, and Grisedale Pike, shew their aspiring peaks.","file_id":"1823_a","plnames":[["Friar Crag",29,39],["Crow Park",233,242],["Derwentwater",299,311],["Newlands",472,480],["High Stile",487,497],["Buttermere",513,523],["Skiddaw",555,562],["Cockshot",615,623],["Vicar's Isle",862,874],["Friar Crag",1313,1323],["Borrowdale",1416,1426],["Stable Hills",1457,1469],["Derwentwater",1517,1529],["The Parks",1594,1603],["Wallow Crag",1672,1683],["Derwentwater",1773,1785],["Greenwich Hospital",1811,1829],["Barrow House",1847,1859],["Ashness",1895,1902],["Rampsholm",1931,1940],["Lowdore",1969,1976],["Castle Crag",1982,1993],["Borrowdale",2080,2090],["St. Herbert's Isle",2108,2126],["Catbells",2128,2136],["Newlands Red Pike",2311,2328],["Buttermere",2344,2354],["Causey Pike",2378,2389],["Grisedale Pike",2395,2409]],"geonouns":[["water",14,19],["town",139,143],["street",205,211],["wood",319,323],["field",375,380],["vale",450,454],["mountains",459,468],["town",591,595],["hill",627,631],["trees",701,706],["summit",736,742],["lake",856,860],["house",903,908],["forest",943,949],["trees",950,955],["island",971,977],["grounds",1070,1077],["water",1134,1139],["boats",1149,1154],["promontory",1299,1309],["lake",1372,1376],["mountains",1403,1412],["shore",1450,1455],["farm",1470,1474],["mansion",1556,1563],["island",1586,1592],["ground",1653,1659],["lands",1731,1736],["town",1749,1753],["lake",1758,1762],["farm",1887,1891],["island",1921,1927],["cataract",1957,1965],["mountains",2021,2030],["entrance",2068,2076],["lake",2184,2188],["woods",2236,2241],["vale",2303,2307],["peaks",2431,2436]],"pos_words":[["gratification",162,175],["stately",327,334],["happily",883,890],["variety",932,939],["beautifully",1037,1048],["pleasure",1061,1069],["neatest",1095,1102],["famed",1397,1402],["famed",1951,1956],["like",2032,2036],["right",2099,2104],["lighter",2153,2160],["right",2372,2377]],"neg_words":[["swelling",357,365],["lies",610,614],["rocky",1702,1707],["lies",1842,1846]],"events":[],"dates":[["three quarters",60,74],["a fine",349,355],["annually",401,409]],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile",78,84]],"loc_advs":[["left",604,608],["left",1435,1439],["beyond",1904,1910],["beyond",2337,2343]],"spa_preps":[["over",228,232],["over",508,512],["over",582,586],["round",755,760],["among",924,929],["out",1054,1057],["near",1441,1445],["over",1661,1665],["above",1865,1870],["between",2002,2009],["into",2175,2179],["through",2283,2290]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0378151261,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988479614},{"para_id":235,"paragraph":"Excellent views of the vale and mountains are also obtained from the Vicarage, from Ormathwaite, from many parts of the road a little elevated on the foot of Skiddaw, and from the side of Latrigg.

Two miles from Keswick, with the lake on the right, a road turns off to Watendlath; a little further is Barrow House, behind which is a fine cascade. Barrow House, the property of Roger Pocklington, Esq. of Muskham House, Nottinghamshire; as also that upon the Island, now General Peachy's; and one at Derwent Bank, afterwards purchased by Lord William Gordon;-- were built by the late Mr. Pocklington. His style of building was rather singular, and has occasioned many severe remarks. At the time of his first becoming acquainted with the neighbourhood of Keswick it was comparatively little known, and he was desirous of contributing to its celebrity; and though his attempts to improve the face of the country failed to meet with general approbation; yet, his errors of judgment were fully compensated by the liberality of his motives, and Keswick may long remember his name as one of its first benefactors. Three miles from Keswick is Lowdore, famous for its waterfall. A mile further is the Grange, which is a name of frequent occurrence in situations near some river; as, Grange, in Cartmel parish-- Grange, at Bampton-- and Marsh Grange, near the River Duddon. About Lowdore and Grange, the draftsman will find employment for his pencil, and the geologist will observe the transition from the dark coloured clay slate to the more variously aggregated and paler coloured slaty rocks. The river may be crossed at Grange, but to proceed a mile further to the Bowder Stone will generally be preferred; not altogether for a sight of the stone itself,( though it is considered as a curiosity, being a large fragment of rock pitched in a singular position,) but more especially for a prospect here displayed of the higher parts of Borrowdale. Returning to Grange, the road then crosses the river, and is carried along a pleasant elevation above the woods of the late Lord William Gordon, which, with the house standing on a sheltered bay of the lake, have lately been offered for sale. From this elevation, the lake-- with its islands, bays, and promontories-- is seen to great advantage.

Being generally too soft for some purposes, a method of hardening it had long been a desideratum; and a process has at length been discovered, by which it may be rendered capable of bearing a finer and more durable point, but its colour will be somewhat deteriorated.","file_id":"1823_a","plnames":[["Keswick",418,425],["London",620,626]],"geonouns":[["wood",896,900],["point",1320,1325]],"pos_words":[["capable",6,13],["great",28,33],["excellence",120,130],["famed",440,445],["great",472,477],["improvements",478,490],["lead",612,616],["suitable",871,879],["skill",984,989],["soft",1125,1129],["capable",1276,1283],["finer",1297,1302],["durable",1312,1319]],"neg_words":[["friction",146,154],["dying",315,320],["imaginary",360,369]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",39,46],["without",760,767]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0952380952,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986668825},{"para_id":317,"paragraph":"Great quantities of pencils are now made of a composition, formed of the saw-dust and small pieces of black-lead, which being ground to an impalpable powder, is mixed with some cohesive medium: for this purpose different substances are employed, some of which make a very inferior pencil; but others being united at a proper degree of heat, and consolidated by a strong pressure, make a pencil to answer for many purposes,( especially where the writing is intended to be permanent,) full as well as the genuine black-lead.","file_id":"1823_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["ground",126,132]],"pos_words":[["lead",108,112],["cohesive",177,185],["proper",318,324],["strong",363,369],["well",491,495],["genuine",503,510],["lead",517,521]],"neg_words":[["dust",77,81],["inferior",272,280]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.1136363636,"vader_sentiment":0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977091551},{"para_id":318,"paragraph":"The specific gravity of the best wad, or black lead, is, to that of water, as two to one nearly: the coarser kind is heavier in proportion, as it contains more stony matter.
