Its surface was calm, and reflected the dark and towering crags that rose from its margin; which crags seemed to be the base of the eastern pyramid. With these impenetrable bars on our right, we turned to the left and kept still ascending, till we came to the foot of another prodigious rock, which we deemed the base of the middle Pike. The summit of the stupendous mountain we had ascended is crowned with three lofty pikes, all composed of terrific and perpendicular rocks, frowning with dreadful majesty. Seen from the valleys below, they appear to rise at no great distance from each other; but when the mountain is ascended, the traveller may toil with many a weary step ere his labours reach from one to another; and he may look with alarm on many a frightful precipice ere he ascend to the summit of their terrific pinnacles. That to the north-west seems the lowest, but most regular and conical; that to the south is next in elevation, but more broken and rugged. That to the east overlooks the rest, and indeed all these mountainous regions; and rises in masses of immense rocks that are beheld with horror, and whose forms cannot be ascertained. At a distance, the eye shapes them into somewhat regular forms; but exploring their tremendous recesses, the traveller is alarmed and bewildered. To these sublime and dreadful regions I ascended with my intrepid maids, and was the first to express anything like fear. Catherine, who feels a kindness for the whole creation, offered me her hand; while Elizabeth, with a courage I had never met with before, proposed to explore what remained, and, winding round the corner of a rock, presently ascended out of sight. I have felt pain from the absence of those I value; the absence of Elizabeth was terribly extended, and was accompanied with feelings of distress. From some situations at a great distance, Langdale Pikes had appeared like prodigious pillars: it somehow or other suddenly impressed me as if we were high up on the side of one of these pillars, and in danger of slipping down. Under these impressions, Elizabeth's absence was a period of dreadful suspense: I knew not whether she might be clambering up the cliffs above us, or falling down the precipices below;-- her sisters, too, began to think her long. But we were at length relieved by her calling to us from the cliffs over our heads. In her descent she had missed her way, and got on a shelf of rocks higher than that on which we sat. However, we soon got all together again, and joyfully eat our dinners amid these aerial halls of Nature. Who is there that need be discouraged at undertakings, however apparently arduous? For perhaps ten years I had projected an expedition to this alpine mountain, and this day it was accomplished: but who would ever have conceived that I should have been led on by such amiable conductors?","file_id":"1824_a","plnames":[["Pike",585,589],["Elizabeth",1761,1770],["Elizabeth",1992,2001],["Langdale Pikes",2114,2128],["Elizabeth",2325,2334]],"geonouns":[["peak",68,72],["water",210,215],["mountain",243,251],["crags",311,316],["crags",350,355],["foot",513,517],["rock",540,544],["summit",595,601],["mountain",620,628],["pikes",673,678],["rocks",723,728],["valleys",776,783],["mountain",862,870],["precipice",1020,1029],["summit",1051,1057],["regions",1296,1303],["rocks",1336,1341],["regions",1586,1593],["winding",1856,1863],["rock",1886,1890],["precipices",2467,2477],["heads",2607,2612],["rocks",2675,2680],["halls",2803,2808],["mountain",2970,2978]],"pos_words":[["right",188,193],["great",196,201],["calm",269,273],["right",438,443],["prodigious",529,539],["stupendous",609,619],["terrific",696,704],["majesty",753,760],["great",817,822],["terrific",1067,1075],["immense",1328,1335],["sublime",1565,1572],["like",1667,1671],["kindness",1701,1709],["courage",1779,1786],["great",2098,2103],["like",2142,2146],["prodigious",2147,2157],["impressed",2196,2205],["joyfully",2760,2768],["accomplished",3000,3012],["led",3072,3075],["amiable",3087,3094]],"neg_words":[["slowly",154,160],["dark",293,297],["dreadful",744,752],["toil",902,906],["weary",919,924],["alarm",994,999],["frightful",1010,1019],["broken",1207,1213],["alarmed",1532,1539],["bewildered",1544,1554],["dreadful",1577,1585],["fear",1672,1676],["pain",1937,1941],["absence",1951,1958],["absence",1981,1988],["terribly",2006,2014],["distress",2062,2070],["danger",2275,2281],["absence",2337,2344],["dreadful",2361,2369],["falling",2450,2457],["missed",2637,2643],["arduous",2894,2901]],"events":[],"dates":[["a period of",2349,2360],["ten years",2915,2924],["this day",2984,2992]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",462,466],["below",784,789],["together",2740,2748],["there",2827,2832]],"spa_preps":[["into",1445,1449],["round",1864,1869],["out",1911,1914],["down",2294,2298],["above",2437,2442],["down",2458,2462],["over",2598,2602],["amid",2785,2789]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.37,"roberta_sentiment":0.9905269146},{"para_id":12,"paragraph":"The clouds were now collecting in the south, which hastened our descent down the mountain; yet the threatened rain did not prevent our visiting the waterfall in Dungeon Gill; where, in a fissure of the mountain, and inclosed by gloomy rocks, a considerable stream is discovered tumbling from a lofty precipice into a deep and dark bason.

At Chapel Hill, in a corner of the world, stood a simple cottage among rocks, woods, and solitary mountains: it bore on its varied roofs and numerous gable-ends the marks of former centuries; its owners had lived there in succession for many generations. A few paces took them to Madale Chapel, their place of worship; and when they died, their long home was on their own premises. They were surrounded by woody knolls; and these knolls were surrounded by lofty mountains. Most of these remain, and will remain. I only regret that the ancient cottage, with its accompaniments, is superseded by the modern house, with its five windows in front.

Being at Ambleside, not long after a heavy load of snow had encumbered the mountains, and intending to cross Kirkstone, I was told it was impracticable; that no person had crossed it since the snow fell; that the lanes and hollows of the mountains were filled; and that if I was bent on home I must go by Threlkeld. I did not like the idea of fifteen additional miles to my day's ride, so I determined to attempt the passage pronounced impracticable; but not to advance farther than I could make good my retreat, if the passage were really impossible. I ascended the lane slowly, which was pretty well filled with snow, but did not stick, though frequently up to the girths: but when I had effected a passage through the lane, and was struggling with my difficulties through a hollow in the moun - tain, my horse stood still, and being nearly up to the neck, could advance no farther. I alighted, and treading the snow down from his sides, he turned round, and I clambered upon stones which appeared like the top of a broad wall, he following, for we appeared truly united; and thus we got clear of this difficulty: but others soon came upon us; drifts, higher than my horse, rose before us; I therefore scrambled up the side of the mountain where the wind had swept away the snow, and thus picked my path well as I was able, my horse following. When an opposing drift made the passage doubtful, I thrust my stick and my arm, to ascertain its depth, and discover whether the earth was sound beneath, for I sometimes heard the rumbling of unseen waters. One favourable circumstance was, that I had no wind to contend with; and again the summit of the pass of Kirkstone may be about half the height of sublime mountains which rose in succession on my right and left; so that I was surrounded by a magnificent snow-scene, with a due portion of the terrific to keep up their higher attentions. Thus slowly proceeding with all the prudence and caution I was master of,( though perhaps the reader will not give me much credit for either,) I perceived a man advancing as I descended. He was on foot; I hallooed to him: we soon got together; and two human being meeting in such a scene of desolation had something cheering in it. We conversed on our difficulties, and encouraging one another we parted.

The sides of the mountain seemed to be in motion with the driving of the snow, which the wind was sweeping into the valleys. In some places torrents of snow were streaming over the rocks; the sun shone faintly through the motley atmosphere, which considerably magnified the mountains: but in the bottom of the valleys all seemed an invisible tumult. The howling of the winds, and the barking of the shepherds' dogs, labouring to collect the scattered flock, but distant or near equally unseen, gave a bewildering animation to one hardly knows what. There was a strange wildness in the clouds, which bordered on the terrific; and one of them exhibited a beautiful appearance that I had never before observed: it was a small cloud that appeared suspended on the top of a high mountain, and seemed enriched with all the colours of the rainbow; red, yellow, green, blue, were all distinctly seen in this light cloud, but nothing of the circle of Iris's bow. In a few minutes it began to enlarge, and the colours to diminish; and in a little time took the appearance of the rest of its aerial companions. As I descended into the valleys I expected shelter and something of tranquillity; but there it was that confusion drove over confusion. I was completely immersed in a most perplexing vortex of snow, and assailed in every direction: the particles of snow, flying from the furious winds, strove who should first enter my eyes, ears, mouth, button-holes, boot-tops,&amp; c.

The reader will be fearful that I am growing quite eccentric; but if a little eccentricity lead to a little utility, perhaps I may for once be forgiven. Night Scenes are sometimes interesting; but to be immured in total darkness has something so like privation in it, that one would think, under such circumstances, there is no room for description. On the other hand, I have sometimes thought that in every portion of our lives there is something interesting. Under the latter consideration I shall introduce the following Night Walk: - - On entering a thick and solitary wood the night was uncommonly dark; and though I was well accustomed to the way, I was soon out of my path, and found myself entangled in the bushes: when, partly to make an experiment, and partly to amuse myself with my forlorn situation, I formed the resolution to make my way through the wood( between half a mile and a mile) with my eyes closed. Accordingly I winked and went on, with my staff in my hand, enjoying my fancy, and met with no interruption, save once coming down on a knee, till I nearly got through the wood; when, lo! I suddenly heard the tread of a man's foot, which instantly occasioned a singular sensation, and threw my musing tranquillity into a kind of thrill, or even a chill. I instantly opened my eyes, and saw the man and I were passing one another. I spoke to him:-- and he replied;-- and I found by his accent he was an Irishman. I before mentioned I wanted to make an experiment; which was the ascertain the difference, if any, in perception between a very dark night, and having one's eyes fully closed. I now found the difference was most manifest. I clearly distinguished the trees around me, as by a faint moonlight, and had not the least difficulty the rest of my way home.

We rode two miles on the south-west side of this lake to examine the water-fall of Scale Force: as we approached it, from appearance, my expectations were not very high as to its grandeur or beauty, but I was deceived. We entered an opening of perpendicular rocks six yards wide, and perhaps forty yards high. Our road was over pointed rocks, which, however, the frequent feet of strangers had somewhat blunted. From the rock-walks of this stupendous lane, which extended perhaps sixty yards, trees shot out and hung over our heads. I put off my under-coat and replaced it with my upper one, as I was soon immersed in a shower from the spray of the fall. We had got a line, intending to measure it, as I disputed the account I heard of its height. My companion winded round a hill, and with much intrepidity placed himself at the top, appearing to me at the bottom like a crow: he began to wind off, and we hallooed to one another; but we might as well have whispered; the tremendous bellowing of this vast surge suffered nothing to be heard but itself.

It might not be prudent, generally, to follow such an example in mountainous districts; yet, what he has done, ought to operate as an encouragement not to sink under common agricultural difficulties. Perhaps he has led the plough along steeper heights than has hitherto been done in this island. I have been told that the uprises of the roofs of many houses are about eight inches in the yard; and, judging of the ploughed parts of Latrig from the ascent of many roads, which is known occasionally to be five or six inches, he must have ploughed grounds as steep as the roofs of houses. Yet the surface of his steep mountain was alternately whitened with lime, or white with ripe grain. Lime could not be brought on these heights but by a winding road up the back of the mountain, then over its summit, and finally sledged down its brow. The rays of the afternoon sun( which are the hottest) shooting direct on the breast of the mountain, have ripened its grain more early than any I have seen this year. On the summit of Latrig is a pretty level plain, where the corn is some weeks behind, but where I was surprised to see eleven stacks standing of last year's grain.

I then said, I had the name of George the Third in my pocket, written by his own hand; and that if he would write, his name should stand on paper next the king.

I enquired at what age she might be supposed to learn to spin? and was answered, she had been spinning between ninety and one hundred years: yet the thread of life spins on. Her sight is good. On Sabbath Day last she was sitting in her chair: a pin was lying on the floor, and she took it up. Two years ago she was in company with a party of females: one of them was hemming a cap border: her small needle, with its small eye, wanted threading: her young friends were unsuccessful in the attempt; she ridiculed their want of dexterity, and taking the needle and the thread, threaded it without difficulty, and without spectacles, at one hundred and four.
