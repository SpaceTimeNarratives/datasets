The present licentious state of the press has, however, in a good measure destroyed this delicacy, and the self-interested tourist( as well as the factious politician) now finds his account, more in retailing personal anecdotes, and giving glimpses( however partial and imperfect) at living character, than in avowed purport of his title-page. When this practice terminates in censure, there is certainly something cruel in it, and when in praise, though well meant and morally right, it may nevertheless for many reasons give pain to the object. Partly from these consideration the author here foregoes a tempting opportunity to introduce a few pages into his work, which would stand a great chance, merely of themselves, to recommend the rest to public notice. For there are several men now living, born in the neighbourhood of the lakes, that for strength of genius, depth of learning, proficiency in arts, elegance of taste, and rectitude of understanding, are an ornament to their age and nation.
