A very happy thought, I declare: quite a beau id\u00e9e! You must know, Sir Charles, I have always several works in hand at the same time; and, as I always introduce a great deal of description of scenery in my romances, I keep that in my eye while I am travelling, and write a romance at the same time with my tours. It is only putting Geneva for Windermere, and, though I have never been abroad, I describe the scenery exactly as well as if I had been there. But I think I shall lay the scene of my next upon Derwent Water, make St. Herbert to have murdered a pilgrim, who shall turn out to be his brother, and I shall call it\" The Horrors of the Hermitage.\" I can introduce a mysterious monk of Borrowdale, and shall have fine opportunities of describing luxuriant groves and bowery lanes, in all the pomp of foliage of beech, birch, mountain-ash, and holly. It shall be a romance of the fourteenth century; and the castle upon Lord's Island shall be haunted by an armed head: and, I believe, Lydia, I shall draw my heroine from either you or myself, and make her passionately fon of drawing an botany; she shall be mistress of the Linnaean system, and then, if I should make her stop, in the midsst of her distresses, to admire the scenery, or gather a plant, it will be perfectly natural.","file_id":"1798_f","plnames":[["Windermere",348,358],["Derwent Water",511,524],["Borrowdale",698,708],["Lord's Island",931,944]],"geonouns":[["groves",768,774],["lanes",786,791],["mountain",837,845],["castle",919,925],["head",974,978]],"pos_words":[["happy",12,17],["works",107,112],["great",168,173],["well",432,436],["fine",725,729],["luxuriant",758,767],["heroine",1019,1026],["passionately",1067,1079],["admire",1225,1231],["perfectly",1275,1284]],"neg_words":[["mysterious",679,689],["mistress",1119,1127]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fourteenth century",887,909]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["abroad",390,396],["there",454,459]],"spa_preps":[["out",586,589]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0677966102,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974374771},{"para_id":266,"paragraph":"Linnaeus lived in the present century.","file_id":"1798_f","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["the present century",18,37]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9923573732},{"para_id":267,"paragraph":"Sample.
