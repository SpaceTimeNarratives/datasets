The windows of a whitewashed cottage wink over their garden wall, as the traveller comes up the slope, between tall hedge-rows; and very likely he will find all so still, that, but for wild birds that crowd the air with music, he could hear his footsteps ring on the hard road, as clearly as if he were walking on the flags of a gentleman's greenhouse. In summer time, when its buildings are glittering in their annual suit of new whitewash, and when all the country road looks green and glad, it is a pleasant spot to set eyes upon, - this quiet little hamlet overlooking the sea. All that time of year it smells of roses, and of\" cribs where oxen lie;\" and the place is so steeped in murmurs of the ocean, that its natural dreaminess seems deepened thereby.

The inhabitants would think the place busy with a dozen people upon its grass-grown road at once, whatever the season might be. It is true that on fine days in summer I have now and then seen a little life just at the entrance of the hamlet. There, stands a pretty cottage, of one storey, consisting of six cosy rooms, that run lengthwise; its white walls adorned with rose trees and fruit trees, and its widows bordered with green trellis work. Two trim grass-plats with narrow beds of flowers, and neat walks mosaically paved with blue and white pebbles from the sea, fill up the front garden, which a low white wall and a little green gate encloses from the road. In front of this cottage I have sometimes seen a troop of rosy children playing about a pale girl, who was hopelessly infirm, and, perhaps on that account, the darling of the household. I have seen her rocking in the sun, and with patient melancholy, watching the gambols of these merry children, whilst they strove to please her with all kinds of artless attentions. Poor Lucy! Sometimes, after swaying to and fro thoughtfully in her chair, she would stop and ask questions that sent her father out of the room to wipe his eyes. \" Papa, are people lame in heaven?\" \" Papa, are angels poorly sometimes, like we are here?\"** It is one of those beautiful compensations that mingle with the worst mishaps of life that such a calamity has often the sweet effect of keeping kind hearts continually kind. The poor Lancashire widow, when asked why she seemed to fret more for the loss of her helpless lad than for any of her other children, said she could n't tell, except it was\" because hooed had to nurse the poor thing moor nor o' tother put together.\" Surely\" there is a soul of god in all things evil.\" About this pretty cottage, where little Lucy lives, is the busiest part of the hamlet in summer time. There may chance to be two or three visitors sauntering in the sunshine; or, perhaps, old Thomas Smith, better known as\" Owd England,\" the sea-beaten patriarch of Norbreck, may paddle across the road to look after his cattle, or, staff in hand, he may be going down to\" low water\" a-shrimping, with his thin hair playing in the breeze. Perhaps Lizzy, the milkmaid, may run from the house to the shippon, with her skirt tucked up, and the neb of an old bonnet pulled down to shade her eyes; or Tom, the cow lad, may be leaning against a sunny wall, whistling, and mending his whip, and wondering how long it wants to dinner-time. There may be a fine cat dozing on the garden all, or gliding stealthily towards the outhouses, with dainty step, noiseless as a little cloud, and considering to herself whether this would be a likely time to surprise the mouse which slipped her in a certain corner of the barn yester-evening. These are the common features of life there. For the rest, the sounds heard are mainly the cackle of poultry, the clatter of milk cans, the occasional bark of a dog, the distant lowing of kine, a snatch of country song floating from the fields, the wild birds'\" tipsy routs of lyric joy,\" and that all-embracing murmur of the surge which fills one's ears wherever we go. In Norbreck everything smacks of the sea. On a grassy border of the road, about the middle of the hamlet, there is generally a pile of wreck waiting the periodical sale which takes place all along the coast. I have sometimes looked at this pile, and thought that perhaps to this or to that spar some seaman might have clung with desperate energy among the hungry waters, until he sank overpowered into his uncrowded grave. The walls of gardens and farm-yards are mostly built of cobles gathered from the beach, sometimes fantastically laid in patterns of different hues. The garden beds are edged with shells, and the walks laid with blue and white pebbles. Here and there are rockeries of curiously-shaped stones from the shore. Every house has its little store of marine rarities, which meet the eye on cornices and shelves wherever we turn. Now and then we meet with a dead sea-mew on the road; - and noisy flocks of gulls make fitful excursions landwards, parti - cularly in ploughing time, when they crowd after the plough to pick slugs and worms out of the new furrows.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Lancashire",1545,1555],["England",2066,2073]],"geonouns":[["road",154,158],["entrance",288,296],["hamlet",304,310],["cottage",335,342],["walls",420,425],["trees",444,449],["trees",460,465],["beds",549,553],["sea",635,638],["wall",684,688],["gate",708,712],["road",731,735],["cottage",754,761],["moor",1753,1757],["cottage",1857,1864],["hamlet",1918,1924],["sea",2080,2083],["road",2136,2140],["water",2215,2220],["house",2323,2328],["wall",2483,2487],["common",2877,2883],["country",3069,3076],["fields",3100,3106],["sea",3271,3274],["road",3302,3306],["hamlet",3332,3338],["coast",3435,3440],["waters",3597,3603],["walls",3661,3666],["farm",3682,3686],["beach",3738,3743],["beds",3816,3820],["stones",3941,3947],["shore",3957,3962],["house",3970,3975],["sea",4111,4114],["road",4126,4130]],"pos_words":[["fine",217,221],["pretty",328,334],["work",510,514],["neat",570,574],["rosy",795,799],["darling",897,904],["patient",968,975],["merry",1018,1023],["thoughtfully",1152,1164],["heaven",1294,1300],["like",1340,1344],["beautiful",1380,1389],["sweet",1482,1487],["pretty",1850,1856],["better",2045,2051],["breeze",2269,2275],["noiseless",2683,2692],["joy",3146,3149],["fantastically",3755,3768]],"neg_words":[["pale",825,829],["hopelessly",844,854],["infirm",855,861],["melancholy",976,986],["lame",1286,1290],["poorly",1322,1328],["worst",1425,1430],["calamity",1459,1467],["poor",1540,1544],["fret",1592,1596],["loss",1610,1614],["helpless",1622,1630],["poor",1742,1746],["evil",1832,1836],["cloud",2705,2710],["cackle",2954,2960],["wild",3112,3116],["wreck",3369,3374],["desperate",3563,3572],["dead",4106,4110],["noisy",4138,4143]],"events":[],"dates":[["the season",177,187],["days",222,226],["summer",230,236],["about a",817,824],["summer",1928,1934],["a fine",2583,2589],["the middle of the",3314,3331]],"times":[["evening",2854,2861]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",1352,1356],["there",1795,1800],["there",2901,2906],["there",3340,3345],["there",3901,3906]],"spa_preps":[["out",1233,1236],["together",1776,1784],["across",2125,2131],["down",2202,2206],["down",2407,2411],["against",2467,2474],["about",3308,3313],["along",3425,3430],["among",3580,3585],["into",3631,3635],["out",4286,4289]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0046838407,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":-0.986669302},{"para_id":11,"paragraph":"With a single exception, all the half - dozen dwellings in Norbreck are on one side of the road with their backs to the north. On the other side there are gardens, and a few whitewashed outhouses, with weather-beaten walls. The main body of the hamlet consists of a great irregular range of buildings, formerly the residence of a wealthy family. This pile is now divided into several dwellings, in some of which are snug retreats for such as prefer the seclusion of this sea-nest to the bustle of a great watering-place. A little enclosed lawn, belonging to the endmost of the group, and then a broad field, divides this main cluster from the only other habitation. The latter seems to stand off a little, as if it had more pretensions to gentility than the rest. It is a picturesque house, of different heights, built at different times. At the landward end, a spacious yard, with great doors close to the road, contains the outbuildings, which have an old-fashioned weather-vane on the top of them. The lowmost part of the dwelling is a combination of neat cottages of one storey; the larger and newer part is a substantial brick edifice of two storeys, with attics. This portion has great bow windows, which sweep the sea-view finely, from the coast of Wales, round by the Isle of Man, to the mountains of Cumberland. I summer time, the white walls of the cottage part are covered with roses and creeping plants, and there is an air of order and tasteful rusticity about the whole, even to the neat coble pavement which borders the wayside. On the top of the porch a stately peacock sometimes struts, like a spangled showman in front of a booth, whilst his mate paces to and fro, cackling on the field wall immediately opposite. There are probably a few poultry pecking about the front; and, if it happens to be a sunny day, a fine old English bearhound, of the Lyme breed, called\" Lion,\" and not so much unlike his namesake in the main, may be stretched in a sphynx-like posture on the middle of the road, as if the whole Fylde belonged to him by right of entail; and slowly moving his head with majestic gaze, as if turning over in his mind whether or not it would be polite to take a piece out of the passing traveller for presuming to walk that way. Perhaps in the southward fields a few kine are grazing and whisking their tails in the sunshine, or galloping from gap to gap impelled by the gad-fly's spur; and it may happen that some wanderer from Blackpool can be seen on the cliffs, with his garments flapping in the breeze. Except these, and the rolling surge below, all is still at this end of the hamlet, unless the jovial face of the owner appear above the wall that encloses his outbuildings, wishing the passer-by\" the fortune of the day.\" Norbreck, as a whole, is no painfully genteel in appearance, but it is sweet and serene, and its cluster of houses seems to know how to be comfortable, without caring much for display. Dirt and destitution are unknown there; in fact, I was told that this applies generally to all the scattered population of that quiet Fylde country. Though there are many people there whose means of existence are almost as simple as those of the wild bird and the field mouse, yet squalor and starvation are strangers amongst them. If any mischance happen to these Fylde folk, everybody knows everybody else, and, somehow, they stick to one another like Paddy's shrimps, - if you take up one you take up twenty. The road, which comes up thither from many a mile of playful meanderings through the green country, as soon as it quits the last house, immediately dives through the cliffs, with a sudden impulse, as if it had been reading\" Robinson Crusoe,\" and had been drawn all that long way solely by its love for the ocean. The sea-beach at this spot is a fine sight at any time, but in a clear sunset the scene is too grand to be touched by any imperfect words. Somebody has very well called this part of the coast,\" the region of glorious sunsets.\" When the waters retire, they leave a noble solitude, when a man may wander a mile or to north or south, upon a floor of sand finer than any marble,\" and yet no footing seen,\" except his own; nor any sounds heard mingling with the mysterious murmurs of the sea, but the cry of the wheeling gull, the piping of a flock of sliver-winged tern, or the scream of the wild sea-mew. Even in summer there are but few stragglers to disturb those endless forms of beauty which the moody waves, at every ebb, leave printed all over that grand expanse, in patterns ever new.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Wales",1256,1261],["Isle",1276,1280],["Cumberland",1309,1319]],"geonouns":[["road",91,95],["walls",217,222],["hamlet",245,251],["buildings",291,300],["residence",315,324],["sea",471,474],["lawn",539,543],["field",601,606],["house",784,789],["doors",888,893],["road",907,911],["cottages",1059,1067],["sea",1221,1224],["coast",1247,1252],["mountains",1296,1305],["walls",1346,1351],["cottage",1359,1366],["field",1699,1704],["wall",1705,1709],["road",2004,2008],["head",2090,2094],["fields",2282,2288],["gap",2372,2375],["gap",2379,2382],["hamlet",2611,2617],["wall",2672,2676],["houses",2865,2871],["country",3082,3089],["field",3206,3211],["road",3458,3462],["country",3545,3552],["house",3583,3588],["sea",3771,3774],["beach",3775,3780],["coast",3953,3958],["region",3965,3971],["waters",4003,4009],["sea",4250,4253],["sea",4360,4363]],"pos_words":[["great",266,271],["wealthy",330,337],["prefer",442,448],["great",499,504],["picturesque",772,783],["spacious",862,870],["great",882,887],["top",988,991],["neat",1054,1058],["great",1186,1191],["finely",1230,1236],["neat",1497,1501],["top",1551,1554],["stately",1570,1577],["like",1604,1608],["like",1970,1974],["right",2051,2056],["majestic",2100,2108],["polite",2173,2179],["breeze",2528,2534],["jovial",2630,2636],["fortune",2736,2743],["sweet",2828,2833],["serene",2838,2844],["comfortable",2896,2907],["quiet",3070,3075],["like",3391,3395],["playful",3507,3514],["love",3747,3751],["clear",3832,3837],["grand",3862,3867],["well",3924,3928],["glorious",3975,3983],["noble",4031,4036],["finer",4119,4124],["beauty",4447,4453],["grand",4519,4524]],"neg_words":[["irregular",272,281],["creeping",1399,1407],["slowly",2072,2078],["painfully",2785,2794],["destitution",2951,2962],["unknown",2967,2974],["wild",3188,3192],["starvation",3235,3245],["imperfect",3889,3898],["mysterious",4224,4234],["cry",4263,4266],["scream",4341,4347],["wild",4355,4359],["disturb",4416,4423],["moody",4464,4469]],"events":[],"dates":[["summer",1323,1329],["a sunny day",1815,1826],["a fine",1828,1834],["the middle of the",1986,2003],["the day",2747,2754],["a fine",3797,3803],["summer",4377,4383]],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile",3497,3503],["a mile",4069,4075]],"loc_advs":[["there",145,150],["there",1420,1425],["opposite",1722,1730],["southward",2272,2281],["above",2662,2667],["without",2909,2916],["there",2975,2980],["there",3098,3103],["there",3120,3125],["there",4384,4389]],"spa_preps":[["into",371,375],["close",894,899],["round",1263,1268],["about",1468,1473],["about",1773,1778],["over",2129,2133],["out",2196,2199],["below",2572,2577],["amongst",3260,3267],["through",3527,3534],["through",3608,3615],["over",4509,4513]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0527577938,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9979392886},{"para_id":12,"paragraph":"Such is little Norbreck as I have seen it in the glory of the year.

Knowing as little of these things as inland people generally do, I had something of the same expectation; but when I came to the coast, and found people going quietly about their usual business, I thought that, somehow, I must be wrong. It is true that one or two farmers had raised their stacks several feet, and another had sent his\" deeds\" to Preston, that they might be high and dry till the waters left his land again, and that certain old ladies who had been reading the newspapers, were a little troubled thereby; but, in the main, these seaside folk did n't seem afraid of the tide.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Preston",854,861]],"geonouns":[["coast",261,266],["streets",292,299],["water",374,379],["boats",386,391],["fields",417,423],["towers",460,466],["churches",470,478],["farm",495,499],["houses",500,506],["coast",637,642],["waters",904,910],["land",920,924]],"pos_words":[["great",333,338],["tops",487,491]],"neg_words":[["wrong",738,743],["troubled",1011,1019],["afraid",1079,1085]],"events":[],"dates":[["a bonny day",7,18],["March 1860",22,32],["a century previous",137,155]],"times":[],"distances":[["several feet",804,816]],"loc_advs":[["above",399,404],["left",911,915]],"spa_preps":[["into",221,225],["under",368,373],["about",675,680]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0102040816,"vader_sentiment":0.57,"roberta_sentiment":0.9967445135},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"During the two days when the sea was to reach its height, Blackpool was as gay, and the weather almost as fine, as if it had been the month of June, instead of\" March - mony weathers,\" as Fylde folk call it.

Not finding a deluge, they went landward again, with a painful impression that the whole thing was a hoax.

Leaning against one door-cheek, and sticking a knife into another, he said\" by gobs, did n't I get a fine pelting out o' that!** Do yees want any oysters, gentlemen? The shells is small,\" sad he, stepping forward,\" but theyere chock full o' the finest fish in the world. Divul a aiqual thim oysters has in the say, for flavour; mind I'm telling ye** Taste that!\" -\" Hollo, Dennis!\" said one of the company,\" how is it you are n't in Fleetwood?\" -\" Well, because I'm here, I suppose,\" said Dennis. \" Bedad, ye ca n't expect a man to be in two places at once - barring he was a burd. Maybe it's good fortune sent me here to meet wid a few daycent customers. Sorra one I met an the way, but rain powring down in lashins till the oyster in my basket begun to think they were in the say agin.\" -\" Well, Dennis,\" said the traveller,\" I'll have a score if you'll tell us about the Irishman in the cook's shop.\" \" Ye will? Then divul recave the toe I stir till ye get both!** Will you take another score, sir, till tell the tale? Its little chance ye'll have o' meeting them oysters agin - for theyere getting scarce. Oh, mothering forting,\" contnued he, putting down the basket,\" how that villain torments my poor bones this day! Many a time I was nigh chuckun it over the hedge, an sitting down on a shtone to shtarve right out, for its better to die aisy an' idle, than to be slaving to death for nothun. ** Begorra, see, there's a splendid oyster! That fellow's a mouthful for a king!** If it was n't for the fun an' the comfort there is in meeting wud rale gintlemin sometimes, Ied loose heart entirely. Things is quarely divided in this world. ** How An' - ever, since its no better, than God it's no worse. ** If I could meet wid a customer to buy the stock, an' the basket, an' the knife, at cost price, - Ied give him the goodwill an' the run o' the country for a pint o' porter, an' then Ied hurry to the nearest barracks, an' change my clothes. ** But, - now for the tale,\" said he, with his knife and his tongue in motion together. \" It was a man from Nenagh, in Tipperary - a kind o' ganger an the railway; an' he wint to a cook-shop in a teawn not far from this, an', ses he to the missis o' the heawse,' A basin o' pay-soop, ma' am, plaze,' - for, mind ye, an Irishman's naterally polite till he's vext, an' thin he's as fiery as Julius Sayzur. Well, whin she brought to soop, Paddy tuk a taste mighty sly; an' turning reawnt, ses he - just for spooart, mind - ses he,' Bedad, ma' am, your soop tastes mighty strong o' the water.' Well, av coorse, the woman was vext all out, an' she up an' tould him he did n't understand good aiting an' drinking, an' he might lave the soop for thim that had bin better eddicated. But bowld Paddy wint on widout losing a stroke o' the spoon; an' - purtinding not to hear her - ses he,' I'll go bail I'll make as good broth as thim wud a penny candle an' a trifle o' pepper.' Well, by gobs, this riz the poor woman's dander to thefull hoight, an she made right at him wid her fist, an' swore sheed knock him into the boiler. But Paddy was nigh finishing his soup, an' he made up his mind to take the last word: an' ses he,' Bi the powers! that'll be the best bit o' mate ever went into your pan, ma' am;' an' wi that, he burst into a laugh, an' the philandering rogue up an' towld her how he said it all for divarshun; an' divul a better soop he tasted in his life. Well, she changed her tune, like a child. By dad, it was like playing a piano or a flute, or something. An', mind ye, there's nothing like an Irishman for getting the right music out ov a woman - all the world over. So my tale's ended, an' Ied like to see the bottom o' my basket.

In a crowded city they might be unnoticed; but, amid\" the hamlet's hawthorn wild,\" where existence seems to glide as noiselessly as a cloud upon a summer sky, save where friendly gossips meet like a choir of crickets by some country fire, they are threads of vivid interest woven into the quiet tale of life; and, among their own folk they are prized something like those old books which people hand from generation to generation, - because they bear the quaint inscriptions of their forefathers. In my wandering I had also the benefit of a genial and intelligent companion; and whether we were under his own roof, among books and flowers, and fireside talk about the world in the distance, or roving the green lanes and coppice-trods, chatting with stray villagers by the way, or airing ourselves in the wind,\" on the beached margent of the sea,\" I found great pleasure and assistance in his society. My friend lives about a mile down the winding road from Norbreck, in a substantial hall, bult about a hundred years ago, a pleasantly dropt at the foot of a great natural embankment, which divides the low-lying plain from the sea. The house stands among slips of orderly garden, and plantation, with poultry yards and out-houses at the north-east end. The front of the house if flanked by two little groves of trees, and a tasteful, well-tended flower-garden slopes softly down to the iron railings which divide the garden from a great level field, across which a broad green walk leads to the gates at the highway side. The road is just far enough removed from the house to conceal the features of any passer by, and yet near enough for any familiar gait or figure to be discernible from the windows. From this road the sound of the postman's horn comes cheerily every forenoon, except on Sundays; and in summer, vehicles laden with visitors from Blackpool roll lazily along through the sunshine, on their way to Cleveless, Rossall, or Fleetwood. The green country, sparely sprinkled with white farm-houses and cottages, spreads out in front, far and wide, to where the fells of Lancashire bound the eastward view. The scene is as quiet as a country church just before service begins, except where the sails of a windmill are whirling in the wind, or the fleecy steam-cloud of a distant train gushes across the landscape, like a flying fountain of snow. On a knoll behind the house there is a little rich orchard, trimly hemmed in by thick thorn hedges. I have seen it when its shadeless walks were open to the sky, and all its holiday glory was brooding patiently down in the cold ground; but I remember how oft in summer, when the boughs were bending with fruit, and the leaves were so thick overhead that the sunshine could only find its way through chinks of the green ceiling, we have pushed the branches aside, and walked and talked among its bowery shades; or sitting on benches at the edge of the fish-pond, have read and watched our floats, and hearkened to the birds, until we have risen, as if drawn by some fascination in the air, and gone unconsciously towards the sea again. There we have spent many a glorious hour; and there, at certain times of the day we should meet with\" Quick.\" or\" Mitch,\" or some other coast-guardsman belonging to the gun-boat's crew at Fleetwood, pacing to and fro, on the look-out for Frenchmen, smugglers, and wreck. As we returned from the shore one afternoon, an old man was walking on the road before us, carrying what looked in the distance like two milk pails. These he set down now and then, and looked quietly around. My friend told me that this part of the Fylde was famous for singing birds, especially larks.

It stands on a knoll, about a quarter of a mile over the fields from Norbreck; and its foundation is of great antiquity. It appears that the Roman Catholic form of worship was celebrated in this church until the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne. Speaking of the time of the Reformation, the following passage occurs in Mr. Thornber's\" Penny Stone; or, a Tradition of the Spanish Armada;\" -\" Lancashire at this period was particularly torn by adverse parties; for while in other parts of the kingdom the new religion progressed rapidly, there it was retrograde; Romanists multiplied, the mass was commonly performed, priests were harboured, many churches shut up, and the cures unsupplied, except by the rejected. In the Foreland of the Fylde, local circumstances had increased the dissatisfaction, which had been chiefly excited by the dissemination of the infamous publications of Dr. Allen, a native of Rossall - the preaching of Campain and others, while in hiding at the Heskets' of the Maynes, Poulton, and at the Rigby's of Layton Hall - by the unjust election of Widow Allen and her daughter from Rossall Grange, before the expiration of their lease - its plunder and sacking - the constant repetition of acts of oppression - and finally, by the deprivation of Jeromine Allen, the respected cure of Bispham church, who from the smallness of his cure, and the insignificance of its yearly value, was probably screened from the notice of the reformers.\" The last time this Jeromine Allen officiated in Bispham church was on the 25th of March 1559. After the celebration of the mass, the old priest preached form the text\" Obey the powers that be, for they are ordained of God;\" and then, taking a solemn farewell of his congregation, he departed, to spend the remainder of his days at Lambspring, in Germany. The grave-yard at Bispham church contains some interesting memorials, but none more solemnly eloquent than a certain row of green mounds covering the remains of the unknown drowned washed upon that coast from time to time. Several of these, which drifted ashore after the burning of the Ocean Monarch off the coast of Wales, in 1848, now lie mouldering together in the quiet country churchyard, all unknown, save a lady from Bury, in Lancashire, to whose memory a tombstone is erected here.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Elizabeth",311,320],["Lancashire",481,491],["Grange",1202,1208],["Wales",2222,2227],["Lancashire",2338,2348]],"geonouns":[["parish",21,27],["church",28,34],["fields",143,149],["church",281,287],["churches",735,743],["church",1404,1410],["church",1605,1611],["church",1930,1936],["coast",2102,2107],["coast",2213,2218],["country",2279,2286]],"pos_words":[["interesting",60,71],["great",190,195],["celebrated",262,272],["excited",911,918],["cure",1388,1392],["cure",1442,1446],["celebration",1653,1664],["interesting",1951,1962],["eloquent",1997,2005],["quiet",2273,2278]],"neg_words":[["primitive",4,13],["object",72,78],["adverse",532,539],["rejected",793,801],["dissatisfaction",871,886],["infamous",947,955],["unjust",1141,1147],["plunder",1253,1260],["oppression",1310,1320],["insignificance",1456,1470],["solemn",1792,1798],["unknown",2069,2076],["burning",2176,2183],["lie",2242,2245],["unknown",2303,2310]],"events":[],"dates":[["yearly",1478,1484],["the 25th of March 1559",1619,1641],["his days",1868,1876],["1848",2232,2236]],"times":[["The last",1549,1557]],"distances":[["a quarter of a mile",114,133]],"loc_advs":[["there",626,631],["ashore",2159,2165],["here",2389,2393]],"spa_preps":[["about",108,113],["over",134,138],["together",2257,2265]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.023923445,"vader_sentiment":0.43,"roberta_sentiment":0.9946940541},{"para_id":57,"paragraph":"As the great tides declined, the weather began to be troubled with wintry fits, but when the day of my return came it brought summer again.

Within the fine sweep of scenery overlooking this bay, there is many a venerable home of ancient religion, many a towered steep and storied glen, that wakes the memories of a thousand years gone by. Morecambe is, also, the outfall of Windermere and Coniston waters, and is the most impressive gateway to the Lake Country. From its shore at Ulverstone, the River Leven will lead the traveller by windings full of changeful beauty, nine miles, to that pleasant resting place called\" Newby Bridge,\" at the foot of Windermere. Cartmel and Furness have been comparatively unknown, on account of difficulty of access in days gone by; but now that the line from Lancaster to Ulverstone skirts these sequestered regions, their attractions cannot fail to arrest the attention of all lovers of the picturesque in nature. In addition to its natural beauty, Furness is indeed\" a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayst dig brass;\" but the wild fells and green valleys of Cartmel know little of the bustling world, save what belongs to their purely agricultural and pastoral character; and the primitive mountain folk therein cling to the manners, language, and traditions of their\" fore-elders\" with an affection little disturbed by communion with the great changes of modern life. To the scholar and student of manners, to the lover of nature, and the man of science, these secluded hills and glens teem with rich and rare interest.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Morecambe",0,9],["Furness",73,80],["Cartmel",85,92],["Lancashire",110,120],["Lune",169,173],["Winster",189,196],["Kent",202,206],["Leven",212,217],["Morecambe",917,926],["Windermere",952,962],["Coniston",967,975],["Ulverstone",1058,1068],["River Leven",1074,1085],["Newby Bridge",1199,1211],["Windermere",1229,1239],["Cartmel",1241,1248],["Furness",1253,1260],["Lancaster",1373,1382],["Ulverstone",1386,1396],["Furness",1564,1571],["Cartmel",1699,1706]],"geonouns":[["bay",10,13],["bay",37,40],["districts",60,69],["waters",145,151],["rivers",229,235],["shores",349,355],["vales",397,402],["nooks",414,419],["towns",438,443],["villages",448,456],["parks",463,468],["woods",479,484],["water",500,505],["sea",611,614],["mountains",641,650],["bay",768,771],["glen",858,862],["waters",976,982],["shore",1049,1054],["windings",1113,1121],["foot",1221,1225],["line",1363,1367],["regions",1422,1429],["land",1585,1589],["stones",1596,1602],["hills",1630,1635],["valleys",1688,1695],["mountain",1831,1839],["hills",2112,2117],["glens",2122,2127]],"pos_words":[["great",23,28],["grand",255,260],["beauty",313,319],["charm",375,380],["soft",383,387],["rich",458,462],["charming",531,539],["like",556,560],["majesty",709,716],["fine",729,733],["impressive",1000,1010],["lead",1091,1095],["beauty",1140,1146],["pleasant",1168,1176],["picturesque",1506,1517],["beauty",1556,1562],["affection",1931,1940],["great",1980,1985],["modern",1997,2003],["lover",2056,2061],["rich",2138,2142]],"neg_words":[["crooked",29,36],["object",261,267],["lying",269,274],["irregular",339,348],["wild",474,478],["capricious",600,610],["stormy",702,708],["steep",840,845],["unknown",1285,1292],["difficulty",1308,1318],["fail",1456,1460],["wild",1667,1671],["primitive",1821,1830],["disturbed",1948,1957]],"events":[],"dates":[["a thousand years",891,907],["days",1332,1336]],"times":[],"distances":[["nine miles",1148,1158]],"loc_advs":[["there",773,778],["home",799,803]],"spa_preps":[["among",275,280],["about",571,576],["round",660,665],["over",688,692],["out",1617,1620]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0339805825,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987593889},{"para_id":64,"paragraph":"Before the railway was made, the old way of crossing the sand from Lancaster to Ulverstone must have been very striking, both from the character of the scenery around, and a sense of danger, which cannot but have given something of the piquancy of adventure to the journey. The channels are constantly shifting, particularly after heavy rains, when they are perilously uncertain. For many centuries past, two guides have conducted travellers over them. Their duty is to observe the changes, and find fordable points. In all seasons and states of the weather this was their duty, and in times of storm and fog it must have been fraught with danger. These guides were anciently appointed by the prior of Cartmel, and received synodal and Peterpence for their maintenance. They are now paid from the revenues of the duchy. The office of guide has been so long held by a family of the name of Carter, that the country people have given that name to the office itself. A gentleman, crossing from Lancaster, once asked if\" Carters\" were never lost on the sands. \" I never knew any lost,\" said the guide;\" there's one or two drowned no and then, but theyere generally found somewhere i' th bed when the tide goes out.\" A certain ancient mariner, called Nutall, who lives at Grange, on the Cartmel shore, told me that\" people who get their living by' following the sands,' hardly ever die in their beds. They end their days on the sands; and even their horses and carts are generally lost there. \" I have helped,\" said he\" to pull horses and coaches, aye, and guides too out of the sands. The channel,\" he continued\" is seldom two days together, in one place. You may make a chart one day, and, before the ink is dry, it will have shifted.\" I found, indeed, by inquiry, that those who have travelled the sands longest, are always most afraid of them; and that these silent currents, which shimmer so beautifully in the sunshine, have been\" the ribs of death\" to thousands. The old\" Over Sands\" route began at Hest Bank, a cliff on the shore, about three miles from Lancaster. The coach, and whatever travellers might be going, used to meet the guide on the banks of the River Keer, which runs over the sands, about three miles from Hest Bank. Here the guide carefully tried the bed of the stream before travellers were allowed to cross - for what was fordable yesterday to-day might be quicksand. The safe tracks are indicated by branches of furze, called\" brogs,\" stuck in the sand. The old word\" brog,\" means a broken branch; and it is very likely that the word\" brob,\" applied by the people of Furness and Cartmel to these furze branches, is merely a corruption of the former word. On reaching Kent's Bank, the coach went about three miles through the villages on the Cartmel shore, and then forward across the Leven estuary, to Ulverstone town. These sands, though not one third the distance of the sands between Lancaster and Kent's Bank are considered much more dangerous. Probably the difference may arise from the greater number of persons crossing from Cartmel to Ulverstone. In every village, and in almost every house I entered, upon the shores of this bay, I met with tales of danger and disaster which have occurred upon these sands; and even now there is a kind of daily excitement there, arising from the dangerous possibilities of travelling over them. Such was the old\" Over Sands\" route from Lancaster. In Mrs Hemans' letters she thus alludes to the journey; -\" I must not omit to tell you that Mr. Wordsworth not only admired our exploit in crossing the Ulverstone sands as a deed of' derring do,' but as a decided proof of taste. The lake scenery, he says, is never seen to such advantage as after the passage of what he calls its majestic barrier.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Lancaster",67,76],["Ulverstone",80,90],["Cartmel",702,709],["Lancaster",991,1000],["Grange",1267,1273],["Cartmel",1282,1289],["Lancaster",2057,2066],["River",2162,2167],["Furness",2589,2596],["Cartmel",2601,2608],["Kent",2689,2693],["Cartmel",2763,2770],["Leven",2806,2811],["Ulverstone",2824,2834],["Lancaster",2909,2918],["Kent",2923,2927],["Cartmel",3054,3061],["Ulverstone",3065,3075],["Lancaster",3402,3411],["Wordsworth",3509,3519],["Ulverstone",3565,3575]],"geonouns":[["railway",11,18],["channels",278,286],["points",509,515],["country",906,913],["sands",1049,1054],["bed",1183,1186],["shore",1290,1295],["sands",1357,1362],["beds",1390,1394],["sands",1423,1428],["coaches",1534,1541],["sands",1574,1579],["channel",1585,1592],["sands",1796,1801],["shore",2027,2032],["coach",2072,2077],["banks",2149,2154],["sands",2194,2199],["bed",2270,2273],["stream",2281,2287],["tracks",2398,2404],["coach",2706,2711],["villages",2747,2755],["shore",2771,2776],["estuary",2812,2819],["town",2835,2839],["sands",2847,2852],["sands",2895,2900],["village",3086,3093],["house",3115,3120],["shores",3141,3147],["bay",3156,3159],["sands",3232,3237],["sands",3576,3581],["lake",3646,3650]],"pos_words":[["striking",111,119],["helped",1497,1503],["silent",1858,1864],["beautifully",1892,1903],["safe",2393,2397],["excitement",3277,3287],["advantage",3691,3700],["majestic",3743,3751]],"neg_words":[["danger",183,189],["perilously",358,368],["uncertain",369,378],["fraught",627,634],["danger",640,646],["lost",1037,1041],["lost",1075,1079],["die",1377,1380],["lost",1476,1480],["afraid",1827,1833],["shimmer",1881,1888],["death",1944,1949],["stuck",2457,2462],["broken",2505,2511],["corruption",2646,2656],["dangerous",2960,2969],["danger",3181,3187],["disaster",3192,3200],["dangerous",3312,3321],["omit",3483,3487],["exploit",3541,3548]],"events":[],"dates":[["many centuries",384,398],["all seasons",520,531],["their days",1405,1415],["two days",1619,1627],["one day",1673,1680],["yesterday",2352,2361],["to-day",2362,2368],["daily",3271,3276]],"times":[],"distances":[["about three miles",2034,2051],["about three miles",2201,2218],["about three miles",2717,2734]],"loc_advs":[["past",399,403],["there",1099,1104],["somewhere",1167,1176],["there",1481,1486],["forward",2787,2794],["across",2795,2801],["between",2901,2908],["there",3252,3257],["there",3288,3293]],"spa_preps":[["around",160,166],["over",442,446],["out",1206,1209],["out",1563,1566],["together",1628,1636],["over",2185,2189],["through",2735,2742],["over",3350,3354]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0358126722,"vader_sentiment":-0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9963697195},{"para_id":65,"paragraph":"This impressive scene may now be traversed by all who prefer speed and ease to danger and delay, free from the uncertainties of the old route.

Over a few fields on the opposite side of the line is another of these border peels, called Heslop Tower. Delightful Arnside! If any man loves the beautiful in nature - if he be a geologist, or a botanist, or an invalid in search of peaceful restoration - let him wander about Arnside, and pleasant Silverdale - which is close by. Shortly after this evening ride I returned for a ramble about Arnside, one sunny day, in company with Mr. W. Salmon, F.G. s., president of the Horticultural Society of Ulverstone, and Mr. John Bolton of Swathmoor, a noble geologist, and a personal\" friend and fellow-labourer\" of professor Sedgwick. Mr. Bolton's disinterested ardour in the cause of science, his eminent knowledge of the geology of Furness and Cartmel, and his general characteristics, have justly won for him the name of\" the Hugh Miller of the north of England.\" The day was so fine, and the scene so beautiful, that we were blithe as three lads going a-nutting to the woods on a sunshiny holiday. The old station-master at Arnside knew the names of the hills around, and every remarkable point of the glorious landscape. We chatted with him a few minutes, watching the beautiful effect of a cloud-shadow gliding over the limestone crags of\" Whitbarrow\" in the sunlight; and, after begging a few matches, we lit our cigars, and took up a shady lane towards the hill called\" Arnside Knott.\" Having wound up this pleasant lane, between tall bushy hedgerows, about half a mile, we met a gamekeeper, who gave us directions for the ascent of the\" Knott,\" warning us against the use of fire, by which considerable damage had been done in the woods above. Skirting the eastern slope of the hill, a good road brought us into the vale at the head of which\" Arnside Tower,\" a massive old square building of limestone, stands, a lonesome, gloomy-looking ruin. It is finely situated on an isthmus which connects the two peninsulas of Arnside and Silverdale. Seaward, it commands a view of Warton Sands, and looks right over the bay, out to Peel Castle, off the far western point of Low Furness. Eastward, it overlooks the lone green vale of Arnside, with its little tarn shining in the hollow; and beyond there is a view of Farleton Knot, and of the sands formed by the River Keer. The walls of this ancient border stronghold are of great thickness, and the small rude windows. doorways, shot-holes, and quaint fire-places are still visible. There are no evidences of any other ancient outbuildings or defences connected with it, and, probably, as Dr. Whittaker says,\" It has been merely a place of temporary retreat, in case of sudden alarm from the north, for the neigbouring inhabitants.\" With the exception of an old farmhouse, a little below the tower, there is no other building in all the vale of Arnside. The old name of the township was\" Earnseat,\" from the\" earn,\" for which it was a favorite retreat in ancient times. The district, esoecially about the\" Knott,\" is famous for rare ferns, and the northern shore of that rocky height is a fovourite wandering ground of the geologist. Leaving the road on the slope of\" Arnside Knott,\" we walked through the old farmyard below, and thence up to the tower. Within, all was ruined, and wild, and roofless, but we found the winding limestone staircase sufficiently good for us to get to the top without difficulty. Here we sat down on the broad, grass-grown, ruined wall, to look about us. In spite of the beauty of the woods on\" Arnside Knot,\" the greenness of the vale, and the fine views east and west, there was a touch of desolation in the scene, to which the mouldering tower we sat upon contributed a solemn share. In the east a train laden with Furness ore darted by the end of the vale, and broke the dreamy stillness with remembrances of the active world. It passed, and all was still again, except where a number of swallows skimmed the air in graceful flight between our ruined resting-place and the ground. I chanced to fling some shreds of paper from the tower, which, as they were borne away in quivering gyrations by the wind, were instantly pursued by birds, and rarely reached the ground before they were caught by one or other of these dainty ariels, and carried off to nooks in the eaves of the old farmhouse below. One of my friends said it reminded him of the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties, and was another evidence of the growing taste for reading in these times. Another suggested that perhaps these Arnside swallows might inherit the souls of departed polititians, and were anxious to know something of the political movements of the day; and, pointing to a bird which dropped the shred he had caught in his bill, he said that one evidently did n't agree with the leading article, and therefore declined to take the paper in any further. Another thought that they might have heard of the dispute about the duty, or might be in some way interested n the consumption of the article. But rumblings of distant thunder warned us that we had far to go, so we came down the stairs of the ruined tower, and began the ascent of\" Arnside Knott.\" A good footpath leads aslant the hill, through groves of larch, spruce, and fir, whose different hues of green look very beautiful in the sunshine. About half way we left the footpath, and struck up the shingly hill-side to save time. The slope was steeper than an ordinary roof, and the shingles gave way at every step; but we toiled up, often using our hands, till we reached a green spot at the edge of the wood upon the summit. Here, among gorse bushes and tufts of ling, we found it pleasant to rest. The view was fine from this point. At the foot of the hill lay the lone valley of Arnside, with its hoary tower standing at the head, like a worn-out soldier dreaming of departed wars - and its silvery pool shining in the green hollow, the little bright eye of that silent dell. Over the fir-clad ridge beyond we had a charming glimpse of Silverdale, and its sequestered village near the sea. I understand that the sands on Silverdale shore are very fine for bathing. In this delightful dale there is a small lake called\" Hawes Tarn,\" crowded with pike, and remarkable for its thick bed of snow-white, tiny univalve sea-shells, of fragile beauty. The waters of this tarn are said to be affected by the rise and fall of the tide. The sun was shining all around, and we had a full view of\" Farleton Knott,\" and the picturesque limestone bridges running eastward. In a far corner of the Milnthorpe Sands, the white tower of Heversham church peeped out prettily from the green woods down by the shore; whilst in the east all the great Yorkshire hills were robed in gloom, and solemn rollings of distant thunder told that a storm was raging among them. It was a glorious sight; but cool gusts came now and then through the sunshine, and the trees on\" Arnside Knott\" began to talk of the coming tempest. Our old friend said that rain would certainly overtake us before the day had run by, and as a fir tree was but a riddly shelter in the heavy showers, we had better get nearer to the haunts of man. He pocketed his geological hammer, strung his strong wallet over his shoulder, and let on through scratchy brushwood, under the green shades that cover all the hill top, emerging on the northern slope, from whence the view of\" Whitbarrow,\" the shores and sands and channel of the Kent, and the distant mountains of Cumberland, is wonderfully fine. Descending to the water side, our old friend donned his spectacles, and took out his hammer again; and the two geologists wandered about the rocky shore in a trance of scientific delight, picking up many specimens interesting to them. One of these specimens I was requested to show to an eminent geologist in Manchester, whose name was familiar to them. We found some simple, substantial cheer at a little country inn, called the\" Fighting Cocks,\" near the river side. From this place we went westward a mile or so, then up the valley of the Winster to\" Castle Head,\" where we spent two pleasant hours in the house and grounds. From thence we crossed over\" Aggerslack,\" down into\" Lindal Lane,\" then up the opposite steep again, by way of\" Slack Farm,\" right over thr rocky summit of\" Hampsfell,\" descending into the town of Cartmel, where we took tea at the Cavendish Arms, the principal inn, which stands on the site of the ancient priory buildings, near the church. A seven mile walk in the gloaming through Cartmel park, by the woods of Holker, and partly over the Leven Sands, brought us to Ulverstone about ten at night, after twenty miles walk, just in time to get well wet by the storm which we had watched in the forenoon from the eastern edge of\" Arnside Knott.\" In spite of this, hardly ever had a more delightful ramble through a more finely-varied country than the one I had that day. After this passing notice of my excursion to Arnside, I will now return to my first ride to Ulverstone by rail.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Arnside",36,43],["Arnside",66,73],["Arnside",276,283],["Arnside",436,443],["Silverdale",458,468],["Arnside",552,559],["Ulverstone",658,668],["Bolton",683,689],["Sedgwick",780,788],["Bolton",794,800],["Furness",889,896],["Cartmel",901,908],["England",1012,1019],["Arnside",1183,1190],["Whitbarrow",1401,1411],["Arnside",1533,1540],["Arnside",1907,1914],["Arnside",2081,2088],["Silverdale",2093,2103],["Warton",2136,2142],["Peel",2187,2191],["Castle",2192,2198],["Furness",2233,2240],["Arnside",2288,2295],["Farleton

after the train leaves Arnside station, the great bay begins to shew itself as we rumble over the fine viaduct that crosses the River Kent, and the yellow sand of its estuary spread out on each hand. One of my fellow-travellers pointed to a lonely stork standing quietly in the midst of the sandy waste, like some weird genius of the solitude. On the other side, near the embankment, the\" Old John,\" the oldest trading vessel of Morecambe bay, was ashore. The low slopes near the line are richly wooded with light-hued larch, and spruce, and fir, mingling beautifully with dark green yew trees. The line now clips the rocky shore for about a mile, and we are rolling over the little River Winster, one of the boundary lines of Lancashire and Westmorland; but, like the rest of these waters in Morecambe bay, so changeful in its course over the sands, that yon pretty island, a little way from the shore, which looks\" as quiet as a spot of sky among the evening clouds,\" has been known to be first in Lancashire, then in Westmorland, and back again in Lancashire, all in a month's time, through the caprice of this little Winster, which, when the fit is on it, thus plays at hide-and-seek with the two counties. The scenery richens as we roll along. The grand bay on one side, on the other picturesque rocks and snatches of woodland, sloping to the shore, with the wild fells behind, all going by in panoramic flight. It was about low water: the sun was setting, and all that great marine wilderness, beyond which the retired sea was out of sight - if a long line of golden light, far off, had not told its whereabouts - that sandy expanse was so still that, but for here and there a stranded boat, and a smack left aslant on the shore in the distance, it might have been a sea-beach belonging to some world unknown to man. This threshold of the mighty sea, where its children come to play, and on which so many suns have looked the grand farewell of day was once more lighted with a glory which made the pomp of man seem poor.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Arnside",28,35],["River Kent",133,143],["Morecambe",434,443],["River",688,693],["Winster",694,701],["Lancashire",732,742],["Westmorland",747,758],["Morecambe",798,807],["Lancashire",1005,1015],["Westmorland",1025,1036],["Lancashire",1056,1066],["Winster",1126,1133]],"geonouns":[["train",15,20],["station",36,43],["bay",55,58],["viaduct",108,115],["estuary",172,179],["bay",444,447],["slopes",469,475],["line",485,489],["trees",593,598],["line",604,608],["shore",629,634],["lines",723,728],["waters",788,794],["bay",808,811],["sands",849,854],["island",872,878],["shore",902,907],["rocks",1306,1311],["shore",1353,1358],["water",1439,1444],["sea",1530,1533],["line",1563,1567],["boat",1697,1701],["shore",1734,1739],["sea",1778,1781],["beach",1782,1787],["sea",1857,1860]],"pos_words":[["great",49,54],["fine",103,107],["like",309,313],["genius",325,331],["richly",494,500],["beautifully",561,572],["like",765,769],["pretty",865,871],["quiet",925,930],["picturesque",1294,1305],["panoramic",1404,1413],["great",1480,1485],["golden",1571,1577],["mighty",1850,1856],["grand",1937,1942],["glory",1988,1993]],"neg_words":[["lonely",246,252],["waste",302,307],["weird",319,324],["dark",578,582],["rocky",623,628],["wild",1369,1373],["smack",1709,1714],["unknown",1812,1819],["poor",2026,2030]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",389,393],["a month",1075,1082],["day",1955,1958]],"times":[["the evening",954,965],["The grand bay",1254,1267]],"distances":[["about a mile",639,651]],"loc_advs":[["ashore",453,459],["near",476,480],["here",1671,1675],["there",1680,1685],["left",1715,1719]],"spa_preps":[["over",94,98],["out",187,190],["near",368,372],["over",672,676],["over",840,844],["among",948,953],["through",1091,1098],["along",1247,1252],["behind",1380,1386],["about",1429,1434],["beyond",1505,1511],["out",1538,1541]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0366492147,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.998177886},{"para_id":71,"paragraph":"The valley, on the right hand, through which the Winster flows, is a beautiful scene. The level plain, enclosed by an irregular semicircle of hills, is all land reclaimed from the sea at different times. More than four hundred acres have been added to this reclamation by the new railway line. A remarkable conical hill, thickly clothed with wood, rises form the plain, in an isolated way. This singular height is called\" Castle Head,\" anciently,\" Atterpile Castle.\" There is a quaint mansion in a secluded part of the grounds, and\" if ever there was a house with a story, that looks like one.\" The sea formerly washed round the hill, and, as the old mariner at Grange told me,\" t must have been a capital place for smuggling in those days.\" \" Castle Head\" is supposed to have been a Roman settlement, or outpost of some kind, from the discovery of coins, ornaments, and other articles of Roman workmanship. About sixty years ago many curious articles were found there, among which were parts of a human skull, ver - tebrae, etc., teeth of buffaloes, tusks of boar, pieces of limestone, resembling hen's eggs; rings of blue ragstone, lead, clay, and glass; ninety - five sticas of Northumbrian kings, seventy - five Roman coins, a stone, supposed to have been a mould for casting silver rings; iron ore, petrified bore, pebbles, impressions of clay, pottery, or bone, and other ancient relics. This looks as if\" Castle Head\" was a place of many strange stories, which have drifted into the misty past to return no more. The tenantless hall of\" Castle Head\" stands amongst woods and gardens at the rearward base of this lonely looking height. The sole inhabitants of the place, at present, consist of a Scotch gardener and his family. When I visited the spot, with my two scientific friends, we wandered some time before we met with\" Sandy,\" till, at last, by dint of shouting - which seemed to hush into wistful stillness the lonely woods around - we roused him from one of the hot-houses. He led us through the echoing rooms of the empty mansion, up to the roof, from which we had a good view of the gardens and grounds. After this we ascended, by circuitous paths and rocky bemossed steps, terrace after terrace to the shady plateau upon the summit of this singular hill, which certainly is suggestive of a deserted encampment. I could imagine any of the races which have had mastery in Britain occupying that commanding eminence. The views over the bay, from embowered seats and recesses on the southern edge, are very beautiful. Obliging\" Sandy\" was full of simple earnestness about ferns and flowers.

They eyed me from head to foot, wondering where I came from, and what I had to do with their hills and dales, at last settling in their minds that I must be a strange land-surveyor, preparing for fresh changes in that part of the country. I think the old landlord himself began to be puzzled, for, beckoning to a stalwart young man, who stood down in the village-street with a bundle of papers in his hand, he said -\" That's the man for ye. He's read a deeal o' books. He knaas summat abaat ivvery thing, nearly; an' he knaas mair abaat Grange, I sud think, than onybody in it.\" I found him an enthusiastic entomologist and ornithologist, and a very unassuming, intelligent man, of manly manners. We sat down in the Crown chatting, and listening whilst\" Aad Blly,\" a blind fiddler, who lives by scattering music among the folk of Cartmel Fells, played\" Scots wha hae w' Wallace bled,\" and\" Bannocks o' bear meal, bannocks o' barley.\" The old man beat time with hs foot, and accompanied his instrument with a curious croon, which made up in quaintness for what it lacked in harmony. I could not help thinking, as he sat there, that a country village without a blind fiddler is wanting in a valuable feature of human interest. Leaving\" Aad Billy\" at the end of\" Over Bogie,\" my friend proposed that we should go to the top of\" Yewbarrow,\" the hill at the rear of th village, from the summit of which he said the views were magnificent. As we went out at the head of the village by a shady road, he opened the gate of a small enclosed knoll, on the right hand, saying,\" Stop; my workshop is in here. We'll peep at it, if you like, before we go up.\" In the centre of this enclosure there was a rude, round hut, built of limestone, something like a large summer-house. On entering, I found myself in a little museum, filled with strange birds, and carefully arranged glass-cases of rare shells and insects. Against the wall hung a broken skeleton head and horns of the Irish elk, which had been found in the neighbouring sands, a few years ago. In one corner was reared a large slab of red sandstone, from Storton, in Cheshire, on which were plainly imprinted the footsteps of some antediluvian creature; he thought it was the plesiosaurus. The place was full of curiosities; and I noticed a live wood-owl, in a cage outside, with its large, lustrous eyes, blinking in the sunshine. Leaving this little sanctum of science, we went through the shady grounds of\" Yewbarrow Lodge,\" and thence, by rocky, sinuous paths to the summit of Yewbarrow. This hill takes its name from the yew tree, for the growth of which it is remarkable, and from\" barrow,\" a cairn or burial place. Here I was glad to sit down and look round, for I was out of wind, and the view had grown grander as we rose. Morecambe and a great extent of its shores were full in sight, the slopes and lowlands all beauty and fertility, all above and in the distance wild and majestic. My friend told me that, on a favourable day, the town of Lancaster was almost as distinctly in sight as the houses at the foot of the hill; but he surprised me more by saying that the ivy-clad limestone rocks upon the summit of Yewbarrow were unmistakably water-worn, that is, worn by the action of the sea. The village lay under the eye, as clearly as a map or model on a table. We could see all its houses, perching or nestling picturesquely among straggling gardens and nooks of bloomy shade. We could see all its mansions, with their rich grounds, and woods now spreading out the bright green of spring in the sunshine; its white roads and bye lanes, winding through orchards, and under over-lapping trees, about the green knolls and dingles, and lacing the land with lines of ever-varying loveliness. Grange is no less pleasant in its own quiet beauty, and in the scenery about it, than in the salubrity of its climate, which is said to rival that of the southern coast of England. In spring, its average temperature is higher than that of any other place in the north of England. In summer, the heat is tempered by the saline breeze. Beautifully seated on the slope of Yewbarrow, it is sheltered on the north and west by the green hills, and its natural charms are heightened by the never-palling witcheries of the changeful sea. Artists, and other curious children of nature, who love to go about the world find its neighbourhood full of interest. It was a beautiful sight; and, as I descended the hill by another route, to meet the train, I resolved that, if possible, it should not be long before I looked upon the peaceful nest again.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Grange",701,707],["Cartmel",994,1001],["Yewbarrow",1489,1498],["Cheshire",2277,2285],["Yewbarrow",2620,2629],["Yewbarrow",2691,2700],["Morecambe",2942,2951],["Lancaster",3161,3170],["Yewbarrow",3332,3341],["Grange",3910,3916],["England",4082,4089],["England",4181,4188],["Yewbarrow",4279,4288]],"geonouns":[["ground",36,42],["bay",81,84],["hills",93,98],["head",182,186],["foot",190,194],["hills",257,262],["dales",267,272],["land",331,335],["country",394,401],["village",519,526],["street",527,533],["foot",1128,1132],["country",1297,1304],["village",1305,1312],["top",1481,1484],["hill",1505,1509],["village",1528,1535],["summit",1546,1552],["head",1620,1624],["village",1632,1639],["road",1651,1655],["gate",1671,1675],["house",1921,1926],["wall",2078,2082],["head",2106,2110],["sands",2180,2185],["wood",2456,2460],["grounds",2608,2615],["paths",2668,2673],["summit",2681,2687],["hill",2707,2711],["tree",2740,2744],["shores",2978,2984],["slopes",3009,3015],["town",3153,3157],["houses",3212,3218],["foot",3226,3230],["hill",3238,3242],["rocks",3307,3312],["summit",3322,3328],["water",3360,3365],["sea",3407,3410],["village",3416,3423],["table",3477,3482],["houses",3505,3511],["nooks",3577,3582],["mansions",3621,3629],["grounds",3647,3654],["woods",3660,3665],["roads",3738,3743],["lanes",3752,3757],["winding",3759,3766],["trees",3808,3813],["land",3866,3870],["lines",3876,3881],["coast",4073,4078],["slope",4270,4275],["hills",4341,4346],["sea",4435,4438],["hill",4609,4613],["train",4644,4649]],"pos_words":[["fresh",360,365],["beckoning",462,471],["enthusiastic",758,770],["intelligent",826,837],["harmony",1237,1244],["valuable",1353,1361],["magnificent",1585,1596],["right",1710,1715],["like",1786,1790],["like",1901,1905],["lustrous",2501,2509],["remarkable",2776,2786],["glad",2843,2847],["great",2958,2963],["beauty",3033,3039],["majestic",3094,3102],["clearly",3446,3453],["rich",3642,3646],["bright",3688,3694],["loveliness",3898,3908],["pleasant",3928,3936],["quiet",3948,3953],["beauty",3954,3960],["breeze",4236,4242],["love",4491,4495],["beautiful",4568,4577],["peaceful",4728,4736]],"neg_words":[["strange",323,330],["puzzled",448,455],["blind",931,936],["lacked",1227,1233],["blind",1323,1328],["shady",1645,1650],["rude",1854,1858],["strange",1988,1995],["hung",2083,2087],["broken",2090,2096],["shady",2602,2607],["rocky",2653,2658],["wild",3085,3089],["worn",3366,3370],["worn",3381,3385],["rival",4046,4051]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of",1412,1422],["summer",1914,1920],["a few years ago",2187,2202],["a favourable day",3131,3147],["spring",3704,3710],["spring",4094,4100],["summer",4193,4199]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1283,1288],["without",1313,1320],["here",1755,1759],["there",1842,1847]],"spa_preps":[["about",12,17],["about",157,162],["down",507,511],["down",868,872],["among",976,981],["out",1609,1612],["round",1860,1865],["outside",2476,2483],["through",2590,2597],["down",2855,2859],["round",2869,2874],["out",2886,2889],["above",3059,3064],["under",3428,3433],["among",3548,3553],["out",3680,3683],["through",3767,3774],["under",3789,3794],["over",3795,3799],["about",3815,3820],["about",3981,3986],["about",4502,4507]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0249433107,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9905582666},{"para_id":88,"paragraph":"The grandest height near Grange is Hampsfell, at the rear of Yewbarrow. Whosoever desires to see that country well, ought to ascend Hampsfell, at sunrise or sunset, on a fine day, and he may look upon a scene of such magnificence as is rarely met with in any land. For those who are not strong, a carriage road leads up the south side of Eggerslack Wood, nearly to the summit of the fell; but the sturdy pedestrian should go out at the lower end of Grange, and up the narrow romantic glen, called\" Lindal Lane,\" till he comes to a farmhouse called\" Slack,\" on the left hand side of the road. The shady gorge is a little fairy-land of woodland beauty in summer time. After crossing the yard of Slack farm, a rough footpath leads up through plantations of larch and spruce, and coppice woods of oak and hazel, sprinkled, now and then, with the glittering birch - that silver-robed lady of the woods - the beech, the ash\" for nothing ill,\" the alder, and the dark green yew,\" obedient to the bender's will.\" These woods, which are carefully cultivated for\" bobbin wood,\" hoops, wicker-work and other purposes, are great sources of employment to the people around. As the traveller winds through the sylvan scene, by changeful pleasure upward led, he meets with glimpses of the sea, gleaming through the southward trees; and there is many a nook of the mountain path where he may sit in cool shadow, listening to the wild birds which fill the woods with their tuneful joy. Emerging from this leafy screen, he finds rocky, unshaded moorlands, stretching upwards in silent desolation. Picturesque masses of limestone crop out from the heathery waste, their ragged crevices beautiful with plumy ferns. There is still a rude pathway to the summit, but for a good walker, what country folk call\" The Crow Gate,\" which means right a-head, across the trackless moor will be more interesting. At length, the top of a square, limestone appears on the distant height. This is\" Hampsfell Hospice,\" a modern erection, built by a former pastor of Cartmel parish, for the shelter and entertainment of wanderers over the fell. As he draws nearer this little benevolent coronet of lonely Hampsfell, mountain and vale, and land and sea, expand so gloriously, that he cannot but halt now and then to gaze around with wonder and delight. Inside the tower there are stone seats, and a good fireplace, for which the heather around affords ready and abundant kindling.

In the south, over Arnside, Silverdale, and Warton, we have the fells and green lowlands of the Lancaster side; ridge after ridge then hides the Lune and the Wyre till the masts and lighthouse of Fleetwood shew themselves far out to seaward. If the day be fine, the mountains of Wales, the Isle of Man, and even the coast of Ireland may sometimes be seen. It is a glorious combination of land and sea; but, perhaps, the most charming bit of all the landscape is the valley of Cartmel, just at the western foot of Hampsfell.

Camden says of the district, that\" in 677, Egfrid, King of Northumbria, gave St. Cuthbert the land, and all the Britons in it.\" \" In 1188,\" according to Baines,\" the foundation of a priory for canons regular of St. Augustine was laid by William Mareschal, the elder, Earl of Pembroke.\" His charter concludes with these words: -\" This house I have founded for the increase of our holy religion, giving and granting to it every kind of liberty that heart can conceive, or mouth utter; and whoever shall in any way infringe upon these immunities, or injure the said priory, may he incur the curse of God, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and all other saints, as well as my particular malediction.\" This priory was enriched by many grants and donations of pontiffs and princes, and many\" offerings of the faithful.\" The town is situated in a vale watered by two streams, one running north and the other south. Between these streams stands the fine old conventual hall, with its curious belfry rising from the central tower, a square inscribed within a square, diagonal to its base. Of course, there is a tradition connected with the foundation of Cartmel Priory. It seems that nearly seven hundred years ago, a number of foreign monks, wondering about the country in search of a settlement, somehow found their way into this, then, dense forest wild. They were preparing to build their church upon a hill-top in the neighbourhood, when a voice spoke to them of of the air, saying:\" Not there; but in a valley between two rivers, where one runs north and the other south.\" It seems unfortunate that the voice should neglect to tell them where that valley was, as they happened to be so near it at the time. But it was so; for these homeless fathers wandered, after that, all over the north of England, in fruitless search, until they found the place, at last, near the very hill where they first heard\" the voice in the air.\" Here, on an island of hard ground between these singular streams, they built the Priory of Cartmel, and dedicated it to St. Mary. They also built a small chapel on the hill, where they heard the voice, and they dedicated it to St. Bernard. The chapel is now gone, but the hill is called\" St. Bernard's Mount\" to this day.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Cartmel",7,14],["Grange",121,127],["Lancashire",230,240],["Grange",461,467],["Cartmel",497,504],["Kent",847,851],["Cartmel",903,910],["Cartmel",926,933],["Cuthbert",1051,1059],["Cartmel",2109,2116],["England",2754,2761],["Cartmel",2978,2985],["Mount",3189,3194]],"geonouns":[["market",20,26],["town",27,31],["district",51,59],["hills",155,160],["church",220,226],["parish",351,357],["church",358,364],["church",381,387],["town",431,435],["waters",587,593],["village",836,843],["district",989,997],["land",1064,1068],["house",1304,1309],["mouth",1440,1445],["town",1782,1786],["vale",1804,1808],["streams",1824,1831],["streams",1886,1893],["hall",1925,1929],["tower",1979,1984],["country",2218,2225],["forest",2300,2306],["church",2348,2354],["hill",2362,2366],["valley",2464,2470],["rivers",2483,2489],["valley",2609,2615],["hill",2835,2839],["island",2899,2905],["ground",2914,2920],["streams",2944,2951],["chapel",3041,3047],["hill",3055,3059],["chapel",3131,3137],["hill",3159,3163]],"pos_words":[["pleasant",132,140],["noble",180,185],["well",369,373],["famous",476,482],["great",544,549],["attraction",550,560],["celebrated",598,608],["cure",617,621],["benefit",892,899],["great",953,958],["holy",1349,1353],["liberty",1404,1411],["well",1625,1629],["faithful",1767,1775],["fine",1905,1909],["top",2367,2370],["dedicated",2991,3000],["dedicated",3098,3107]],"neg_words":[["dissolution",276,287],["liable",732,738],["infringe",1482,1490],["injure",1517,1523],["curse",1558,1563],["dense",2294,2299],["wild",2307,2311],["unfortunate",2543,2554],["neglect",2577,2584],["fruitless",2766,2775],["hard",2909,2913]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine day",164,174],["a fine",508,514],["spring",525,531],["the summer months",564,581],["many years",659,669],["annual",811,817],["1188",1103,1107],["hundred years",2152,2165],["this day",3199,3207]],"times":[],"distances":[["more than two miles",92,111],["About three miles",403,420]],"loc_advs":[["past",670,674],["here",865,869],["within",2005,2011],["there",2055,2060],["there",2448,2453],["near",2821,2825]],"spa_preps":[["over",146,150],["about",441,446],["near",860,864],["about",2208,2213],["into",2277,2281],["between",2471,2478],["near",2647,2651],["over",2736,2740],["between",2921,2928]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0225806452,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987471104},{"para_id":95,"paragraph":"Going form a crowded city into this little monastic town is almost like going to bed, or sinking into an antiquarian dream, - all is so quaint and quiet.

I found the place filled with a very cheerful smell; and, in a few minutes, I got so thick with the woodcutters, who were waiting for their evening meal, that I was invited to join them at a great dish of\" lobscouse,\" prepared by the handsome, good tempered landlady.

We finished off with oatcake, and butter and cheese, with a glorious dish of crisp water-cresses - the whole seasoned with a good deal of hearty fun, which is not the worst part of the best meal a man can eat. From this house the landlord directed me to an old building, occupied as a saddler's shop, in the opposite corner of the square.

The town is pleasantly situated in a vale, on the shores of the Leven estuary, among the hills of Low Furness; and it stands at convenient distances from so many points of interest, that I took up headquarters at the well-known Sun Hotel, in the market-place. From hence I made daily excursions into the neighbourhood; and one of my first rambles was to Swathmoor, about a mile from the town. Swathmoor Hall was, for many years, the residence of George Fox, founder of the Society of Friends. Leaving Ulverstone by the south road, about two hundred yards past the railway station, a bye-path leads over the fields on the right hand a little way, then down into a shady dell, through which a clear rivulet plays its moody music, running out of sight again at the south end, under thick low-lapping branches, which gaze into it and dally with its silvery ripples, as if in live with this limpid minstrel, whose song softens into silence in the woods beyond. This quiet dell is a fairy chapel of sylvan beauty, where the ceaseless hymn of nature is seldom disturbed by other sounds. In the deepest part of the hollow, and old tone bridge, shaded by tall trees, crosses the stream; from thence a rugged footpath climbs the opposite fields, and in about a quarter of a mile, leads close by the rear of a hoary pile of stone outhouses, or rude appearance. The road may be miry, but whoever he be that goes that way, in rain or fair weather, let him linger there a breathing while, for the old house in front of these buildings is Swarthmore Hall, the residence of George Fox. On my first visit, I wandered about some time before I could find any human creature astir. A contemplative charm seems to lie upon all around. The house is a large, irregular, Elizabethan building, with nothing grand about it, save the impressive memories of the great reformer who dwelt in it two centuries ago. The doorways are small; some of the windows are built up; and it has altogether a bald appearance, considering its size and former importance. But the home of the persecuted puritan still looks over those quiet fields with a kind of ascetic solemnity, as if it was mingling dreams of the past with a patient waiting for the result of slow decay. I wandered about the rough, cattle-trodden yard, among mire, and straw, and farming-gear, yet all was still, except a few ducks dabbling in a muddy pool, and a peaceful dog that roamed about outhouses, regardless of my presence. There was no sign of life even about the windows. At last, I came to a kind of kitchen at the rear of the hall, where I found the mistress of the house and her servants, throng at their washing. When I had explained the purpose of my visit, the mistress pointed to a rude gate at the end, which opened to the front of the hall. I went through and found myself in a little green paddock, where there was not even one rose left\" to mark where a garden had been.\" There, were the principal windows, - one little window looking out from George Fox's study; the other two were old-fashioned bay windows, much larger. From the uppermost of these windows Fox used to preach, sometimes, to his friends in the garden below. Near the bay window is the little old doorway, to which two rude stone steps lead up. All else was plain and unpretending; and all other windows in the lower part of the frontage were built up. Inside, I was shewn the\" hall,\" a quaint, flagged apartment, on the ground floor, with a great old-fashioned fire-place, and a kind of stone dais in the recess of the mullioned window. Here, I was told, the earliest meetings of the\" Friends\" were held. From this room, two steps led up to the little sanctuary which was Fox's study; and I felt as if every footfall there was an intrusion; for that dim-lighted room, with its tiny lattice and quaint furniture, was the cell of a saint,\" of whom the world was not worthy.\" His bed has been removed from its ancient apartment into a room where the farm servants sleep; and I was told that his Bible is now in the posses - sion of a lady belonging to the society of Friends, in Ulverstone. Before Fox married this pious widow of Judge Fell, he was once dragged from this house and imprisoned all night in Ulverstone, under guard of fifteen men, some of whom were perched in the fire-place, for fear he should fly up the chimney, and so escape. From thence he was removed to Lancaster Castle, where he suffered a long imprisonment. George Fox seemed to have turned Ulverstone and the country about it upside down in those days, preaching in all sorts of pulpits and private houses, and sometimes in the open market-place. He was once shamefully maltreated in the churchyard of St. Mary's, at Ulverstone, after preaching to the congregation there. About a quarter of a mile west of the hall there is a plain substantial chapel, - the first chapel of the disciples of George Fox, - built at his own cost, in 1688. It stands in a little flagged enclosure, surrounded by a stone wall about nine feet high. The white door of the yard was open when I saw it, and the\" Friends\" were met within, - yet there was no sound, but that of the sea-breeze whistling over the fields of Swathmoor. Above the entrance was this inscription, plainly graven,\" Ex dono, G. F., 1688.\" At the western end of the chapel there is a croft, which was presented with the chapel, for the accommodation of the horses of such Friends as came from a distance.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Ulverstone",12,22],["Leven",179,184],["Furness",217,224],["George",561,567],["Ulverstone",616,626],["George",1673,1679],["George",3107,3113],["Ulverstone",4207,4217],["Ulverstone",4334,4344],["Lancaster Castle",4503,4519],["George",4560,4566],["Ulverstone",4593,4603],["Ulverstone",4820,4830],["George",4994,5000]],"geonouns":[["country",31,38],["road",71,75],["station",85,92],["town",119,123],["vale",152,156],["shores",165,171],["estuary",185,192],["hills",204,209],["points",277,283],["market",361,367],["town",502,506],["residence",548,557],["road",640,644],["railway",679,686],["station",687,694],["path",702,706],["fields",722,728],["dell",784,788],["woods",1057,1062],["dell",1082,1086],["chapel",1098,1104],["hollow",1222,1228],["bridge",1243,1249],["trees",1266,1271],["stream",1285,1291],["fields",1343,1349],["stone",1428,1433],["road",1469,1473],["house",1602,1607],["buildings",1626,1635],["residence",1660,1669],["house",1833,1838],["building",1874,1882],["fields",2210,2216],["hall",2680,2684],["house",2720,2725],["gate",2846,2850],["hall",2896,2900],["bay",3160,3163],["bay",3298,3301],["stone",3354,3359],["hall",3508,3512],["ground",3551,3557],["stone",3618,3623],["bed",4008,4011],["farm",4078,4082],["house",4300,4305],["country",4612,4619],["houses",4702,4708],["market",4736,4742],["hall",4913,4917],["chapel",4947,4953],["chapel",4967,4973],["stone",5097,5102],["wall",5103,5107],["door",5140,5144],["sea",5258,5261],["fields",5288,5294],["entrance",5319,5327],["chapel",5416,5422],["chapel",5470,5476]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",102,113],["pleasantly",127,137],["convenient",243,253],["well-known",332,342],["leads",707,712],["right",736,741],["clear",806,811],["quiet",1076,1081],["beauty",1115,1121],["leads",1385,1390],["fair",1536,1540],["charm",1793,1798],["grand",1897,1902],["impressive",1922,1932],["great",1949,1954],["quiet",2204,2209],["patient",2299,2306],["peaceful",2505,2513],["lead",3366,3370],["quaint",3517,3523],["great",3572,3577],["led",3762,3765],["quaint",3925,3931],["saint",3961,3966],["worthy",3995,4001],["breeze",5262,5268]],"neg_words":[["shady",778,783],["moody",830,835],["disturbed",1168,1177],["rude",1448,1452],["lie",1808,1811],["irregular",1851,1860],["slow",2333,2337],["decay",2338,2343],["rough",2366,2371],["mire",2400,2404],["muddy",2487,2492],["mistress",2704,2712],["mistress",2819,2827],["rude",2841,2845],["rude",3349,3353],["intrusion",3861,3870],["dim",3881,3884],["dragged",4282,4289],["fear",4423,4427],["suffered",4530,4538],["imprisonment",4546,4558],["shamefully",4762,4772]],"events":[],"dates":[["daily",393,398],["many years",532,542],["two centuries ago",1980,1997],["the\"",3503,3507],["the\"",3711,3715],["fifteen",4361,4368],["those days",4644,4654],["1688",5034,5038],["the\"",5185,5189],["1688",5383,5387]],"times":[["all night",4321,4330]],"distances":[["about a mile",480,492],["a quarter of a mile",1364,1383],["a quarter of a mile",4881,4900],["about nine feet",5108,5123]],"loc_advs":[["past",670,674],["there",1565,1570],["home",2150,2154],["past",2287,2291],["there",2967,2972],["left",2995,2999],["there",3848,3853],["there",4868,4873],["there",4918,4923],["within",5208,5214],["there",5222,5227],["there",5423,5428]],"spa_preps":[["about",39,44],["near",76,80],["among",194,199],["into",410,414],["about",646,651],["over",713,717],["down",766,770],["into",771,775],["through",790,797],["out",851,854],["under",888,893],["into",933,937],["into",1037,1041],["beyond",1063,1069],["opposite",1334,1342],["about",1358,1363],["close",1391,1396],["about",1715,1720],["around",1821,1827],["about",1903,1908],["over",2193,2197],["about",2356,2361],["among",2394,2399],["about",2530,2535],["about",2605,2610],["through",2909,2916],["out",3098,3101],["below",3282,3287],["into",4056,4060],["under",4346,4351],["about",4620,4625],["down",4636,4640],["over",5279,5283]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0079207921,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.998852253},{"para_id":148,"paragraph":"About a mile west of Fox's chapel, a byeway leads into the old Roman road, at a place where a tesselated pavement was found a few years ago.

The pretty village of Bardsea is full in sight, at the foot of the hill. On the southern slope of this rocky moorland there is a small Druidical Temple, - a circle of nine hoary stones, which, with one exception, are still more or less upright. A quarter of a mile west of this relic of British history, and near an antique farmhouse, called\" Sunbreak,\" there is a lonely burial-ground, looking out towards sea. This is the oldest graveyard of the Society of Friends. It is surrounded by a high stone wall, and carefully kept in order. The door is generally locked, but I found it simply fastened with a staple and chain, and a wooden peg. The interior contains no visible commemoration of the dead; but a thick swathe of the greenest grass covers the whole area, save on the higher side, where picturesque fragments of limestone rock, rising above the rich herbage, are so beautifully bemossed here and there, that it seems as if nature, in her quiet, lovely way, had taken in hand to keep the memories of these nameless tenants of the dust forever green. There was something more touchingly beautiful, more suggestive of repose, in the recordless silence of this lone graveyard of the persecuted puritan, than in any cemeteries adorned with grand efforts of monumental art - which so oft intrude upon the solemnity of death things sullied by the vanities of the living. The sacred simplicity of the spot made one feel more deeply how sound they slept below, in that unassailable shelter from the hurtful world. The very sea-breeze seemed to pause there, and pass over this place of unawaking dreamers in a kind of requiem-hush.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["chapel",27,33],["road",69,73],["summit",201,207],["bay",274,277],["shores",305,311],["village",324,331],["foot",368,372],["hill",380,384],["slope",402,407],["stones",491,497],["ground",692,698],["sea",720,723],["stone",808,813],["wall",814,818],["door",853,857],["rock",1143,1147],["sea",1835,1838],["pass",1873,1877]],"pos_words":[["leads",44,49],["pretty",317,323],["picturesque",1108,1119],["rich",1166,1170],["beautifully",1187,1198],["quiet",1259,1264],["lovely",1266,1272],["beautiful",1406,1415],["grand",1556,1561],["monumental",1573,1583],["unassailable",1781,1793],["breeze",1839,1845]],"neg_words":[["bleak",195,200],["rocky",416,421],["lonely",678,684],["dead",1007,1011],["dust",1350,1354],["lone",1478,1482],["intrude",1603,1610],["death",1633,1638],["hurtful",1811,1818]],"events":[],"dates":[["a few years ago",124,139]],"times":[],"distances":[["About a mile",0,12],["A mile",141,147],["quarter of a mile",560,577]],"loc_advs":[["there",431,436],["upright",549,556],["there",667,672],["here",1208,1212],["there",1217,1222],["there",1862,1867]],"spa_preps":[["into",50,54],["near",621,625],["out",708,711],["above",1156,1161],["below",1766,1771],["over",1878,1882]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0165745856,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9892242551},{"para_id":149,"paragraph":"Gleaston Castle is about six miles from Ulverstone. The direct road to it lies through the old village of Urswick. At the end of this village there is a fine tarn close by the highway. The people of Urswick Vale have a legend that the ruins of an ancient town lie beneath the waters of this town. Near Urswick, there is a small monastic ruin of Bolton Chapel, standing in a farm-yard, by the road, and now used as a cow-house. Leaving this village, we pass Redmond Hall, the seat of a family once known in English History. About a mile from Gleaston Castle, in a hollow of the fields, on the left hand side of the road, there is a pretty little sheet of water, called Mere Tarn, swarming with pike. The castle originally consisted of four square towers, connected by strong curtain walls, defending an enclosure, the length of which seemed to me about one hundred yards. One of these towers has disappeared, and the other three are more or less ruinous; but the summits of the two may yet be easily ascended by the stone steps which wind up the thickness of the massive walls. In its palmy days this castle must have looked imposing in the heart of the little vale, where it seems to have been placed more for shelter and seclusion than for anything commanding in position. It was built by the Flemings, lords of the ancient manor of Much Land. The possesions of Michael le Fleming were the only lands in all Furness exempted from the grant made by Stephen, Earl of Bologne and Moreton, to Furness Abbey. The name of this Michael, which the natives pronounce\" Mickle,\" still clings to old associations in this neighbourhood, as in the case of\" Michael's Well.\" I remember how, on that breezy day, when, with two friends, I visited the ruins of this castle, as we were casting about Gleaston in hungry search of a dinner, we found this old well in a mossy corner at the entrance of the village. The stones about it were worn by the footing of many generations, and the water was so clear that I could have seen a single thread of a lady's hair at the bottom of it. I remember too, that when we were beginning to despair of finding anything like substantial refreshment, we met with it at the very last house at the western edge of the village, a clean little hostelry, where we got an excellent dinner of eggs and bacon, cheese, ale, pickles, salad fresh from the garden behind the house, and three quarts of butter milk; in addition to which, I had my shoe mended; and we were treated with more than common civility, and for the low charge of three and sixpence, - which was received with satisfaction. The way of the shoe business was this, - I had burst the seam of it, and it was getting squashy with wet, for we had a delightfully rough tramp over moss and fell, and through miry bye-roads, that day. The good wife at the alehouse offered to get it mended for me whilst dinner was cook - ing. The old man lent me a shoe of his own to put on meanwhile. It was as hard as an iron pot; in fact, it had a considerable weight of iron work about it, and for any rough work, I thought that that one shoe was worth at least four pair such as mine. With one foot handicapped in this clog of iron and leather, I amused myself with walking about the clean floor, listening to the difference of sound in my footsteps, which went\" fuzz, clang - fuzz, clang,\" reminding me of the three bells of a little country church that I have heard of, one of which was sound, the next cracked, and the third mended with leather, - their united music amounting to a kind of\" ding, dang, puff.\" The shoe came back mended before dinner was over, and a thrill of returning comfort went through my frame when I got it on, for I had felt as if walking with a wet dish-cloth round my foot a while before. As we returned through the village, one of my friends proposed we should just look in upon a relation of his, an old shoemaker and a quaint man, well versed in the folk lore of the district. He then lead us up to one of the most comfortable-looking cottages ever saw. The floor was as clean as a plate just laid down for dinner, the place smelt as sweet as a herb stall, and all the polishable metal things shone like pools of water in moonlight. The cheerful old wife, whose ruddy face was bedded in a snowy old-fashioned cap, and whose eyes, in spite of age and spectacles, looked as bright as the stars on a frosty night, rose from her arm-chair, and hobbled about with her crutch, smiling and talking, and talk - ing and smiling, as if she did n't know exactly what to do to shew that she was very fain. At last, opening the door of the inner room, where the hearty old fellow and his son sat at work, she said\" What, dinnet ye see wha's here?\" Dropping his hammer, and brushing the dirt from his leather apron, the old man rose above six feet into the air, pushed up his spectacles, and shouted,\" Why, it never is, sewer! It cannot be reightly can it! It's nowt i' the warld else, aw declare! Well, this is a capper, hooivver! What, yeere right good stuff for sore even mon! Whatever quarter's the wind in, at yeere blawn this gate on? Well, cum, cum; sit ye daan and let's mak use o' ye while ye are here.\" \" Ye hevn't hed yeere teea, aw warnd,\" said the good wife. But we were already primely filled with good things, and no other feast could have been so delightful as the genial welcome which the old couple gave us. The day, too, was waning with an uncertain sky, and we had several miles to go. As we sat talking with the old man, a fine pair of new double-soled shooting boots stood at my elbow. I took them up, and asked what such a pair would cost.

This famous abbey was endowed with extraordinary wealth and power; and its prelates were temporal princes, ruling with almost absolute sway over a district as large as the Isle of Man; and yet, those white-robed monks from Savigny, and their successors, were the humanising mediators between feudal tyranny and serfdom, in the rough old days. I am told that the language of the common people of Furness still retains French words and idioms not found elsewhere in Lancashire, - lingering relics of the influence of the foreign ecclesiastics who ruled in this remote corner of England so long. It would be easy to give an architectural description of the ruins from careful works already written, but I refrain, partly from want of room, and partly because the visitor can buy all that information for a trifle on the spot itself. I may say, however, that in addition to the general effect, the high altar with its beautiful sedilia, the chapter-house, and the Abbot's private chapel, were particularly interesting to me.

A boat may be had at the pier, to the island, which is immediately opposite, divided from the main land by a narrow channel. Going by way of Barrow, the distance by rail is about twelve miles; but the route is more varied. No other way of approaching the ruins of this fortress is so impressive as by boat from Barrow, which is easily obtained, especially if\" civil old Joe Winder\" be about. This route also gives the tourist a good opportunity of seeing the harbour. The isle of Walney, Rampside, and the most characteristic objects of this remote nook of the Furness shore, are in sight from the water. Barrow itself is an interesting spot. It is now the great port of Furness, and a place of increasing importance. Here, most of the ore of the district is shipped for Carron and Swansea, where it is used to enrich the poorer ores of Scotland and Wales. Hollingshed says that the Scots, in the reign of Edward the Second, during one of their raids into England,\" met with no iron worth their notice until they came to Furness, in Lancashire, where they seized all the manufactured iron they could find, and carried it off with the greatest joy, though so heavy of carriage, and preferred it to all other plunder.\" In Barrow and its neighbourhood, as in many other parts of Furness, roads, houses, cattle, and men are more or less coloured with oxide of iron. A Furness miner, when disguised in his Sunday clothes, is seldom slow to tell you that he has\" taen his degrees i' the Red Lone College.\" The view of Peel Castle, as the boat nears the island from Barrow, is very striking. The castle was built by the Abbots of Furness, in the reign of Edward the Third, upon an older foundation, supposed to be the remains of a Danish fortress. These fierce sea-rovers often ravaged this part of the coast, and the terrors of their name linger yet among its traditions. The castle has been a place of much greater extent and strength than now appears. On the eastern side of the island, where high tides wash the base of the ruins, immense blocks of wall, which have been many years among the water, are yet as firmly held together by their old cement as if they were solid rock. On the east and southern sides, the sea now covers a great extent of the old foundations, which are visible, here and there, under water. On the north and western sides, the two great ditches, the double lines of wall, and the strong flanking towers, still give some idea of the strength of the ancient defences. Near the ruins, there are two cottages, where the only inhabitants of the island reside. The largest of these cottages is a public-house, chiefly frequented by sailors.

A coach starts thither from the latter place every day in summer. The road is full of interesting variety, winding by the banks of the River Leven almost all the way. On the right hand, the upper part of the estuary stretches out from near the highway, bounded by the fells and beautiful shores of Cartmel; on the left, the green hills of Low Furness throw their shadows, here and there, across the way. The River Leven brings down the waters of Windermere to the sea. About four miles on the road, the beautiful valley of the Crake opens up on the western side, and the summits of the Coniston into the Leven. If any sojourner at Ulverstone desires a fine walk through picturesque scenery, let him go about two miles along this high road from Ulverstone, then up Newland Vale about a mile, and then northwards across the hills a mile and a half, down to the village of Penny Bridge, at which spot he may be safely left to the influence of the scene. From these high grounds, between Newland Vale and Crake Vale, there are glorious views of the Coniston mountains. Near the entrance of the Crake Valley the road passes the picturesque little village and port of Greenodd, in a nook of the estuary. A short distance from Greenodd, over the hills, there is an interesting old Baptist chapel, built in the intolerant days of the\" Five Mile Act.\" At Backbarrow - where a stranger may be surprised to find a cotton-mill in such a spot - the River Leven falls over the rocks beautifully, on the right hand-side of the road. Thence, to Newby Bridge, the road lies through a delightful woodland scene between the hills, with the river shining and singing all the way over its old bed of mossy rocks, down on the left hand. The old mansion-like inn, called the White Swan, is delightful situated by the clear Leven side. In front of the house, a quaint bridge of five arches spans the stream, and a few yards below, the river runs over a little fall, filling the quiet vale with its drowsy song. Above the bridge, the water comes down from Windermere through lovely scenery, gradually narrowing from a lake to a river, with the current of water scarcely discernible. The picturesque old inn, the bridge, the river, the drowsy fall, the choral woods, and every object in the hollow of this green nest of the mountains, is full of beauty and repose; and the hills that shut them in from the rest of the world heighten the general charm. The clear river glides by the front of the inn, with only the road between. It is pleasant to sit at the upper windows, or on the green flower-garnished benches below, on a summer evening, listening to the birds and the waterfall, and watching the fish leaping up from the water, as if giving a last frolic defiance to the cook at the White Swan.

Shut out on the east by England's wildest mountains, and on the west by the Irish Channel, this region was, till lately, more difficult of approach than any other quarter of that picturesque land. Tourists have made fitful trips to its retired lakes and glens, but have seldom wandered far there, or remained long enough to drink in the spirit of its varied scenery. Taking the beaten track of imitative sight-seers, they have climbed out of Borrowdale into Buttermere; and after eating char at the\" Fish,\" and talking over the legend of the vale, they have gone in a boat across Crummock Water, to look at Scale Force - the lady of English waterfalls. They have followed mountain guides over craggy wildernesses down to the lone hamlet at Wastdale Head; from whence they have, perhaps, ascended Scawfell. The mountain tops have shewn green valleys winding to westward, lighted here and there by the glimmer of a clear river's\" sweet meander,\" with the blue sea heaving beyond; but, after a hasty glance at some of the great features mentioned in guide-books, they have generally turned again to more familiar haunts of tourist life, content to believe that what they were leaving unexplored must be uninteresting, because comparatively little known. But he who wanders lovingly in that cabinet land between the mountains and the main, will find it full of natural variety, from the wildest mountain sublimity to soft pastoral vales whose beauty melts into the sea. One charm peculiar to this remote part of the Lake District is, that the ocean lips its western border, stretching grandly to the horizon's edge save where the outlines of Mona's historic isle stand out from the waves. The voice of the sea floats up its green valleys, as if to woo their wandering waters home. Some of these rivers are of rare beauty, such as the Duddon - that darling stream of Wordsworth's lay - the Esk, the Irt, the Ehen, and the Calder, - whose tranquil murmurs mingled so long with the monastic chants of its secluded vale. I do not know a better clue to the finest features of the district than its water-courses afford. They abound in scenes delightful to the painter's eye. From the shore, where they glide into the sea, they lead through green holms and vales; under shady woods; by quaint hamlets and bowery nooks; between craggy banks, festooned with greenery; now stealing silently over level sands; but mostly, in glittering frolic, among picturesque beds of mossed rock: till they come to where lone lakes lie among savage mountains, down whose steeps tributary cascades leap from their wild birthplace.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Peel",104,108],["Furness",112,119],["Whitehaven",124,134],["Cumberland",138,148],["England",221,228],["Irish Channel",273,286],["Borrowdale",639,649],["Buttermere",655,665],["Crummock Water",777,791],["Scale Force",804,815],["Wastdale Head",937,950],["Scawfell",993,1001],["Lake District",1709,1722],["Duddon",2027,2033],["Wordsworth",2059,2069]],"geonouns":[["lake",19,23],["sea",81,84],["mountains",239,248],["region",293,299],["land",388,392],["lakes",441,446],["glens",451,456],["track",582,587],["vale",739,743],["boat",765,769],["waterfalls",838,848],["mountain",869,877],["hamlet",927,933],["mountain",1007,1015],["valleys",1038,1045],["winding",1046,1053],["river",1116,1121],["sea",1155,1158],["land",1492,1496],["mountains",1509,1518],["mountain",1588,1596],["vales",1624,1629],["sea",1658,1661],["horizon",1793,1800],["edge",1803,1807],["isle",1851,1855],["sea",1899,1902],["valleys",1923,1930],["waters",1961,1967],["rivers",1988,1994],["stream",2049,2055],["vale",2204,2208],["district",2268,2276],["water",2286,2291],["shore",2372,2377],["sea",2405,2408],["vales",2444,2449],["woods",2463,2468],["hamlets",2480,2487],["nooks",2499,2504],["banks",2521,2526],["sands",2586,2591],["beds",2645,2649],["rock",2660,2664],["lakes",2695,2700],["mountains",2718,2727]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",376,387],["enough",511,517],["tops",1016,1020],["glimmer",1097,1104],["clear",1110,1115],["sweet",1125,1130],["great",1216,1221],["variety",1562,1569],["soft",1610,1614],["beauty",1636,1642],["charm",1667,1672],["woo",1941,1944],["beauty",2007,2013],["darling",2041,2048],["tranquil",2130,2138],["better",2226,2232],["finest",2245,2251],["afford",2300,2306],["abound",2313,2319],["delightful",2330,2340],["lead",2415,2419],["quaint",2473,2479],["frolic",2619,2625],["picturesque",2633,2644]],"neg_words":[["ruins",95,100],["neglect",188,195],["difficult",323,332],["lone",922,926],["hasty",1188,1193],["peculiar",1673,1681],["shady",2457,2462],["stealing",2557,2565],["lone",2690,2694],["lie",2701,2704],["savage",2711,2717],["wild",2782,2786]],"events":[],"dates":[["any other quarter",350,367],["the\"",692,696]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",154,159],["there",487,492],["across",770,776],["westward",1057,1065],["here",1075,1079],["there",1084,1089],["between",1497,1504],["home",1968,1972]],"spa_preps":[["out",7,10],["out",202,205],["out",632,635],["into",650,654],["over",716,720],["over",885,889],["down",910,914],["beyond",1167,1173],["into",1649,1653],["out",1862,1865],["into",2396,2400],["through",2420,2427],["under",2451,2456],["between",2506,2513],["over",2575,2579],["among",2627,2632],["among",2705,2710],["down",2729,2733]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0452830189,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9965311885},{"para_id":169,"paragraph":"This district is no less remarkable for the associations of history than for its natural charms, its mineral wealth, and its interest to men of science.

There had been a great storm of wind and rain during the night, but now, everything from the sky to the ground looked fresh and glad; and the old market-place was all still as a cloister, except where a few pigeons pecked and croodled about the cobble pavement, or a red hued iron miner went whistling through the sunshine, on his way to work.

Half Past six. We are off towards Black Coomb. The handle of Buckland's geological hammer stuck out of his brown swinger, and he had a strong hempen wallet over his shoulder.

Before we could satisfy ourselves with this beautiful scene, the train turned back a little to get upon the Whitehaven line, and, in a quarter of an hour, we were rolling along the shore of Duddon estuary, where the cool sea-breeze came freshly over tumbling waves. Leaving Kirkby, with its great slate quarries on the moor side, we stop a Foxfield, and a few travellers get out to go forward on the Coniston line. Yonder is the bold peak of the Old Man. And here, a little to the right hand, is the town of Broughton, on a sunny slope. But our line clings to the sea.

These were let into the watery enclosure, one at a time, through a little square opening, where they were soused, and scrubbed, and swilled by the sturdy washers inside, and then let out, panting, frightened, and clean, through a similar opening on the opposite side.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Black Coomb",121,132]],"geonouns":[["hotel",47,52],["hollow",59,65],["railway",84,91],["line",92,96],["slope",112,117],["cottages",185,193],["village",307,314],["road",346,350],["fields",386,392],["path",407,411],["inn",433,436],["points",502,508],["mountain",643,651],["waters",687,693],["stone",719,724],["districts",754,763],["stone",875,880],["field",881,886],["wall",887,891]],"pos_words":[["greatest",4,12],["remarkable",152,162],["pleasant",214,222],["right",375,380],["interesting",561,572],["sturdy",1040,1046],["clean",1106,1111]],"neg_words":[["irregular",169,178],["struck",359,365],["slowly",477,483],["steep",676,681],["rude",714,718]],"events":[],"dates":[["Silecroft",21,30],["about a quarter of an hour",514,540]],"times":[["that morning",223,235]],"distances":[["about half a mile",321,338]],"loc_advs":[["here",269,273],["there",278,283],["opposite",1146,1154]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",34,42],["through",295,302],["beyond",351,357],["over",366,370],["down",634,638],["into",908,912],["through",950,957],["inside",1055,1061],["out",1076,1079],["through",1113,1120]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0188679245,"vader_sentiment":0.75,"roberta_sentiment":0.9896425605},{"para_id":177,"paragraph":"Heavy, and dripping, to the breezy brow Slow move the harmless race; where, as they spread","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["brow",35,39]],"pos_words":[["harmless",54,62]],"neg_words":[["dripping",11,19]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.25,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9922571182},{"para_id":178,"paragraph":"Their swelling treasures to the sunny ray, Inly disturbed, and wondering what this wild Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints The country fill: and tossed from rock to rock, Incessant bleatings run around the hills.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["country",139,146],["rock",169,173],["rock",177,181],["hills",218,223]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["swelling",6,14],["disturbed",48,57],["wild",83,87],["loud",119,123],["complaints",124,134]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["around",207,213]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.2083333333,"vader_sentiment":-0.4,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9975861311},{"para_id":179,"paragraph":"As this went on, the water was continually refreshed by the in-flowing stream; and a little outlet at the lower end carried away its impurities. Shouts and laughter of herdsmen, and the barking of dogs, came cheerily up the hill side; and the air was vocal with tremulous complainings of sheep and lambs, which, having passed through the\" wash,\" wandered wildly about the heathy steep, chased to and fro by dogs. The clear stream leaping by our pathway; the majestic mountain high above us; the beautiful bowery vale below; the blue sea hard by; the splendour of the morning; the stillness all around, save where this pastoral tumult rose; it was a scene that kept us gazing with delight. But we had Black Coomb to climb, so we toiled slowly up the rough way, oft pausing to look back at the landscape. This is the steepest part of the ascent from Silecroft; but our tricksy streamlet kept us pleasant company till about a thousand feet above the sea. Here we came upon a bleak platform, where silent desolation reigned. A better road now took a circuit over the expanse, afterwards making a white and winding line up to the summit. From this point each chose a path which he thought would lead soonest to the top; and, half an hour's climbing found us together at a pile of stones left by the government surveyors. All around us was a sombre wilderness strewn with slabs and splinters of Skiddaw slate. No bird, nor bee, nor buzz of summer life was there. When the cold strong wind lay still for a minute, the only sound heard was a low murmur of the sea breaking against the coast below. There was nothing astir, but here and there a black-faced moorland tup, staring fiercely, as if half - inclined to dispute our strange intrusion. Sometimes a cloud sailed overhead, putting us into gloomy shadow, and making the wilderness look wilder. It was a strange sight, then, to watch the play of sun and shade upon the lower slopes, and to see the strong sunlight sleeping serenely on the green vale below.

With some difficulty we made way into the swampy hollow of this immense basin. High up in an inaccessible part of the rocks, ravens were screaming, and wheeling about their wild eyrie. That lofty sweep of blackened crags seemed to frown the landscape into silence, as I stood, lost in the gloomy profound, listening to the geological conversation of my two friends. A curious, cone-shaped mound rises in the centre of the hollow. The lower side, or lip of the basin, is broken off; and an extensive porphyry dike runs down into the southward vale. In the same direction, the narrow gorge, through which we descended the valley, is watered by a wild stream, called\" Witcham Mill,\" which fills the pass with turbulent glee, as it dashes over the rocks. By the side of the stream, a good road brought us down to\" Witcham Mill,\" a building quaintly worn with age, and sheltered deep in a nook by the water side, below\" White Hall Knot.\" Somehow, a corn mill seems to belong, naturally, to quietness and green country; and the sounds that arise therefrom mingle better with the sounds of wild birds and leafy rustlings of the woods than with the tumults of town life. Sedgwick knew the miller well, so we walked about the building, in and out, with the cheerful old corn-crusher, whilst Buckland splashed through\" Witcham Beck,\" and clambered about the ferny crags, in search of some rare plant that he knew of. It was now long past noon. Threatening clouds hung over us, and rain began to fall. There was a little public-house a mile over the eastward fields, and we made haste to its friendly shade. The house is kept by a staid old widow, who supplied us with bread and cheese, milk and butter - all her humble larder could afford - but it was very good. The distance from this place to the druidical temple, at Swinside, as about four miles. The shower soon ended, and all was bright again. We took a path which winds about the south side of\" White Hall Knot,\" and then through the hollow of a deep glen to the east, where a handsome lad was whipping small trout from the stream almost as fast as he could put bait on hook. Leaving this road, Sedgwick led up the hills, where there was no trodden footing; - now through green swamps, that often turned us back; now through rough tracks of heather; now over stone walls, that rattled after us as we leaped down; now splashing through a watercourse; now labouring up a craggy steep; till at last, men and horses at work, and the gables of a farm-house came in sight on the distant hill-side. The temple is near this lonely farm-house. We had to climb a lofty wall into the great enclosure where it stands. The day was glorious; and we sat down upon dry moss within the circle, resting our backs against one of its gray stones. The temple is 285 feet in circumference; and consists of fifty - four moss-grown stones, some of which are prostrate, a few still nearly upright, and all slanting more or less in different directions. Through a cleft in one of the largest blocks, a fine young rowan-tree or mountain ash, has pushed its way from the ground, spreading its branches over the venerable stone. This sylvan hermit prefers the unsheltered hills to crowded woods and forests. It was interesting to find this tree, which has been associated with the wildest superstitions of our island from time immemorial, hanging here so fresh and green, over the relics of the ancient temple. From the\" Forest Trees of Britain\" I cull these words about it: -\" Lightfoot and Gilpin are both of opinion that the mountain ash was held in high estimation by the Druids. The former says,' It may be observed to grow more frequently than any other tree in the neighbourhood of those druidical circles of stones so often seen in the north of Britain; and the superstitious still continue to retain a great veneration for it, which was undoubtedly handed down to them from early antiquity.'

At two we left for Holborn Hill, on the Whitehaven line. When we came to Duddon Sands the air was unusually clean, and the heather flower in full glow along the line. From the station, Millom Castle is visible among a clump of trees about a mile eastward. The high road goes by it. The village of Holborn Hill was a little on the left, and, from what I could see, it is simply one street or rural cottages, mostly whitewashed. There is something instructive about the old names of places in England, but the new title given to this village is far away from the character of the place and the scenery around. As we drew near the gray walls of Millom, all was sunny and still, and a few tall trees threw their shadows across the road. There was a little round-faced lad loitering by the hedge with a switch in his hand. We asked him what house that was. \" It's the castle,\" said he. \" What castle?\" \" Aa dinner knaa.\" \" Who lives at it?\" \" Yon man, yonder,\" replied he, pointing to a stout farmer who was watching his men in a neighbouring field. The happy lad then played with his switch again, and loitered by the ancient castle as if it was a ruined cow-shed. So much for the changes time brings round. This lad might be descended from a serf of these old feudal lords of Millom who ruled over a country eighteen miles long, and, in some places, eight miles broad. They were endowed with extraordinary privileges, for theirs was a jurisdiction into which the sheriff of the county could not enter.

The castle was embattled in 1335, by Sir John Huddleton. In ancient times it was surrounded by a fine park, of which there are some scanty remains on a ridge to the north. The greatest square tower is still habitable, though its old battlements are gone. The castle was invested during the parliamentary war, and the old vicarage house was pulled down at the same time,\" lest the rebels should take refuge there.\" There are traces of the ancient moat still visible. We turned in between the broken pillars of an old gateway, and up a deserted avenue, to the front of the ruin, which, though not of great extent, presents a fine specimen of the decayed pomp of feudal times. The walls of the court-yard were all weather-stained and worn; and, here and there, delicate beds of moss have crept over them, year after year, so long, that the moist old stones are now mantled with hues of great beauty. The front of the castle is roofless, and some parts of its massive walls are thickly clothed with ivy, in which the wild birds were flitting out and in to their nests. Even in ruin this part of the castle has a noble appearance. A fine flight of worn steps leads up through the frowning archway, to the great tower, in the inner court. Above this archway a stone shield bears the decayed heraldries of the Huddleston family; and these arms appear, also, on the slab in the garden wall, and in other parts of the buildings. Whilst we roamed about the inner court, the front entrance of the great tower stood open, and we caught sight of a fine old carved staircase, which led me to suppose that the interior may retain many of its ancient characteristics. That part of the moat which remains below the walls of the western tower is mostly filled with weeds and brushwood; and it divides the castle from the ancient parish church, which stands upon a knoll, overlooking the fields. The church is a venerable building, with its quaint little turret, contain - ing two bells. Near the easy window is an octagon stone font, ornamented with quatrefoils, and a shield charged with the arms of Huddleston. \" The church contains an ancient mural tablet to the memory of the Huddleston family, and near it is an altar-tomb ornamented with Gothic tracery, on which recline the effigies of a knight and his lady, but in a very mutilated state.\" Peeping through a corner window we say this altar-tomb, with its recumbent figures, close to the wall. In the churchyard, the sculptured shaft of an ancient cross, charged with four shields, still stands erect. A plaintive tone of decay was over all the works of man about us, in spite of the smiling fields; and the rooks, cawing above the tree-tops which shade the ruin, were quite in keeping with the spirit of the scene. In the burial-ground all was hoary and old. The worn steps leading to the field; the dim sun-dial; the mossy walls; the fragments of ancient sculpture reared against the church; the head stones, leaning decrepidly in irregular ways; the weed-grown grave-stones, mottled with decayed verdure, and trodden by long footing, till almost illegible. Fit companion, this eloquent old bed-chamber of the dead, for the mouldering fortress whose pride it had seen, and whose decline it was sharing. There was nobody about; but a faint buzz came from the new school-house, a little northward. We knocked at the inner door, and a stout young man with a mild face came out to us. He was too shy to talk much, but he told us that there was a fine view from the top of a knoll, three fields off, westward. A footpath from the church stile led to it, and, when we came there, it was as he had said. The rippling estuary, filled with the top of the tide, and all glorious with sunshine, was in sight, spreading out to the open sea. Close to, on the north-west, Black Coomb looked solemnly down upon us. Going eastward, the eye wandered over the Coniston range; till, on the morning of the horizon, the sky was wild with mountains behind mountains reared, among whose summits the sun was trailing his golden hues in graceful change, as if trying to weave a garment fit for such a royal scene. At the foot of the knoll there was a charming contrast in the silent fields, the church, and the ruined castle half - concealed by trees.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Black Coomb",3855,3866],["Coniston",3939,3947]],"geonouns":[["land",50,54],["castle",60,66],["park",158,162],["ridge",208,213],["tower",248,253],["castle",315,321],["house",386,391],["walls",734,739],["beds",823,827],["stones",903,909],["castle",970,976],["walls",1020,1025],["castle",1151,1157],["tower",1262,1267],["stone",1310,1315],["wall",1433,1437],["buildings",1465,1474],["entrance",1526,1534],["tower",1548,1553],["walls",1754,1759],["tower",1775,1780],["castle",1843,1849],["parish",1867,1873],["church",1874,1880],["fields",1925,1931],["church",1937,1943],["building",1959,1967],["stone",2060,2065],["church",2157,2163],["wall",2483,2487],["fields",2687,2693],["tree",2727,2731],["ground",2825,2831],["field",2885,2890],["walls",2920,2925],["church",2981,2987],["head",2993,2997],["stones",2998,3004],["stones",3065,3071],["bed",3188,3191],["school",3359,3365],["house",3366,3371],["door",3417,3421],["top",3558,3561],["fields",3580,3586],["church",3622,3628],["estuary",3707,3714],["top",3732,3735],["sea",3821,3824],["horizon",3983,3990],["mountains",4014,4023],["mountains",4031,4040],["summits",4061,4068],["foot",4193,4197],["fields",4255,4261],["church",4267,4273],["castle",4290,4296],["trees",4317,4322]],"pos_words":[["greatest",232,240],["great",654,659],["delicate",814,822],["great",939,944],["beauty",945,951],["noble",1164,1169],["fine",1184,1188],["leads",1210,1215],["great",1256,1261],["great",1542,1547],["led",1624,1627],["quaint",1978,1984],["easy",2034,2038],["works",2640,2645],["smiling",2679,2686],["tops",2732,2736],["leading",2870,2877],["eloquent",3175,3183],["pride",3247,3252],["led",3635,3638],["glorious",3757,3765],["golden",4094,4100],["graceful",4109,4117],["charming",4223,4231],["silent",4248,4254]],"neg_words":[["embattled",71,80],["broken",547,553],["ruin",627,631],["decayed",700,707],["worn",787,791],["crept",841,846],["wild",1069,1073],["ruin",1129,1133],["worn",1199,1203],["decayed",1333,1340],["decay",2617,2622],["spite",2666,2671],["ruin",2753,2757],["worn",2859,2863],["dim",2896,2899],["irregular",3028,3037],["weed",3048,3052],["decayed",3086,3093],["dead",3207,3211],["decline",3276,3283],["faint",3330,3335],["wild",4004,4008],["ruined",4283,4289]],"events":[],"dates":[["1335",84,88],["a fine",151,157],["a fine",677,683],["year",858,862],["year",869,873],["a fine",1589,1595],["a fine",3537,3543]],"times":[["the morning",3964,3975]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",173,178],["there",462,467],["here",798,802],["there",807,812],["northward",3382,3391],["there",3527,3532],["westward",3592,3600],["there",3664,3669],["behind",4024,4030],["there",4211,4216]],"spa_preps":[["down",403,407],["in between",532,542],["over",847,851],["out",1094,1097],["through",1219,1226],["about",1493,1498],["below",1744,1749],["near",2241,2245],["through",2394,2401],["close",2470,2475],["over",2627,2631],["about",2653,2658],["above",2717,2722],["against",2969,2976],["about",3317,3322],["out",3467,3470],["out",3805,3808],["down",3883,3887],["over",3930,3934],["among",4049,4054]],"normalised_sentiment":0.005,"vader_sentiment":0.07,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9137813449},{"para_id":198,"paragraph":"We returned by the avenue again, taking the road thence to Broughton In-Furness. The way was full of variety; now down between the trees, and by an old farmstead; now meandering high about the unshaded upland, overlooking Duddon, and in sight of hills. About three miles on the road we came into a shady dell - a sylvan cup - where the wheel of Thwaites's mill is turned by a mountain stream, and the trees make\" a kind of checkered night and day.\" There seemed to be just room for the mill, the house, the bridge, the road, the trees, and the restless little river, whose lulling murmur awakened\" dreams that wave before the half - shut eye.\" We asked for a drink of milk at the miller's door, and were invited into a room, where the goodwife and her daughter were lining bed quilts with wadding, upon a wooden frame. We rested, and talked with them awhile; and when we rose to go, the old lady seemed half - offended that we should ask what there was to pay. At Buckman's Hall, which, I suppose, takes its name from the old house close by, we gained the highest point of the road, and a sharp turn brought in sight a splendid prospect of the upper part of the estuary and the country around it. The mountains seen from this height are nearly the same as seen from the knoll near Milom Church, but here they look grander, and present a different aspect, through change of position. This fine view is before us most of the way down Buckman's Brow, a long steep, ending in a shady avenue of trees as we draw near Duddon Bridge. The day had travelled by while we had lingered, and twilight was now closing over the scene. Before we were across Duddon it began to rain. We hurried over the green level, and up the hill, from the top of which the rain-loaded blast pelted us gallantly into the old King's Arms, at Broughton, a very comfortable shelter, especially at such a time. Tea, with good trimmings, was set out for us in a cosy parlour, where several trunks were piled in a nook. Here we talked of what we had seen during the day, and of the next day's ramble up Duddon Vale. It wanted an hour and a half to the time for the last train to Ulverstone; so we agreed to run down there for the night, and return to Broughton early in the morning. The remainder of our time was passed in the kitchen, with the landlord and a thin-faced young man, whom we had taken at first for a boozy cobbler; but he soon con - vinced us we were wrong. His manner was shy and hesitating; but on the commonest theme his language was choice and appropriate. He evinced an ardent love of nature and a well-stored mind. When we inquired about Duddon Vale, his eyes lighted up as he spoke of his rambles there, and of Wordsworth's sonnets in its praise. We spent an interesting hour with him till train time; and after ordering breakfast for eight o'clock next morning, we rolled down to Ulverstone through the rainy night. As we parted in the market place, my friend said,\" Half Past six in the morning, at the station. Good night!\"\" Good night! - but stop; how if one should sleep too long?\" \" Well then, the titter co' the latter up.

Let us open the window and see what we can see. Our parlour looks upon a kind of square opposite the hotel. About six yards from the corner there is a little grocery shop, up two worn steps, where women and children are going in and out with loaves, and ounces of tea, and butter wrapped in copybook leaves. Across the square a brown-faced man, in corduroy, is leaning against a doorway, smoking, and quietly stroking his chin, as if he thought it was about time to get shaved, if he only had the penny. Blue smoke is curling up lazily in the clear air from cottage chimneys; now it flies away on a gust of wind from the sea; and now it curls up lazily again. Doves are cooing and strutting yonder; sparrows are chirping noisily about the roofs; and hens are pecking on the road below. But the town is getting busy, for two men saunter into the square, talking together. One is filling a short pipe, and the other carries a long rough stick, such as cow-jobbers delight in. The man with the short pipe strikes a match on the bowl, turns his back to the wind, gets a light, pushes in the tobacco with his finger, puffs carefully half - a-dozen times, and then calls out\" Good morning\" to somebody at a window over our heads. Now a young greyhound bounds like a four - legged arrow into the sunny space, and begins to gambol about alone, as if playing with an invisible friend. Here comes another dog, a little frisky fellow, of no particular breed. This one barks a great deal, in a good-tempered way, and the two begin to sniff and frolic to and fro, as dogs do when they are\" thick together.\" What is he that comes next upon this little sunlit stage of country life? A very short, double-jointed fellow, with an enormous head and a most antique visage, that reminds me of something I have seen at the end of a spout on an old church wall. His age seems to have parted company with his growth about half way up the usual height, in an untimely way. He is talking to himself, and smiling about something, reckless of all observers, as he paddles across the square with a great pitcher in his hands. Which is the pitcher and which is the man? for though evidently a man in age, he does n't look as if he would hold more than two gallons or so, if he was fairly cleared out to make room for it. What if he should stumble now, and fall into the pitcher? Hold! he has turned the corner. May peace lead him kindly by the hand through this uncertain world. The clock in the little shop is striking eight, and a chubby lad trails by. His hands are deep in his pockets, and his nose looks cold, and moist. A slate hangs on his arm by a string, as he goes, with wandering steps and slow, sulkily kicking bits of stone on the road, and\" creeping like snail unwillingly to school.\" Suddenly a woman's voice calls out,\" Come now, gang thi ways, or I'll warm thee, my gentleman!\" The lad starts, takes his hands out of his pockets, and makes haste off at the house-end; after which, - he mutters and loiters again. Yonder, right before us, at the head of the steep main street, a private carriage road leads up the wooded hill to the tower of the Broughtons, of Broughton. But that must wait; for\" neat-handed Phillis\" is laying the cloth, and our friend of last night trickles in, with a mild salute, to join us at the morning meal. Over breakfast we talked about the route for the day: and our friend gave us some valuable hints anent it. The way we chose was up Duddon Vale, by Seathwaite, to Cockley Beck. Then, over Wrynose into Little Langdale; returning by Yewdale to Coniston, and so home by rail. After breakfast we walked up to Broughton Tower, which crowns a woody eminence, at the head of the town. It commands a fine view over the town and estuary out to sea; and eastward, of Furness Fells. The exterior has been somewhat modernised; and the old battlements have been replaced by a plain parapet. This tower is associated with a remarkable adventure in our history, which led to the downfall of its ancient owners. Mr. West says of the Broughtons, in his\" Antiquities of Furness,\"\" This was an Anglo Saxon family of high antiquity, in whose possession the manor of Broughton had remained from time immemorial, and whose chief seat was at Broughton till the reign of Henry Vii. At this period the power and interest of Sir Thomas Broughton was so considerable, that the Duchess of Burgundy relied on him as one of the principal confederates in the attempt to subvert the government of Henry Vii. by pretensions of Lambert Simnel.\" What the fate of that adventure was is well known. \" Sir Thomas is said to have fallen in the field of battle; but there remains a tradition that he returned, and lived many years amongst his tenants at Witherslack, in Westmorland, and was interred in the chapel there.\" With this unfortunate gentleman the family was extinguished in Furness; and the manor was granted to the Earl of Derby. For nearly two centuries it has been the property of the Sawrey family. Broughton may be called the capital of upper Furness.

By ten o'clock that bright forenoon we had crossed the hill north of Broughton town, and were walking over a green holm through which the pretty\" Little\" runs babbling and dancing, like a child dressed for a holiday, to go with Duddon to the sea. Leaving the Bootle road near Duddon Bridge, we turned off at the end of a black-smith's shop, taking the right hand road, which leads between tall hedge-rows up into the vale. This road soon quits the green level, and begins to soar windingly between the trees, by little plots of sloping garden, and cottages perched like bird-nests in leafy nooks, high above the narrow entrance of the vale. The river is deep below, hidden by the woods rising from its margin. The tree-shaded banks by our way-side were often thick with ferns and lichens, and tangled bushes of the dear old bramble,\" whose fruit full well the schoolboy knows.\" Its prickly stalks were loaded with luscious berries, and we stopped to pick a handful now and then. On the opposite side, the spreading shades of Duddon Grove mantled the lower slope of the mountain with rich autumnal foliage. There, below, green lawns trim paths, and cultivated grounds marked the influence of wealth and taste; above, Stoneside Fell rose proud and poor, and sternly free. Now we lost sight of the landscape, as we came into a cool, shady dingle, where the checkered pattern of overhanging leaves played quietly upon the sunny road; and the unseen river wooed us thenceforth with its quiet song. The hills begin to rise wilder before us - Corney Fell. Stainton Fell, Hest Fell, and Birker Fell. About a mile and a half from the entrance of the vale, we emerge upon a common. Here, the mansion of Duddon Grove, its rich grounds and plumy woods are left behind; and cultivated beauty gives place to the wild charms of untrimmed nature. \" The wilderness is rich with liberty.\" Yon patch of sunshine, gliding across the dark breast of Stainton Fell, seems to slacken in its journey, as if it had met with a spot that pleased it there. A smell of wood fires is about us; and mottle-faced lambs skip away from the ferny slope, bleating tremulously, and turning round to look back now and then. Here the solitary vale is almost treeless; and the road freaks in and out, so near the stream, that we are continually halting in wonder and admiration as some reach, more beautiful than the last, steals into sight. These mountain rivers obey the moods of the weather with great alacrity; hence the local proverb,\" Up with a shower, and down in an hour.\" But Duddon was in its glory on that sunny day, after the recent rains. Grand as those wild fells are, all purpled with autumnal splendour, the speciality, the very genius of that valley's charm, is the varied loveliness of its stream. I have roamed by many a pleasant moorland river, but I never saw one so full of delightful change as the Duddon. Every turn of it brings a new picture to the eye. Now, wildly-glad, it leaps down from the rocky hills; now, almost silent, it glides by in\" liquid lapse serene;\" now it meanders, pranked into a thousand silvery shapes of beauty, where moss-clad stones lie strewn about its bed in nature's careless state, and where its water seems to complain;\" with gentle murmur, that its course they do restrain.\" For three or four miles the road lies more or less near the stream, and we trailed by through its enchanting sights and sounds.

After this the road crosses the stream from Seathwaite Tarn, at Nettleslack Bridge. Near this bridge the two roads meet, and a guide-post points one way to Coniston, and the other to Langdale. The Langdale road, on the left, is ours. This upper part of the vale is wildly grand. The Langdale road goes up through a narrow defile, between Harter Fell and Grey Friars, where the stream is heard rushing deep below, overfrowned by precipitous crags. Emerging from this pass, it is worth while to linger a few minutes at Birk Brig. There, the stream comes down in a narrow channel, where the rocks are worn into quaint arches, and fantastic shapes, that might be the ruins of some water-spirit's palace. The river settles here in pools of clear green-tinged water, beautiful as liquid emerald. Some of these pools, or\" pots,\" are ten feet deep. Above this bridge the stream narrows rapidly, and the valley becomes a scene of almost unrelieved desolation, with Grey Friars on the right, Harter Fell and Hardknot on the left, and rocky Wrynose shutting in the scene ahead. Here,\" cloud-born\" Duddon steals down the wild vale as if afraid to disturb its loneness. Wordsworth says of the young stream, that the whistling blast chants its birth, and desolation is its patron saint. We began to think that Cockley Beck ought to be near, and yet there was no visible habitation in the silent glen. At last we spied a shepherd stalking along the hill with a lame sheep on his shoulders; and a clump of stunted trees came in sight, by the streamlet side. Our path led up to the trees, and we found a rude farmstead partly sheltered by them. It certainly did n't look promising at first. Could this be Cockley Beck that we had heard so much oft? We knocked, and inquired. The good-wife came to the door, and said, with a smile,\" This is t' plee\u00e0ce. There's neea udder hoose i' t da\u00e0l. Will ye cum in?\" We sat down in a low-roofed room, at the front. The smoky rafters were hung with hams, and shrunken legs of cured mutton; and, on a long shelf near the ceiling there were little cheeses, dried herbs, staves, jars, and a tattered book or two. By the ingle, a tall, grey-haired man, in clogs, corduroy breeches, and a rough light-blue woollen jacket, of home-made cloth, was quietly watching the wood fire, and keeping it up by laying sticks on from a pile before him. He was eighty - three years of age, and very deaf. Stealing a look at us occasionally, he turned away again, and went on feeding the fire, with a countenance as calm as if he was a statue of contented age. Evening was drawing on, and they told us we could stay all night, so we doffed our satchels, and began to be at home. The good-wife bustled about in her blue bedgown; and a low babble of children came from a room behind, which was half - filled with eilding for the winter. Looking out at the window, on the other side of the narrow vale, Hardknot rose bleak and craggy to the skies. Between its summit and that of Harter Fell, a lofty pass leads into Eskdale. About half - way down the Eskdale side are the ruins of a Roman camp, called Hardknot Castle,\" whose guardians bent the knee to Jove and Mars.\" In the opening between Hardknot and Wrynose, Scawfell was pointed out,\" with a lile mist a-top on it.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Cockley Beck",33,45],["Duddon",80,86],["Seathwaite Tarn",195,210],["Coniston",307,315],["Langdale",334,342],["Langdale",348,356],["Langdale",434,442],["Harter Fell",489,500],["Harter Fell",1133,1144],["Hardknot",1149,1157],["Wrynose",1181,1188],["Duddon",1237,1243],["Wordsworth",1308,1318],["Cockley Beck",1447,1459],["Cockley Beck",1839,1851],["Hardknot",3051,3059],["Harter Fell",3127,3138],["Eskdale",3164,3171],["Eskdale",3199,3206],["Hardknot Castle",3250,3265],["Hardknot",3340,3348],["Wrynose",3353,3360],["Scawfell",3362,3370]],"geonouns":[["chapel",72,78],["rocks",102,107],["falls",144,149],["road",166,170],["stream",183,189],["bridge",245,251],["roads",260,265],["post",284,288],["points",289,295],["road",357,361],["vale",408,412],["road",443,447],["stream",528,534],["crags",591,596],["pass",617,621],["stream",690,696],["channel",720,727],["rocks",739,744],["water",828,833],["river",855,860],["water",905,910],["bridge",1003,1009],["stream",1014,1020],["valley",1046,1052],["vale",1265,1269],["stream",1337,1343],["glen",1532,1536],["hill",1585,1589],["trees",1649,1654],["path",1697,1701],["trees",1716,1721],["door",1935,1939],["wood",2433,2437],["vale",3045,3049],["summit",3108,3114],["pass",3148,3152],["top",3408,3411]],"pos_words":[["beautiful",127,136],["grand",423,428],["worth",629,634],["quaint",759,765],["fantastic",778,787],["clear",886,891],["beautiful",912,921],["right",1126,1131],["saint",1417,1422],["silent",1525,1531],["led",1702,1705],["promising",1805,1814],["good",1913,1917],["smile",1958,1963],["calm",2667,2671],["good",2834,2838],["leads",3153,3158]],"neg_words":[["wildly",416,422],["defile",473,479],["precipitous",579,590],["worn",749,753],["ruins",814,819],["desolation",1090,1100],["rocky",1175,1180],["cloud",1225,1230],["steals",1244,1250],["wild",1260,1264],["afraid",1276,1282],["disturb",1286,1293],["desolation",1392,1402],["lame",1597,1601],["stunted",1641,1648],["rude",1738,1742],["hung",2110,2114],["tattered",2259,2267],["clogs",2323,2328],["rough",2355,2360],["deaf",2551,2555],["babble",2889,2895],["bleak",3065,3070],["ruins",3220,3225],["bent",3284,3288],["mist",3401,3405]],"events":[],"dates":[["eighty - three years of age",2513,2540],["the winter",2974,2984]],"times":[["a few minutes",651,664],["Evening",2712,2719],["all night",2767,2776]],"distances":[["about five miles",11,27],["ten feet",977,985]],"loc_advs":[["left",370,374],["here",869,873],["left",1165,1169],["ahead",1211,1216],["near",1472,1476],["there",1486,1491],["there",2199,2204],["home",2391,2395],["away",2603,2607],["home",2824,2828],["between",3332,3339]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",61,67],["over",93,97],["through",456,463],["between",481,488],["below",557,562],["down",703,707],["into",754,758],["down",1251,1255],["along",1575,1580],["down",2046,2050],["near",2182,2186],["about",2852,2857],["behind",2925,2931],["out",2994,2997],["into",3159,3163],["down",3190,3194],["out",3383,3386]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0268656716,"vader_sentiment":-0.81,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985662103},{"para_id":217,"paragraph":"There was about an hour and a half of daylight left; and, as it was\" nobbut a mile an' a hauf, mebby,\" to Hardknot Castle, we agreed to go there whilst tea was preparing.

A white cloth was on the table, and a bright wood fire filled the room with ruddy light. The goodwife spread our board with ham and eggs, and steaks of cured mutton; brown bread, white bread, and spice cakes; cheese, preserves strong tea, and cream - such as cities seldom get to see. John Tyson had come in from the fells, and he sat on a long wood bench under the window, very quiet. A great sheep-dog lay asleep on the hearth. It had a stony look about the eyes, and I thought it old, and perhaps blind. Cockley Beck was rushing by the front of the house, and the wind and rain filled the lone glen with a wild roaring. Sitting comfortably by the solitary farmer's fire, there was a strange charm in listening to the elementary war that raged in darkness around us. By way of getting into talk, I asked Tyson how old the dog was. He said it was only three years old. Dogs did n't last so long among those fells. They had a hard life of it. We noticed the wood fire; and he told us that brush-wood and turf was all they had to burn. Coals were too far off, and would cost too much for carriage. \" What,\" said he,\" weere verra neer oot o' t' warld, ye see; for Cocklo' Beck's seb'm mile fra a mill, five mile fra a shop, an' aboon fower mile fra a church - an' hard roads tull it, as ye'll hev sin.\" He said they made their own candles of the pith or rushes dipped in mutton fat. They made as many in two days as lasted the whole year. These rush dips are not much thicker than a strong knitting needle, and give but a dreary light to people accustomed to gas. But they seemed to think the light very good; beside, they went to bed soon o' nights. An iron clip, something like a pair of curling tongs, hung from the ceiling by a string; and in this clip the rushlight was stuck aslant, and shifted as it burnt away. Leather for the family's shoes was bought whilst at market, in Broughton of Whitehaven; and the shoes were made in their own house, by a wondering son of Crispin, who went from farm to farm among the fells, getting his meat and lodging, and, as I understood, about two shillings a pair, for his work. It was the same with clothing. A tailor came up the glen at certain times, and folding his legs upon the long table under the window for a few days, he ate and drank with the rest, and chatted and stitched away, till they were clothed for the year. Being among such a way of life as this felt like living three hundred years ago; and, somehow, the place reminded me of the highland bothy at Aberfoyle, where Bailie Nicol Jarvie signed the chieftain's tartan with a red hot poker. Tyson's wife told us that tourists rarely went by the house without calling. \" An' sometimes,\" she said,\" thooar tramps ca's, i' threes an' fowers; an' sometimes mair nor that.

The wind blows a gale from the south-west; and, far out yonder, the excited main lashes the north-west point, then breaks into mighty showers of spray, that leap high into the air, and make the sunlight wink with wild pearls.

But in yonder field, there are four of a wiser sort standing abreast behind a hedge, with a cold-and-hungry look, like men out of work. They have endured so much that they are not to be moved by any small terror now, - the railway train may thunder on, and do its worst. They stand with their backs to the cold wind, and they are all looking steadfastly at the ground, in one direction, as if they had just given in four charity tickets, and were confidently expecting a feed of corn and a horse-cloth a piece coming up at that spot in a few minutes. There is something comically pathetic about the countenances of those four, - for though they are four horses, their countenances are one; and if it were not that their manes and tails toss so in the breeze, they are as motionless as so many statues of patient distress.

These little roamers of the wild sea-shore make way with wonderful ease through the strong gale; and seem to quiver with delight to see Neptune's white horses leaping below. It was very exhilarating, that ride by the sea, with the salt breeze sweeping freshly through the carriage! A keen, quick-eyed Irish gentleman sat with us; and, looking out at the window with kindling glance, as if he gloried in this beautiful stir of nature, he rubbed his hands, and said,\" I'm thinking the' Gondola' will get a cheap lesson in dancing on Coniston Lake this day.\" Leaving Duddon estuary, we also lose sight of the sea for several miles; but there is only a narrow belt of undulant land between, and though out of sight, I may venture to say that we are hardly out of the sound of it. Near the quaint port of Ravenglass we are close to the sea again. This little old marine nook is about a mile from the ancient hall of Muncaster, and stands at the confluence of the rivers Esk, Irt, and Mite, which form a sandy harbour there. The first time I saw the place at sunset it reminded me of Kingsley's beautiful lyric,\" The Three Fishers.\" It looks as if it belonged quite as much to the sea as to the land; and in high tides, with a strong south-west wind, the waves wash up to its little streets, as if asserting that they have as much right to be there as anybody else. Ravenglass is nearly opposite the Isle of Man, and looks vastly like a place that has seen smuggling in its day. A market was granted to this ancient town in the reign of King John,\" by right of the haven there.\" For some centuries after, on the morning before St. James's Day, the officer of the Lords of Egremont proclaimed the fair in Ravenglass, attended by the sergeant of the bow of Egremont, with the insignia belonging thereto: when all the tenants of the Forest of Copeland came, as a customary service, to attend him in the proclamation of the fair, and to\" abide with him during the continuance thereof.\" About four miles beyond Ravenglass, the train stops at Seascale, a serene spot, with an inviting beach for sea-bathing; as they seem to have found out at the hotel close by, for there is a van upon the sands yonder. Some quiet people, who crept down here out of the way of fashionable perturbation, are so in love with the place, that they are afraid of it being found by the rest of the world. From Seascale onward, for more than ten miles, we run so near the sea that it looks as if we were sailing on one side and going by rail on the other; and to me, this amphibious part of the journey was very delightful.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Coniston Lake",958,971],["Duddon",991,997],["Ravenglass",1227,1237],["Mite",1406,1410],["Ravenglass",1787,1797],["Isle",1821,1825],["Egremont",2093,2101],["Ravenglass",2125,2135],["Egremont",2176,2184],["Ravenglass",2427,2437]],"geonouns":[["water",399,404],["sea",460,463],["shore",464,469],["sea",644,647],["carriage",699,707],["estuary",998,1005],["sea",1033,1036],["land",1100,1104],["port",1219,1223],["sea",1258,1261],["nook",1292,1296],["hall",1330,1334],["rivers",1385,1391],["sea",1602,1605],["land",1616,1620],["streets",1704,1711],["market",1902,1908],["town",1937,1941],["train",2443,2448],["beach",2500,2505],["sea",2510,2513],["hotel",2561,2566],["sands",2605,2610],["sea",2864,2867]],"pos_words":[["good",195,199],["compact",361,368],["wonderful",484,493],["ease",494,498],["strong",511,517],["delight",548,555],["exhilarating",613,625],["breeze",663,669],["sweeping",670,678],["keen",711,715],["beautiful",835,844],["quaint",1212,1218],["beautiful",1516,1525],["strong",1648,1654],["right",1752,1757],["like",1851,1855],["right",1973,1978],["fair",2117,2121],["fair",2341,2345],["serene",2470,2476],["quiet",2624,2629],["fashionable",2676,2687],["love",2712,2716],["delightful",3004,3014]],"neg_words":[["poor",165,169],["sinking",275,282],["wild",455,459],["cheap",931,936],["lose",1015,1019],["crept",2642,2647],["afraid",2747,2753],["rail",2929,2933]],"events":[],"dates":[["this day",972,980],["its day",1891,1898],["some centuries",2004,2018]],"times":[["The first",1446,1455],["the morning",2029,2040]],"distances":[["several miles",1041,1054],["about a mile",1300,1312],["About four miles",2403,2419],["more than ten miles",2824,2843]],"loc_advs":[["there",118,123],["there",295,300],["below",594,599],["there",1060,1065],["there",1439,1444],["there",1764,1769],["there",1992,1997],["beyond",2420,2426],["there",2581,2586],["here",2653,2657],["near",2855,2859]],"spa_preps":[["over",103,107],["about",138,143],["across",388,394],["through",499,506],["through",687,694],["out",770,773],["between",1105,1112],["out",1125,1128],["out",1179,1182],["close",1245,1250],["opposite",1808,1816],["out",2550,2553],["close",2567,2572],["down",2648,2652],["out",2658,2661]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0573476703,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984200001},{"para_id":228,"paragraph":"Now we are at the town of St. Bees, and ecclesiastical students are fluttering about the platform, in their caps and gowns. A little way off to the left, the ancient abbey church nestles at the foot of a green hill, with the new collegiate buildings close by. The same hill runs out westward to where the great headland of St. Bees looks proudly over the sea. St. Bees is said to take its name from Sancta Bega, or Beza, an Irish saint, who founded a nunnery on the site of the present church about the year 650. In Mr. John Linton's admirable\" Hand Book of the West Cumberland Railways,\" I find an interesting legend of St. Bees' foundation,\" extracted from an old manuscript in the Dean and Chapter Library at Carlisle;\" beginning,\" There was a pious, religious lady abbess, and some of her sisters with her, driven in by stormy weather at Whitehaven, and the ship cast away i' the harbour, and so destitute, and so she went to the lady of Egremont Castle for relief. That lady, a godly woman, pitied her distress, and desired her lord to give her some place to dwell in; which he did, at the now St. Bees. And she and her sisters sewed and spinned, and wrought carpets and other work, and lived very godly lives, and gott them much love. She desired Lady Egremont to desire her lord to build them a house, and they would lead a religious life together; and many wolde joine with them if they had but a house and land to live upon. Wherewith the Lady Egremont was very well pleased and spoke to her lord; he had land enough, and sholde give them some to lye up treasure in heaven. And the lord laughed at the ladye and said he would give them as much land as snow fell upon the next morning and mid-summer day. And the morrow looked out at the castle window, on the sea side, two miles from Egremont, all was white with snow for three miles together. And thereupon builded this St. Bees' Abbie, and gave all those lands was snowen unto it, and the Town and Haven of Whitehaven; and sometimes after, all the tithes thereabout, and up the mountains, and Inerdale Forest, eastward, was appropriated to this abbey of St. Bees; which was got by one Mr. Dacres, of kindred to the Lord Dacres; gott a long lease of it at Fall of Abbies, and married one Mrs. Latos, of the Beck Hall, Millom, who afterwards married Squire Wybridge of Clifton, in Westmorland, who purchased the inheritance of the Abbie of the Crowne, and sold it to old Sir John Lowther, who gave it to his younger son, Sir Jon Lowther, Knt. Bart., soon after.\" So runs the legend. St. Bees had its fair share of trouble in the old times. It was utterly destroyed by the Danes; and was always in danger in that wild borderland. It was pillaged by the Scots, under Robert Bruce, when, according to Walter Scott, the prior was\" compelled to say mass with an old hollow oak tree for his stall.\" The following lines are from Wordsworth's poem on St. Bees: -","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["St. Bees",26,34],["St. Bees",323,331],["St. Bees",360,368],["Cumberland",567,577],["St. Bees",621,629],["Dean",684,688],["Carlisle",712,720],["Whitehaven",842,852],["Egremont",942,950],["Castle",951,957],["St. Bees",1099,1107],["Egremont",1258,1266],["Egremont",1453,1461],["Egremont",1793,1801],["St. Bees",1880,1888],["Whitehaven",1968,1978],["St. Bees",2115,2123],["Clifton",2328,2335],["Westmorland",2340,2351],["Lowther",2439,2446],["Lowther",2488,2495],["St. Bees",2542,2550],["Wordsworth",2881,2891],["St. Bees",2902,2910]],"geonouns":[["town",18,22],["abbey",166,171],["church",172,178],["foot",194,198],["hill",210,214],["buildings",240,249],["hill",269,273],["sea",355,358],["church",486,492],["ship",862,866],["house",1302,1307],["house",1405,1410],["land",1415,1419],["land",1514,1518],["land",1653,1657],["castle",1746,1752],["sea",1768,1771],["lands",1916,1921],["mountains",2039,2048],["abbey",2106,2111],["tree",2831,2835],["lines",2866,2871]],"pos_words":[["great",305,310],["saint",430,435],["admirable",534,543],["interesting",599,610],["relief",962,968],["work",1182,1186],["love",1235,1239],["lead",1324,1328],["well",1471,1475],["pleased",1476,1483],["enough",1519,1525],["treasure",1563,1571],["heaven",1575,1581],["fair",2559,2563]],"neg_words":[["stormy",824,830],["destitute",900,909],["distress",1007,1015],["wrought",1156,1163],["fell",1666,1670],["trouble",2573,2580],["utterly",2606,2613],["danger",2656,2662],["wild",2671,2675],["hollow",2820,2826],["stall",2844,2849]],"events":[],"dates":[["about the year 650",493,511],["mid-summer day",1697,1711],["morrow",1721,1727]],"times":[["the next morning",1676,1692]],"distances":[["two miles",1778,1787],["three miles",1831,1842]],"loc_advs":[["left",148,152],["westward",283,291]],"spa_preps":[["about",79,84],["close",250,255],["out",279,282],["over",346,350],["away",872,876],["together",1346,1354],["out",1735,1738],["together",1843,1851],["under",2718,2723]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0103092784,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973298311},{"para_id":229,"paragraph":"\" When Beza sought of yore the Cumbrian coast, Tempestuous winds her holy passage crossed; She knelt in prayer - the waves their wrath appease; And from her vow, well weighed in Heaven's decrees, Rose where she touched the strand, the chantry of St. Bees. **** When her sweet voice, that instrument of love, Was glorified, and took its place, above","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Rose",196,200],["St. Bees",246,254]],"geonouns":[["coast",40,45]],"pos_words":[["holy",69,73],["well",162,166],["sweet",270,275],["love",302,306]],"neg_words":[["wrath",129,134]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["above",343,348]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0857142857,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9970573187},{"para_id":230,"paragraph":"The silent stars, among the angelic quire, Her chantry blazed with sacrilegious fire, And perished utterly; but her good deeds Had sown the spot that witnessed them with seeds, Which lay in earth expectant, till a breeze, With quickening impulse, answered their mute pleas, And lo! a statelier pile, the Abbey of St. Bees.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Abbey",304,309],["St. Bees",313,321]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["silent",4,10],["angelic",28,35],["good",116,120],["breeze",214,220]],"neg_words":[["utterly",99,106],["pleas",267,272]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["among",18,23]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0588235294,"vader_sentiment":0.59,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9825914502},{"para_id":231,"paragraph":"This ancient priory church -","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["church",20,26]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981725216},{"para_id":232,"paragraph":"\" On whose symbolic beauty gazed Peasant and mail-clad chief with pious awe,\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["beauty",20,26],["awe",72,75]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.1818181818,"vader_sentiment":0.59,"roberta_sentiment":0.9965453744},{"para_id":233,"paragraph":"is a very interesting building, of red sandstone. The oldest part of the walls is thickly mantled with ivy. Nothing now remains of the once extensive conventual buildings, except faint traces west of the church. The western entrance is by a fine deep-moulded Norman doorway; and in the interior are preserved many fine fragments of ancient sculpture originally belonging to the abbey. There is a large hotel near the station; but, desiring to see something of the little town, we went up its one long street, and dined at a comfortable hostel, called the\" Queen's Arms.\" Ennerdale Lake is more than a mile nearer from Whitehaven than from St. Bees; and there is a branch line from Whitehaven to Frizzington, within two miles and a half of the lake. From St. Bees it is more than nine miles. The day was short; so we did n't linger, but took out at the north side of the town about four in the afternoon. For about a mile the road wound slantingly up the hill, and we had a fine view of the fertile valley of St. Bees, the church, part of the town, the sea, and the tall headland. About three miles off, north-west, the smoke of Whitehaven made a still gray cloud in the air. When we had got well over the hill-top, the outskirts of Egremont town were just visible, about a mile east of the road. Egremont, or the Mount of Sorrow, is an ancient town, on the west bank of the River Ehen. The ruins of its once famous castle stand upon a mound, a little south-east of the town. This castle was built by William de Meschines, in the reign of William the Conqueror, who granted to him the great barony of Copeland,\" extending between the rivers Duddon and Derwent from north to south, and from east to west, between the mountains and the sea.\" To Ranulph, brother of this baron, the conqueror granted all Cumberland. The ancient tradition of\" The Horn of Egremont\" is connected with the Lucys, lords of the barony in the time of the crusades. Our way led through a fertile country of gentle hills and dales. It is, also, the richest part of the iron ore district, and those red hues which are so familiar to the eye in Furness, are visible here. Roads, houses, carts, horses, and men, -\" subdued to what they work in, like the dyer's hand.\" There are signs of industry and wealth all round. Mines, ironworks, flax-mills, and well-cultivated lands. As we passed through the village of Cleator a heavy shower fell, and we took shelter in an old Irishwoman's cottage. At the hamlet of Wath we lose sight of the open country, and descend a shady steep which brings us to a sheltered nook by the River Ehen, where there is a large old farm-house, which nature has taken a fancy to adorn. Here the vale of Kinniside opens. Daylight was just beginning to think of its decline when we came into this scene. Low down by the Ehen side, our road twines on between hedges crowned with hazel; and now and then the beautiful little river glints through a gap, as we pass by. The stream runs close to the left hand, with just a hedge between it and the road; and its melody rises so sweetly in the air, that the wind seems to stand with its finger on its lip, saying to all the landscape,\" Hush; that I may hear it sing!\" I ran up the hedge now and then, to take another look at the water. This little vale of Kinniside is rich, and soft, and still. Wood and water, hill and dale, are scattered here in exquisite relationship; and there is a retiredness and repose about it, which gives the scene a finishing charm. Now doubt I saw it favourably by that October twilight; and I should not like to forget how beautiful it looked. The little river itself plays lingeringly about its channel there, in pretty childlike ecstasies, as if it thought that valley an uncommonly pleasant spot, and did n't care to run away from it so soon. The stones in its bed, too, are loth to part with the water; they stop it a little wherever they can, holding it in tinkling chat, persuading it to dance, and making it look as lovely as they can before it goes away. We came out upon higher grounds just as the sun began to dip behind the hill. The landscape was\" calm as a resting wheel;\" the air was strangely clear; and a kind of expectant silence dwelt upon all things. The valley lay partly in twilight shade; but upon the hill - side, upon the sloping road before us, and upon the hedge-rows, and bemossed walls thereby, and setting sun's last radiance lay melting away in almost unearthly splendour. When the sun had gone down, clouds, - which seemed to have awaited his departure, - came trooping out of the west; the wind rose wild and strong, and fitful showers came down. By the time we reached the hamlet of Ennerdale Bridge, a dark stormy night was around us. We were yet two miles from the lake. I should like to have seen this mountain hamlet by daylight; but it was not so. Its churchyard is the scene of Wordsworth's poem,\" The Brothers.\" The place may have changed a little since\" the homely priest of Ennerdale\" said:","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Ennerdale Lake",571,585],["Whitehaven",618,628],["St. Bees",639,647],["Whitehaven",681,691],["St. Bees",754,762],["St. Bees",1008,1016],["Whitehaven",1128,1138],["Egremont",1232,1240],["Egremont",1296,1304],["Mount",1313,1318],["River",1374,1379],["Duddon",1640,1646],["Derwent",1651,1658],["Cumberland",1800,1810],["Egremont",1850,1858],["Furness",2114,2121],["River",2586,2591],["Ennerdale Bridge",4681,4697],["Wordsworth",4882,4892],["Ennerdale",4981,4990]],"geonouns":[["building",22,30],["walls",73,78],["buildings",161,170],["church",204,210],["entrance",224,232],["abbey",378,383],["hotel",402,407],["station",417,424],["town",471,475],["street",501,507],["line",671,675],["lake",743,747],["town",870,874],["road",925,929],["hill",954,958],["valley",998,1004],["church",1022,1028],["town",1042,1046],["sea",1052,1055],["hill",1205,1209],["town",1241,1245],["road",1290,1294],["town",1344,1348],["bank",1362,1366],["castle",1415,1421],["town",1469,1473],["castle",1480,1486],["rivers",1633,1639],["mountains",1715,1724],["sea",1733,1736],["country",1968,1975],["hills",1986,1991],["dales",1996,2001],["district",2049,2057],["houses",2148,2154],["lands",2336,2341],["village",2368,2375],["cottage",2451,2458],["hamlet",2467,2473],["country",2508,2515],["nook",2574,2578],["farm",2625,2629],["house",2630,2635],["vale",2687,2691],["road",2825,2829],["river",2913,2918],["gap",2936,2939],["pass",2947,2951],["stream",2960,2966],["road",3033,3037],["landscape",3158,3167],["water",3263,3268],["vale",3282,3286],["water",3339,3344],["hill",3346,3350],["dale",3355,3359],["river",3620,3625],["channel",3661,3668],["valley",3729,3735],["stones",3815,3821],["bed",3829,3832],["water",3865,3870],["grounds",4052,4059],["hill",4100,4104],["landscape",4110,4119],["valley",4239,4245],["hill",4289,4293],["road",4319,4323],["walls",4373,4378],["hamlet",4671,4677],["lake",4765,4769],["mountain",4803,4811],["hamlet",4812,4818]],"pos_words":[["interesting",10,21],["fine",314,318],["desiring",431,439],["comfortable",524,535],["fertile",990,997],["well",1191,1195],["top",1210,1213],["famous",1408,1414],["great",1584,1589],["led",1946,1949],["fertile",1960,1967],["gentle",1979,1985],["work",2204,2208],["like",2213,2217],["well",2320,2324],["fancy",2662,2667],["beautiful",2896,2905],["sweetly",3063,3070],["rich",3303,3307],["soft",3313,3317],["exquisite",3383,3392],["charm",3489,3494],["like",3569,3573],["beautiful",3588,3597],["pretty",3679,3685],["ecstasies",3696,3705],["pleasant",3750,3758],["lovely",3988,3994],["calm",4125,4129],["clear",4173,4178],["radiance",4411,4419],["strong",4606,4612],["like",4780,4784]],"neg_words":[["faint",179,184],["wound",930,935],["smoke",1119,1124],["cloud",1157,1162],["ruins",1390,1395],["subdued",2183,2190],["fell",2402,2406],["lose",2485,2489],["shady",2531,2536],["steep",2537,2542],["decline",2756,2763],["hedge",3008,3013],["hedge",3215,3220],["doubt",3500,3505],["strangely",4163,4172],["hedge",4348,4353],["wild",4597,4601],["dark",4701,4705],["stormy",4706,4712]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",239,245],["the\"",551,555],["The day",791,798],["a fine",971,977],["a still",1144,1151],["October",3534,3541]],"times":[["the afternoon",889,902],["night",4713,4718]],"distances":[["more than a mile",589,605],["two miles and a half",715,735],["more than nine miles",769,789],["about a mile",908,920],["About three miles",1080,1097],["about a mile",1265,1277],["two miles",4746,4755]],"loc_advs":[["near",408,412],["there",653,658],["between",1621,1628],["here",2135,2139],["there",2604,2609],["between",2840,2847],["left",2985,2989],["here",3375,3379],["there",3411,3416],["there",3669,3674],["away",4022,4026],["behind",4089,4095]],"spa_preps":[["within",708,714],["out",841,844],["about",875,880],["over",1196,1200],["between",1703,1710],["through",1950,1957],["round",2279,2284],["through",2356,2363],["into",2777,2781],["down",2798,2802],["through",2926,2933],["close",2972,2977],["between",3014,3021],["about",3445,3450],["about",3651,3656],["away",3789,3793],["out",4036,4039],["away",4432,4436],["down",4490,4494],["out",4566,4569],["down",4638,4642],["around",4723,4729]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0289855072,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981766939},{"para_id":234,"paragraph":"\" In our churchyard Is neither epitaph nor monument, Tombstone nor name - only the turf we tread And a few natural graves. ** The dead man's home Is but a fellow to that pasture field. **** We have no need of names and epitaphs: We talk about the dead at our fire-sides. ** On a winter evening, If you were seated at my chimney's nook, By turning over these hillocks one by one, We two could travel, sir, through a strange round; Yet all in the broad highway of the world.

At last we chose the road that seemed most travelled, and it turned out right. The rising moon sent a tinge of wild light through the clouds, and we could dimly see the steeps of half - concealed mountains. In the black profound between, we heard the lake lashing its rocky shore; but nothing of it was visible. The scene was gloomily grand. I would not exchange the robe of stormy darkness which Ennerdale wore that night for all that sunlight can do to make it gay. The wild changes of weird light which stole from the moon through those flying clouds made the view more savage still. We laboured along the splashy road, through everything that makes a man damp, but the wild sublimity of the scene repaid for all. Our road led through a miry farm - yard, from which we emerged by great folding-doors upon a slope, down which the path continues to the water-side. The clouds broke a little again, and we caught sight of the gables of the Boathouse Inn below. It sounded strange, in such a scene, to hear the jolting of a cart, and people singing as blithely as if they were taking the last road home from a harvest field. They had evidently been\" calling\" somewhere in the wilderness. They passed us with a boisterous\" Good night,\" and went singing into the gloom behind. A clatter of hoofs next came up, and we had to stand aside, as a tall figure, on a great horse, dashed through the mist, like a moss-trooper riding home from a midnight foray. A few minutes more found us inside the Boathouse; and the wind whistled through the lock hole after us, as if it wanted to come in and dry the mist off its wings. The house was cheerful as the scene was wild, - a comfortable kernel in a stormy shell. The kitchen was a large clean room looking into another, in which a matronly woman and her grown-up daughter were busy among butter and milk-bowls. The landlord and two young shepherds were basking by the fire, with their dogs about them. Everything in the place evinced plenty, and cleanly, homely care. We were at home with these hearty mountaineers in a minute, and the women began to prepare a kind of dinner with tea to it. In the meantime we went outside to look at the lake. The clouds are breaking into detached masses - all flying earnestly in one direction - like knots of Chartists hurrying to a great meeting. Between these flying masses the clam blue sky begins to shew itself; and the moon is up. Now hidden behind a dusky cloud, her brilliance overflows its border with a silvery fringe; now, as she sails into sight, the rocky mountains soften in her smile; now, full and fair, upon the open blue, she floods the landscape with queenly radiance, and all the world grows tenderly beautiful beneath her pensive spell. But look at the lonely lake: it is alive with enchantments! In this sheltered corner little eddies of shimmering silver flit about, - the dainty Ariels of moonlit water; there, is a burnished islet of stirless brilliance, in which even the moon smiles to see herself look so passing fair; and, out beyond, the wide waters are in a tremulous fever of delight with her sweet influence. But now a great fit of cloud comes on, and all is gloom again. If there be magic in the world, it is this! When it cleared again, we took a boat. The landlord cautioned us not to pull far out, or we should find it difficult to get back again that night. We pulled to and fro about the broadest end of the lake, between the mountain called\" Herdhouse,\" on the north, and the rock called\" Angling Crag,\" which is overtopped by Revelin on the south. Near Angling Crag a little islet of stones rise from the lake. As oft as we approached these stones, we found that the stormy wind had such a forcible sweep the whole length of the narrow lake, that it was best to return. It was a wild scene from the water that night. One minute Crag Fell, Revelin, and Herdhouse were lit up to their summits by the moon; the next they were all gloom, and half - concealed by drifting mists. We pulled till we were tired, then tethered the boat, and went to tea. It was a spread that would have done credit to any inn in Christendie. The window of the room where it was set out looked upon the lake. After tea, we went to roost with a will. Our bedroom was scrupulously clean, and even more tastefully furnished than is common at good inns in large towns. But,\" Good night!\" God bless the man that invented beds!","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Ennerdale",852,861],["Crag",3967,3971],["Crag",4032,4036],["Crag Fell",4299,4308]],"geonouns":[["path",210,214],["roads",234,239],["post",350,354],["road",476,480],["mountains",651,660],["lake",706,710],["shore",729,734],["road",1072,1076],["road",1176,1180],["farm",1200,1204],["doors",1252,1257],["slope",1265,1270],["path",1287,1291],["water",1309,1314],["road",1547,1551],["field",1572,1577],["house",2072,2077],["lake",2632,2636],["mountains",2999,3008],["landscape",3085,3094],["lake",3211,3215],["water",3351,3356],["waters",3503,3509],["boat",3712,3716],["lake",3877,3881],["mountain",3895,3903],["rock",3946,3950],["stones",4055,4061],["lake",4076,4080],["stones",4112,4118],["lake",4207,4211],["water",4270,4275],["summits",4354,4361],["boat",4493,4497],["inn",4567,4570],["lake",4647,4651],["common",4773,4779],["inns",4788,4792],["towns",4802,4807],["beds",4860,4864]],"pos_words":[["right",527,532],["profound",675,683],["grand",790,795],["led",1181,1184],["great",1238,1243],["great",1812,1817],["like",1850,1854],["cheerful",2082,2090],["comfortable",2118,2129],["clean",2180,2185],["cleanly",2439,2446],["earnestly",2696,2705],["like",2725,2729],["great",2763,2768],["brilliance",2904,2914],["smile",3023,3028],["fair",3044,3048],["radiance",3108,3116],["tenderly",3142,3150],["beautiful",3151,3160],["shimmering",3290,3300],["brilliance",3398,3408],["smiles",3433,3439],["fair",3471,3475],["delight",3538,3545],["sweet",3555,3560],["great",3582,3587],["magic",3647,3652],["cleared",3687,3694],["best",4225,4229],["clean",4723,4728],["good",4783,4787],["bless",4832,4837]],"neg_words":[["wild",9,13],["dark",15,19],["rage",171,175],["broken",337,343],["battered",365,373],["stranger",392,400],["dumb",405,409],["wild",566,570],["rocky",723,728],["stormy",830,836],["darkness",837,845],["wild",927,931],["weird",943,948],["stole",961,966],["savage",1028,1034],["wild",1128,1132],["broke",1332,1337],["strange",1427,1434],["boisterous",1664,1674],["gloom",1715,1720],["mist",1844,1848],["mist",2048,2052],["wild",2108,2112],["stormy",2142,2148],["breaking",2653,2661],["cloud",2893,2898],["rocky",2993,2998],["lonely",3204,3210],["fever",3529,3534],["cloud",3595,3600],["gloom",3622,3627],["difficult",3786,3795],["stormy",4138,4144],["wild",4250,4254],["gloom",4398,4403],["mists",4438,4443],["tired",4468,4473]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["that night",867,877],["night",1681,1686],["a midnight",1887,1897],["A few minutes",1905,1918],["a minute",2511,2519],["that night",3814,3824],["that night",4276,4286],["One minute",4288,4298],["night",4820,4825]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["nowhere",446,453],["below",1409,1414],["home",1552,1556],["somewhere",1613,1622],["home",1877,1881],["home",2472,2476],["behind",2878,2884],["there",3358,3363],["beyond",3486,3492],["there",3638,3643]],"spa_preps":[["between",58,65],["over",195,199],["out",523,526],["through",577,584],["between",684,691],["through",981,988],["along",1054,1059],["through",1078,1085],["through",1185,1192],["down",1272,1276],["into",1706,1710],["behind",1721,1727],["aside",1782,1787],["through",1832,1839],["inside",1933,1939],["through",1977,1984],["into",2199,2203],["among",2275,2280],["about",2383,2388],["outside",2609,2616],["into",2662,2666],["into",2977,2981],["beneath",3161,3168],["about",3313,3318],["out",3482,3485],["out",3760,3763],["about",3847,3852],["between",3883,3890],["out",4627,4630]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0087719298,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9562758803},{"para_id":239,"paragraph":"Chapter The Fifth.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9359796643},{"para_id":240,"paragraph":"\" Scenes Where savage grandeur wakes an awful thrill.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["grandeur",22,30],["thrill",46,52]],"neg_words":[["savage",15,21],["awful",40,45]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.38,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9985463619},{"para_id":241,"paragraph":"Wordsworth","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Wordsworth",0,10]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9192555547},{"para_id":242,"paragraph":"Our clothes had been dried and put into comfortable trim overnight; and when we rose from sleep a crisp October morning was steeping the mountain tops in splendour.

The only signs of cultivation about it are on its western shore; the rest of the scene is all barren crags. About midway upon this western shore, the Boathouse Inn stands, and commands a good view of the broadest part of the water, and of the encircling mountains. About a mile from the inn, the lake narrows, and winds out of sight between Herdhouse and Revelin; and the water beyond this point lies in a scene of solitary sublimity. At the head of the wide narrow vale beyond the lake, Great Gable rises, 2925 feet, closing the landscape magnificently; and on the south side the vale is bounded by the mountain called Pillar, 2893 feet high. Strangers are strongly advised to climb the summit of Red Pike, on the north side of the lake, from where there is a fine prospect, commanding views of the five lakes, Ennerdale, Buttermere, Crummock Water, Lowes Water and Derwent Water. Ennerdale lake supplies the town of Whitehaven, and its waters are said to be the purest in the north of England. The mountains seen from the Boathouse inn are Herdhouse and Bowness Knot, on the north side; and Revelin and Iron Crag on the south. Steeple and Pillar are in sight also east of these. Pillar takes its name from a lofty, precipitous rock,\" rising like a column from the vale\" at the head of the lake. The rock is a remarkable feature of the grand mountain to which it gives a name. \" It was considered inaccessible until the year 1826, when and adventurous shepherd clambered to the summit. Since then it has been several time ascended. The prospect from the top of the mountain is extremely noble.\" In Wordsworth's poem,\" The Brothers,\" the old priest of Ennerdale tells of a young dalesman who wandered one May morning up this mountain with his companions. He had lingered behind the rest, and was missed by them, until, returning, they spied him stretched at ease upon the aery summit of this fearful crag. Not thinking any ill they went home without him; but next morning the wanderer was still unheard of. The neighbours were alarmed, and the missing youth was sought for, high and low.

Our way was a shepherd's track, over the north-western mountain pass, by the edge of Floutern Tarn, and so down, on the right hand, Between Melbreak and Blea Crag, to Buttermere, a walk of six miles. We had not gone half a mile before we missed the way, and got to the little hamlet of Bowness, at the north-western corner of the lake. Here we inquired again, at a shepherd's cottage, where two dogs rushed out upon us. An old wife came forth, and, pointing up in the same direction we had been shewn before, she said,\" Mak t' best gate ye can up by t' lift hond side o' this beck, till ye cum tull a sheep-track ower between t' fell-tops. Then gang on by t' track, an' hug t' beck till ye cum to Floutern Tarn. When ye cum to that, lig weel tull it, or ye'll git wrang. Then gang forret down by t' seam track, an' clip tereight hond mountain gaily, till ye cum to Scale Force,, an' then ye'll see Buttermer reight afore ye.\" Thanking the old woman, we struck up the rocky moorland steep. After a hard and slippery climb, we came upon the track, but it was often so dim that we had some difficulty in keeping it. This bleak pass was all trembling swamp, soaked with the recent rains; and though we kept the track pretty well, such as it was, there was more wading than dry walking in it. A last, after about three miles' tramp, Floutern Tarn came in sight, on our right hand, nestling in the gloomy shade of Herdhouse. To anyone going this way, Floutern Tarn is one of the principal guiding-marks, and he must take heed of it. There is nothing very remarkable in this cheerless sheet of water, except its extreme loneliness. This little hermit of the mountains looks up to heaven from its rocky bed with ascetic eye, as if it would rather be absorbed there than mingle with the vain pleasures of this world's busy waters. At Floutern Tarn we come to the eastern edge of the pass; and down in the eastern vale, three miles off, we get a glimpse of the green land which divides Buttermere from Crummock Water. The mountains too, seen from this point, are very grand. We now began to descend the steep, keeping as well as possible to the track, which wanders bewilderingly along the base of the right hand mountains, Herdhouse and Blea Crag. Our descent was a mixture of sliding, jumping, wading, running, and scratching, - with an enlivening tumble, dropt in no and then, to give the whole a finishing flavour, and make it go down better. We lost the main path so oft, that, at last, we gave it up altogether, and went ahead the best way we could, taking advantage of any little sheep-walk that led our way. It was a rough bit of travelling, but we got through it merrily. Above two miles down from Floutern tarn, the southern corner of Crummock Water becomes visible; and Scale Force is on the right hand, a long silver line, shining between the lofty crags, and partly shrouded by scanty foliage. Not feeling inclined to go up to the fall, we went forward to the foot of Red Pike, and so across to Buttermere. The little hamlet of Buttermere is scattered about a gentle slope, at the base of Whiteside, and near the foot of the lake. The road to Keswick leads up from it, over Buttermere Haws, 800 feet high, and then through the vale of Newlands. The hamlet stands on the east side of a stripe of cultivated land, which divides the twin lakes of Buttermere and Crummock, and on which three or four farmhouses are straggled about the fields. This little isthmus of green land, with its tufts of trees, and the hamlet at its side, contrasts pleasantly with the steep and lofty mountains which gather around these waters. The mountains here are among the highest and wildest in Cumberland; Mellbreak, Whiteside, Grassmoor, Ladhouse, Whiteless Pike, Robinson, Yew Crag, Honister, the Hay Stacks, High Crag, High Stile, and Red Pike, - these are the guardians of the vale in which Buttermere and Crummock Water lie. Crummock water is three miles long by three quarters of a mile broad; and Buttermere is one mile and a quarter long by half a mile broad. There is a splendid view of these two lakes, and of the encircling mountains, from a place called\" The Knots,\" about three hundred yards from the Victoria Inn, in Buttermere. The mountains, however, cannot be so well seen anywhere as from the bosom of Crummock Water. Seen from that lake, Melbreak is remarkably fine, and\" Whiteside and Grassmoor are majestic in the highest degree.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Buttermere",41,51],["Floutern Tarn",138,151],["Melbreak",193,201],["Blea Crag",206,215],["Buttermere",220,230],["Bowness",339,346],["Floutern Tarn",750,763],["Scale Force,",918,930],["Floutern Tarn",1381,1394],["Floutern Tarn",1498,1511],["Floutern Tarn",1878,1891],["Buttermere",2029,2039],["Crummock Water",2045,2059],["Blea Crag",2281,2290],["Crummock Water",2788,2802],["Scale Force",2824,2835],["Red Pike",3024,3032],["Buttermere",3051,3061],["Buttermere",3084,3094],["Whiteside",3145,3154],["Keswick",3199,3206],["Buttermere",3230,3240],["Haws",3241,3245],["Newlands",3291,3299],["Buttermere",3400,3410],["Crummock",3415,3423],["Cumberland",3729,3739],["Mellbreak",3741,3750],["Whiteside",3752,3761],["Grassmoor",3763,3772],["Pike",3794,3798],["Yew Crag",3810,3818],["Honister",3820,3828],["High Crag",3846,3855],["High Stile",3857,3867],["Red Pike",3873,3881],["Buttermere",3930,3940],["Crummock Water",3945,3959],["Crummock",3965,3973],["Buttermere",4039,4049],["Buttermere",4266,4276],["Crummock Water",4355,4369],["Melbreak",4392,4400],["Whiteside",4426,4435],["Grassmoor",4440,4449]],"geonouns":[["track",78,83],["mountain",108,116],["pass",117,121],["edge",130,134],["hamlet",329,335],["lake",383,387],["cottage",429,436],["gate",585,589],["beck",629,633],["track",660,665],["track",712,717],["beck",730,734],["track",857,862],["mountain",887,895],["track",1092,1097],["pass",1177,1181],["track",1260,1265],["water",1640,1645],["mountains",1704,1713],["bed",1748,1751],["waters",1867,1873],["edge",1915,1919],["pass",1927,1931],["vale",1957,1961],["land",2010,2014],["mountains",2065,2074],["point",2095,2100],["track",2188,2193],["mountains",2256,2265],["path",2507,2511],["tarn",2759,2763],["line",2872,2876],["crags",2904,2909],["foot",3016,3020],["hamlet",3074,3080],["slope",3123,3128],["foot",3169,3173],["lake",3181,3185],["road",3191,3195],["vale",3283,3287],["hamlet",3305,3311],["land",3362,3366],["lakes",3391,3396],["fields",3487,3493],["land",3524,3528],["trees",3548,3553],["hamlet",3563,3569],["mountains",3629,3638],["waters",3665,3671],["mountains",3677,3686],["vale",3916,3920],["water",3974,3979],["lakes",4141,4146],["mountains",4170,4179],["mountains",4282,4291],["lake",4386,4390]],"pos_words":[["right",173,178],["best",580,584],["tops",687,691],["hug",723,726],["gaily",896,901],["pretty",1266,1272],["well",1273,1277],["right",1417,1422],["remarkable",1602,1612],["heaven",1726,1732],["grand",2111,2116],["well",2164,2168],["right",2245,2250],["better",2482,2488],["best",2580,2584],["advantage",2606,2615],["led",2646,2649],["merrily",2715,2722],["right",2846,2851],["gentle",3116,3122],["leads",3207,3212],["pleasantly",3593,3603],["splendid",4114,4122],["well",4315,4319],["remarkably",4404,4414],["fine",4415,4419],["majestic",4454,4462]],"neg_words":[["missed",291,297],["fell",682,686],["struck",1006,1012],["rocky",1020,1025],["steep",1035,1040],["hard",1050,1054],["dim",1119,1122],["difficulty",1140,1150],["bleak",1171,1176],["tramp",1374,1379],["gloomy",1445,1451],["cheerless",1621,1630],["loneliness",1666,1676],["rocky",1742,1747],["vain",1831,1835],["steep",2146,2151],["bewilderingly",2209,2222],["tumble",2393,2399],["lost",2493,2497],["rough",2668,2673],["shrouded",2922,2930],["steep",3613,3618],["lie",3960,3963]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fall",2983,2991],["about a",3108,3115],["three quarters",4003,4017],["a quarter",4066,4075]],"times":[],"distances":[["six miles",242,251],["half a mile",269,280],["about three miles",1355,1372],["three miles",1963,1974],["two miles",2730,2739],["800 feet",3247,3255],["three miles",3983,3994],["a mile",4021,4027],["one mile",4053,4061],["half a mile",4084,4095]],"loc_advs":[["there",1295,1300],["there",1804,1809],["forward",3001,3008],["across",3041,3047],["near",3160,3164],["here",3687,3691],["anywhere",4325,4333]],"spa_preps":[["out",33,36],["over",85,89],["down",160,164],["out",460,463],["between",671,678],["down",841,845],["down",1937,1941],["along",2223,2228],["down",2477,2481],["ahead",2570,2575],["through",2704,2711],["down",2740,2744],["between",2886,2893],["over",3225,3229],["through",3271,3278],["about",3477,3482],["around",3652,3658],["among",3696,3701],["about",4214,4219]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0090293454,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9959750772},{"para_id":250,"paragraph":"There are two inns now at Buttermere - the Victoria and the Fish.

Seen from this spot, that mighty amphitheatre of precipitous rock is a sublime sight. A Gatesgarth guides may be had. The day was getting far spent, and I had the old Ennerdale landlady's advice in mind about losing our way. But there was not a guide at home. The last had gone with a man to Wastdale some time before; and the girl said we should very likely meet him returning. The toughest part of the journey was still before us, and there was nothing for it but to set to work. As we toiled up Scarf Gap, Honister Crag grew ever more awfully impressive. Its frowning solitude was more widely and distinctly under the eye, marked with wandering streaks of white, where the waters came down from wildernesses too savage for anything but storm and cloud to abide. We panted up. The last nook of Buttermere Lake glided out of sight, and the valley disappeared. Higher yet, we climbed and twined among scattered rocks, whilst on each hand steep crags glared sternly down through the mist. On the crown of the pass, we came to a little platform of swampy land, where the track grew faint, and began to branch off this way and that, always ending in impassable bog, or in some untrodden part of the solitude. The wind blew wild and chill, and great clouds of thick mist folded us so completely in their damp embrace, that we were getting wet through, and sometimes could hardly see a yard before us. At last we caught sight of the path disappearing upon the edge of the mountain; and we rattled down into the glen through which the River Liza runs from Great Gable to Ennerdale Water. A tall young shepherd was coming up the mountain, with a plaid on his shoulder and a long staff in his hand. This was the guide of whom they spoke at Gatesgarth. I was inclined to take him to Ennerdale with us, but my friend put a good face on the matter, and thought we should manage very well. The guide pointed to a solitary little tree up the glen, and near the foot of Black Sail, telling us that we should find the path to Wastdale on this side of it. It seemed easy enough to get there, so we set off again with a will, not thinking of the mosses, waters, slaps, and boggy bewilderments that lay between us and our aim. Down we went, over rocks, shingles, and\" slape places;\" and through spongy deceitful spots, where lurking waters made the mountain green with swamp verdure. In the hollow our path was dim, splashy, and erratic. At last we came to a ruined cottage, nearly opposite the tree before mentioned. Here we lost the path again, and found also that the River Liza was between us and Black Sail. Whichever way we turned the swamp began to swallow us as if it was hungry. Night was coming on; fits of heavy rain began to fall; and mist-laden winds raged savagely around as if they were glad to catch us in such a place at such a time. We found that we must move on at once or be benighted there, which would have put an unpleasant finish to that day's journey. Dashing recklessly through the swamp, we waded the stream, and clambered over the rocks, as straight as possible towards the tree. We drew near it, and looked about; but the dark steep seemed pathless. We went nearer, and, to our delight perceived a narrow path, about a hundred yards to the right of the tree. Wet, and hot with exertion, we paused to take breath. If we could keep this track, there would be just about daylight enough to see us over the mountain. We found this pass wilder than Scarf Gap, but we worked in that howling storm, up to the top, when the rain ceased, and we felt comparatively comfortable. After our difficulties that wild October nightfall, I was not much surprised to find that\" Black's Guide\" calls this route to Wastdale\" so perplexing, that although the hardy pedestrian, with very minute directions, might succeed in finding his way over the mountains, yet every one who has crossed them will be aware of the danger of the attempt, and of the fatal consequences attending a diversion from the right path.\" After this, the following passage from a letter to the editor, appear in the same volume: -\" The passes at Scarf Gap and Black Sail should not be attempted late in the season without a guide, for the following reasons: A friend and myself left the inn at Buttermere this morning, on our way to Wastdale, in a heavy rain, being pressed for time. We reached the summit at Scarf Gap, and descended into the Ennerdale valley with tolerable success, in spite of a cold north-east wind and driving rain; we also ascended Black Sail about half way, when my friend's pony, a hardy and powerful animal, came to a standstill. I then pushed on alone, on foot, to find a better track for the pony, and had attained so close to the summit as to see the platform, as it were, within my reach, when prolonged wet and cold produced such severe numbness and faintness, that I had barely strength to return to my companion, whom I found very little better off than myself. But for a flask of brandy in his bag, I do not think that we could have ever left the valley alive; as it was, we had barely power to make our way through the swamps, rocks, and swollen torrents of the Liza.

From the summit of Black Sail the road was more distinct, and not so steep; and there was more of what dalesmen call\" green travelling\" about it. In some places, however, the rain had made it as much a river as a road. We descended rapidly, crossing from point to point of the winding path; and being already wet and soiled, a boot-full of water, or a slip in the swamp, was no great matter. A mountain torrent roared down this wild pass, between Pillar on the right, and Kirkfell on the left. When we came into that part of Wastdale Head called Mosedale, the sublime appearance of Pillar was such as I cannot express. The expiring light of day was struggling with the still hovering storm; and through the clouds a strange, unearthly light settled upon the awful summit and steeps of that mountain, which, somehow, called Horeb and Sinai to mind. A mile's walk from the foot of the pass brought us to the Huntsman's Inn, the house of William Ritson, the well-known guide at Wastdale Head. Wet and weary we walked in at the kitchen door, just as night was lapping the wild mountains in its overpowering gloom. A servant girl was placing candles on a long, heavy table under the window, by which four men sat waiting for their supper. The storm was rising again, and the wind roared in the wide chimney as if it was challenging the fire to come and have a round with it outside; but the cheerful house-warmer went on with its play, and looked round with a graceful smile as if it wished above all things that Mrs. Ritson would bring more pans with meat in, that it might set to and cook something for the good of the company. The fender was one half of a heavy tram-wheel. In a corner, at the table end, a thoughtful-looking man, in military undress, sat turning over some papers. He belonged to the ordinance service. A very tall, stark man, about sixty, sat on a low chair by the fire. His wiry hair was sprinkled with grey, and his long, weather-worn face beamed with manly benevolence. A little white-headed lad stood between his knees, playing with a book. Muttering to himself, he climbed the old man's limbs, unbuttoned his waistcoat, and poked his fingers into his ears, like a kitten teasing a Newfoundland dog. \" Fadder, what's this?\" and\" Fadder, look here!\" said he, with all the healthy restlessness of a child\" that feels its life in every limb.\" The old man was talking to someone else, and he took little heed, till the lad pulled his hair, the wrong way, which made hm wince. He then set him down on the floor, and said,\" Lile lads should be varra still when folk's talking.\" The lad was still for a minute or two, and then he bagan again, -\" Fadder; - fadder, see yo. Aa can say that off by heart. Fadder, it is n't bedtime yet, is it?\" \" Well,\" said his father,\" that just depends whether lile lads are quiet or not. Hesto hed thi poddish?\" \" Aye.\" \" Well then, thoo must behave thisen, like a good boy, or else thoo'll hev to gan to bed at yance, now.\" The little fellow retreated, pouting, towards his mother, and muttered,\" Ye du swagger becos yer my fadder!\" This hale old man was William Ritson, the Wastdale guide. Opposite to him sat Jackson, the Barrowdale guide, a square-built, strong man, with a round face. He had brought a gentleman over Sty Head pass, early in the evening. Behind Ritson, a stout young fellow, with a flushed countenance, was smoking and swinging back and forward upon the hind legs of his chair. The called him\" Willie the Waller.\" He was a stone-mason;\" a girt awkertly fell-heed da\u00e0l lad,\" and, as I learned afterwards,\" a gay good hand at levelling rough lumps o' cheese.\" A fine young fox-hound, called\" Crowner,\" was snuffing about the kitchen, and a staid-looking sheep-dog, called\" Boy,\" lay asleep before the fire. The two guides were talking about food for dogs. \" Poddish an' milk,\" said Ritson,\" poddish an' milk for dogs! It keeps em reight. Now, a pound o' meal a day would sarra thooar lile dogs varra weel - thou.\" \" Aye, varra weel,\" said Jackson. And thus the talk went on during the time we stayed in the kitchen. Te storm was raging again outside, and every time the door opened the wet blast swept fiercely in. We went to bed early, intending to go down Wast Water in a boat next morning, and so forward to Drigg. But we will say something more about Wastdale Head in another chapter.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Black Sail",208,218],["Pillar",636,642],["Kirkfell",661,669],["Wastdale Head",714,727],["Mosedale",735,743],["Pillar",771,777],["Wastdale Head",1164,1177],["Wastdale",3312,3320],["Barrowdale",3361,3371],["Sty Head",3458,3466],["Wast Water",4413,4423],["Wastdale Head",4510,4523]],"geonouns":[["passes",181,187],["summit",198,204],["road",223,227],["river",391,396],["road",402,406],["point",444,449],["point",453,458],["winding",466,473],["path",474,478],["water",529,534],["mountain",583,591],["pass",622,626],["summit",953,959],["mountain",979,987],["foot",1060,1064],["pass",1072,1076],["house",1115,1120],["door",1221,1225],["mountains",1262,1271],["table",1351,1356],["house",1584,1589],["table",1881,1886],["bed",3141,3144],["pass",3467,3471],["stone",3680,3685],["door",4325,4329],["bed",4381,4384],["boat",4429,4433]],"pos_words":[["like",11,15],["fine",72,76],["desirable",97,106],["work",153,157],["great",567,572],["right",650,655],["sublime",749,756],["well-known",1144,1154],["cheerful",1575,1583],["warmer",1590,1596],["graceful",1644,1652],["smile",1653,1658],["good",1793,1797],["thoughtful",1894,1904],["benevolence",2165,2176],["like",2367,2371],["healthy",2480,2487],["quiet",3010,3015],["like",3094,3098],["good",3101,3105],["hale",3275,3279],["strong",3395,3401],["good",3768,3772],["fine",3817,3821]],"neg_words":[["dark",28,32],["stranger",113,121],["steep",258,263],["torrent",592,599],["wild",617,621],["struggling",838,848],["strange",905,912],["awful",947,952],["weary",1187,1192],["wild",1257,1261],["gloom",1292,1297],["challenging",1504,1515],["stark",2020,2025],["worn",2137,2141],["restlessness",2488,2500],["wrong",2649,2654],["wince",2674,2679],["retreated",3179,3188],["swagger",3240,3247],["fell",3710,3714],["rough",3791,3796],["staid",3895,3900],["raging",4284,4290]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",830,833],["a day",4114,4119]],"times":[["just as night",1227,1240],["a minute",2803,2811],["early in the evening",3473,3493],["next morning",4434,4446]],"distances":[["A mile",1037,1043]],"loc_advs":[["there",269,274],["left",677,681],["between",2210,2217],["here",2451,2455],["forward",3594,3601],["outside",4297,4304],["forward",4455,4462]],"spa_preps":[["about",325,330],["down",607,611],["between",628,635],["into",696,700],["through",884,891],["under",1357,1362],["round",1544,1549],["outside",1558,1565],["round",1631,1636],["above",1675,1680],["over",1951,1955],["about",2031,2036],["into",2352,2356],["down",2697,2701],["round",3414,3419],["over",3453,3457],["about",3870,3875],["about",3990,3995],["down",4408,4412],["about",4504,4509]],"normalised_sentiment":0.002016129,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9919368029},{"para_id":255,"paragraph":"Chapter The Sixth.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9554745555},{"para_id":256,"paragraph":"\" By my halidome, A scene so rude, so wild as this, Yet so sublime in barrenness, Never did my wandering footsteps press, Wherever I happed to roam.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["sublime",59,66]],"neg_words":[["rude",29,33],["wild",38,42]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0625,"vader_sentiment":-0.59,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984486103},{"para_id":257,"paragraph":"Scott.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9946148992},{"para_id":258,"paragraph":"When morning came we found a great storm raging through Wastdale Head.

The heavy rain blinded our window with its fierce assault; and the mist was so dense that we could see no more of the landscape than a little nooks of the garden below, in which a few currant bushes were struggling frantically to keep hold of the ground they grew in. A sound of rushing waters mingled with the elemental din, rising wildly in the surrounding gloom whenever the hurricane paused a minute to take breath. The swollen torrent form Kirkfell went madly by the rear of the house, too big for its bed; and every channel that seamed the rocky steeps around was full of wild water. When the misty curtains parted an instant, we could see the white currents dashing down the dark side of Yewbarrow, close by the house. This storm continued through the whole day, and all who had passed the night at the\" Huntsman's Inn\" were weather - bound.

We tell' t him that his comrade had sent us wi' summat for him to eat an' drink, but he kept saying' No, no; aa hev nae money!' Ye see, he was terrible freeten't at we was efter his money. At last, we gat a sup o' wine int'll him, an' a bite o' summat to eat. But, when we gat him into t' sun, t' poor fellow was varra ill, sure-ly.

He could jump twelve yards in three jumps, with a great stone in each hand.

We agreed to wait till noon. My friend sat down to read whilst I wandered about stables, shippons, and bracken-bedded yards, tooting into the nooks of the outbuildings. One corner especially interested me; it was a dusty little library of eloquent symbols - a doorless shed, with a low wooden floor above, up to which a short, rough ladder led. The place was crammed with peat, firewood, brackens, cart gear, staves, dairy utensils, old pieces of house furniture, sacks, ropes, oars, fishing nets, alpen-stocks, scythes, and tumbled heaps of cobwebbed rustic lumber. Everything there was a little volume written over with quaint records of lonely mountain life, and the musty air inside seemed thick with country story. I pored over this nook with pleasure, and as there was not much of the landscape to be seen, I spent most of the forenoon roaming about that simple, but roomy and comfortable old house. The shrubs and bushes in the garden had got over their stormy troubles, and were now swaying quietly in the quiet wind.

This lake is three miles and a half long, and half a mile broad. Its depth is about forty - five fathoms. As we went on, the sky became clearer, and the whole length of that solemn water lay still before us. The entire opposite shore was over-frowned by the dark precipitous ridge of rock called\" The Screes,\" rising sheer from the lake, savage and sublime, till hovering mists hid the summits, leaving imagination to build the crags beyond, as lofty and as wild as it had power to soar and shape them. But the shore along which we walked was a different scene. On the left hand, the ripple of Wast Water upon its pebbled shore attended us all the way. On the right, picturesque moorlands sloped aloft irregularly to where sterile crags were lapped in cloud. All over these lower slopes beds of moss, heather and fern, - one glowing vernal sunset, - interspersed with many - tinted rocks, covered the mountain side with splendid hues. Now and then, a little silver rill ran across the road, easily stridden over; and in some places, a larger streamlet dashed beneath, in noisy glee, bridged over by the road. As we went on, some parts of the shore were fringed with tall, thich bushes of gorse, looking freshly green after the rain; and green mounds, of all shapes, began to appear, with mossy rocks cropping out beautifully upon them. The gloomy\" Screes\" still overawe the opposite shore. We are drawing near the foot of Wast Water. The wind has gone down, and murmurs of quiet water are heard around.

He will, very likely, think it a bleak prospect; but a little way westward over that rocky upland, there is a secluded land of corn and cream, of bosky dells, and lush pastures, rolling in irregular green waves, between the hills of Trowbarrow and Middlebarrow, down to the Morecambe shore. The life of this retired spot is all rural repose. The pike-fisher loves to dream by the side of its lonely tarn. The sportsman's gun is often heard in its woods and vales; for it is a pleasant place to him. And, sometimes, the foxhunter's horn wakes the echoes of the rocky heights which bound the scene. This, however, is a comparatively rare sound there; but, when it is heard, the farmer leaves his land, and the fisherman his creel, to follow the chase a-foot, until\" tailed-off\" by the length of the run. But, at ordinary times, and when the sea is asleep, the sounds in Silverdale are of a quiet kind. The stranger wandering there may hear a dog bark, or a cock crow, now and then; and sometimes a cart goes jolting slowly by. A cheery babble a fireside talk may reach him as he passes some solitary homestead; he may be startled by the dinless pad of a bare-footed fisherman returning from the sea; he may hear the low of cattle, or a ploughman's whistle, and that unpremeditated minstrelsy of the woods which is hardly ever quite at rest there; but ruder sounds than these will rarely reach his listening ear. ** Some parts of Silverdale are as lonely yet as when the tramp of Roman legions startled the wolf and hill-fox in the wild woods of Trowbarrow. *** It is a land of brown fishers, fleet footmen, and ploughmen famous in the north of England. Its mighty sands are stored with disasters of the sea; its rocky shores with superstitions of the soil. And any thoughtful man who wanders there long, and is not baked up in a crust of pride which prevents free communion with his kind, will find a volume of interest in the quaint manners, language, and peculiar way of life of its inhabitants. ** But I must betake myself to my own experiences of a visit to the place.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Silverdale",27,37],["Morecambe",438,447],["Silverdale",1032,1042],["Silverdale",1591,1601],["England",1806,1813]],"geonouns":[["station",38,45],["ridges",126,132],["vale",148,152],["land",283,287],["dells",316,321],["hills",388,393],["shore",448,453],["pike",510,514],["tarn",563,567],["woods",611,616],["vales",621,626],["land",858,862],["foot",915,919],["sea",1003,1006],["passes",1241,1247],["sea",1357,1360],["woods",1461,1466],["hill",1677,1681],["woods",1698,1703],["land",1731,1735],["sands",1826,1831],["sea",1865,1868],["shores",1880,1886]],"pos_words":[["lush",327,331],["loves",522,527],["pleasant",640,648],["quiet",1052,1057],["cheery",1191,1197],["famous",1783,1789],["mighty",1819,1825],["thoughtful",1927,1937],["pride",2000,2005],["free",2021,2025],["quaint",2089,2095]],"neg_words":[["disappointed",84,96],["bleak",197,202],["rocky",249,254],["irregular",353,362],["lonely",556,562],["rocky",724,729],["stranger",1068,1076],["slowly",1178,1184],["babble",1198,1204],["lonely",1609,1615],["tramp",1632,1637],["wild",1693,1697],["rocky",1874,1879],["peculiar",2119,2127]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["westward",230,238],["there",263,268],["between",376,383],["there",806,811],["there",1087,1092],["there",1502,1507],["there",1954,1959]],"spa_preps":[["over",239,243],["down",426,430]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0146341463,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988635778},{"para_id":285,"paragraph":"Our northern spring, that fickle pet of the poet's song, is, sometimes, a season of much unsettled temper, that it is pleasanter to read of its\" delights\" by a comfortable fireside, or hear them sung of in a concert-room, than go in search of them outside; that is, if you happen to be asthmatical, or anything of that kind. *** Well; the particular spring of which I am speaking, opened cold and raw, with a keen east wind; and I went sneezing to the station, where I found several cold people walking about, on the day when I set off to see Silverdale for the first time.

It was almost like coming out of the tail of winter into summer in a three hours ride. *** There are two roads from the station into Silverdale. Sending part of my luggage forward by a lad, I took up the left hand, over the ridge which conceals the vale. This road is rather shorter than the other, being about a mile and a quarter to what may be called the village part of Silverdale. But the homesteads of Silverdale are so scattered, so dropped about in nooks and on knolls, almost out of sight of one another - as if each liked to have a good deal of green country to itself - that one can hardly say, with propriety, that there is a village there.

On each hand, wooded hills close the view; and in the far north-east behind me, the Cumberland mountains arise in tumultuous grandeur, tipped with sunshine. The sea is little more than a mile off, but not yet in sight. Yonder, the plumy top of Arnside Knott peeps over the long ridge of Middlebarrow; and, on the opposite side, rocky Trowbarrow, and, south of that, Wharton Crag, are the enclosing heights. The rugged portal of Silverdale is now down in the rear, and I see that the country is prettily feathered with woodlands, and the cultivated land very fertile. Every sight and sound is suggestive of quietness and rural life; and the sleepy joy which pervades the scene steals soothingly into the mind. Now and then, the westering sunbeam comes full in my face; and I turn aside to look a minute into the refreshing shade of a bye-lane, all carpeted with moist grass. It has a bowery, untrodden look, and seems to wind away under the embracing trees, to some retired spot of greenery\" where rural fays and fairies dwell.\" As I go along, a pass a solitary\" lane cow,\" belonging to some landless cottager. The poor man's cow never lifts her head to look, but goes on audibly cropping the short grass by the wayside. Over the hedges I get a glimpse, here and there, of sleeker kine browsing lazily in richer pastures; and, in yonder field, there is a young horse galloping round in frantic glee, and lashing his heels into the air, as if trying to break away from the tether of an imaginary cart. Now he tramps defiantly up to the hedge-side, and looks over at me. I flourish my stick, and he gives a loud snort, and gallops off again, wilder than before. Here is a broad field of newly-furrowed land, where birds are busy among the chocolate-coloured soil; and. by the green roadside, yonder, there is a rabbit, which hears my footsteps, and runs up the hedge into a plantation hard by. Now, I heard a dog barking. ** It is up at the corner of the lane, a-head, where smoke is rising from two low-built cottages under the trees. A donkey-cart emerges from the lane, loaded with hampers and bags of fish, - flooks and cockles, I guess. The brown old driver on the front of the cart chucks his head aside towards me as he passes, and says,\" Well; yaar comin!\"\" I'm coming, say I; and away goes the cart down the road; with the dog leaping up at the donkey's mouth, and barking, while the hills seem to toss the sound about upon the quiet scene. And yet, when I come to the corner of the lane, I hear the birds making a gleeful coil in the woods below, as if they were rehearsing a kind of\" Hallelujah Chorus\" of their own, to finish the day with. ** I pass a tasteful villa in a garden, with walks that look almost too trim for ordinary footing; and then the gables of a larger mansion appear above the trees, on the opposite side. This house is very pictu - resquely seated upon a smooth lawn, which slopes softly to the edge of a great limestone precipice. The rugged front of the rock is cushioned and festooned prettily in some places with its native greeneries; and at the foot of it, there is a beautiful little vale, called\" Levens Bottoms.\" The little vale runs away southward in a long woody glen, towards Warton Sands. Down in the green holm there are half a dozen or more cows grazing; and a man in his shirt sleeves is trimming a hedge. I am almost sure I hear the clip of his shears, it is such a quaint place. There is a little girl tripping along a field-path, on the opposite slope, with a can in her hand, as if fetching water from some well in the wood beyond. She is singing too; and the birds seem to mock her and make fun of her as she goes heedlessly on. All else is still in the little dell.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Silverdale",43,53],["Cumberland",154,164],["Arnside",314,321],["Crag",444,448],["Silverdale",498,508],["Levens",3204,3210],["Warton",3287,3293]],"geonouns":[["hills",91,96],["mountains",165,174],["sea",231,234],["top",307,310],["ridge",348,353],["country",553,560],["land",618,622],["lane",907,911],["trees",1020,1025],["pass",1115,1119],["lane",1132,1136],["head",1215,1219],["field",1406,1411],["field",1745,1750],["land",1769,1773],["lane",2022,2026],["head",2030,2034],["cottages",2077,2085],["trees",2096,2101],["lane",2134,2138],["head",2266,2270],["passes",2294,2300],["road",2384,2388],["mouth",2430,2435],["hills",2460,2465],["lane",2559,2563],["woods",2611,2616],["pass",2724,2728],["mansion",2850,2857],["trees",2875,2880],["house",2909,2914],["lawn",2961,2965],["slopes",2973,2979],["edge",2994,2998],["precipice",3020,3029],["rock",3055,3059],["foot",3150,3154],["vale",3190,3194],["vale",3232,3236],["glen",3273,3277],["field",3536,3541],["path",3542,3546],["slope",3564,3569],["water",3610,3615],["wood",3638,3642],["dell",3781,3785]],"pos_words":[["grandeur",195,203],["prettily",564,572],["fertile",628,635],["joy",717,720],["soothingly",753,763],["refreshing",881,891],["audibly",1241,1248],["richer",1374,1380],["glee",1463,1467],["flourish",1640,1648],["quiet",2504,2509],["gleeful",2591,2598],["smooth",2954,2960],["great",3004,3009],["prettily",3087,3095],["beautiful",3173,3182],["quaint",3482,3488],["well",3626,3630],["fun",3711,3714]],"neg_words":[["tumultuous",184,194],["rocky",398,403],["steals",746,752],["poor",1184,1188],["frantic",1455,1462],["break",1521,1526],["imaginary",1554,1563],["defiantly",1584,1593],["hedge",1604,1609],["loud",1674,1678],["hedge",1928,1933],["hard",1952,1956],["smoke",2042,2047],["hedge",3414,3419],["mock",3693,3697]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",2705,2712]],"times":[["a minute",863,871]],"distances":[["more than a mile",245,261]],"loc_advs":[["aside",849,854],["here",1323,1327],["there",1332,1337],["there",1413,1418],["there",1867,1872],["aside",2271,2276],["away",2356,2360],["below",2617,2622],["above",2865,2870],["opposite",2889,2897],["there",3162,3167],["southward",3247,3256],["there",3324,3329],["opposite",3555,3563]],"spa_preps":[["into",54,58],["close",97,102],["behind",139,145],["over",334,338],["opposite",383,391],["down",516,520],["into",764,768],["into",872,876],["away",995,999],["under",1000,1005],["along",1106,1111],["round",1446,1451],["into",1491,1495],["away",1527,1531],["over",1626,1630],["among",1796,1801],["into",1934,1938],["under",2086,2091],["down",2375,2379],["about",2489,2494],["away",3242,3246],["along",3528,3533],["beyond",3643,3649]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0110497238,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9979439378},{"para_id":288,"paragraph":"When I got to the top of the next knoll, Morecambe Bay was at the foot of the slope before me.

It is a large, plain, white-washed building upon high ground, looking over a few sloping fields, right out to sea. I went through a small enclosure, half garden half lawn, up to a kind of private door at the end. I knocked, and it was opened by a tall, mild-faced old woman, dressed in black. She wore an old-fashioned white cap, with a broad black ribbon running over the head of it; and her clean apron was of blue lin check. \" Is this Mr. Fawcett's house?\" said I.\" Yes.\" \" I sent some luggage up just now.\" \" Oh, is it you sir? come in. do.

When tea was over at the inn, I sat down to smoke and read by a window looking upon the lawn; but it was no use; I could n't rest until I had been down to the shore; so I put my book aside and set off. ** It was a fine evening! The sunset was burning out grandly upon the woods and knolls of Silverdale. When I came to the beach, it would be about the time of low water; and the shining pools and stripes left by the tide, looked like sentinels guarding the desert till the waves' return. On this great level, the sea had retired so far that I could hardly discern the white line of the surge; but there came through the quiet air dying murmurs of that voice whose softest tones are suggestive of majesty and mystery; and even from the lonely sands there seemed to arise a faint hum of weird sea-music. *** I hovered about the shore, charmed with this remarkable scene. *** With the exception of Ulverstone, almost all the chief towns and villages of Morecambe Bay were in view, from Peel Castle round to Fleetwood. Out towards Lancaster the water was full in sight, bright and smooth as a mirror, and the green shores of the Lune estuary stood clear on the water-line, like floating islands becalmed in a sea of silver. *** Along the stony slope of the shore there lay an irregular line of rubbish, composed of shrivelled sea-weed, fragments of wood, broken pots, bottles, old torn sapless shoes, steeped and washed into a kind of frosted brown by the action of the briny sea; rags, bits of rope, and such like things, indicative of life on the ocean. This rubbish had been thrown up by a high tide some days previous, and had lain since then, bleaching and crisping in the sun, turned over here and there by people who roam and root about the high-water line, as soon as the tide begins to turn, in the hope of finding\" something rich and strange.\" Upon the same slope there is a solitary cottage called,\" The Bath House.\" I understand that this cottage has been sometimes lashed and flooded by the stormy waters. Near to it there lies a broken mizen-mast, twenty yards long, and seven feet girth. It has been dragged up out of the water's reach. A few yards off that, there is a large pine log; and, on the rocks of the south, a battered red boat lies bottom upwards, waiting for its owners, now, perhaps, rolling cold upon the restless ocean's bed. ** Crossing the narrow channels, and patches of moist verdure, nearest the shore, I walk a little seaward, upon the track made by fish-carts going down to the nets. Towards the water I see straggling figures; and here and there a lone fisherman is sauntering shoreward, with his long shadow on the sands before him. Far away out, the smoke of a steamer trails through the air, and nearer, three or four small white sails are gliding over the water, lit by the setting sun. *** Now, from the northward, a great herd of cattle moves slowly over the solemn waste, on their way, from Kent's bank to Wharton shore, a distance of about six miles, I think. From head to hoof they shew distinctly between me and the setting sun, as their restless legs play quaintly onward in intermingling motions; and every whisk of their tails makes a clear though evanescent mark in the air. The lowings of the herd, the barkings of the dogs, and the shouts of the drivers hurrying their cattle over the silent sands, sounds strangely impressive. It brings to mind the many tales of adventure and fatal disaster connected with the ground they are treading. Even whilst I am writing, I remember that, about a fortnight after I had seen that herd of cattle cross, three of the finest young men in Silverdale were overtaken by the tide about the same spot and drowned there, even in sight of their friends on shore","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Silverdale",48,58],["Silverdale",352,362],["Ulverstone",956,966],["Morecambe Bay",1011,1024],["Peel",1044,1048],["Castle",1049,1055],["Lancaster",1088,1097],["Lune",1186,1190],["Kent",2993,2997],["Silverdale",3687,3697]],"geonouns":[["inn",85,88],["lawn",148,152],["shore",219,224],["woods",332,337],["beach",383,388],["water",424,429],["sea",574,577],["line",635,639],["sands",803,808],["sea",852,855],["shore",887,892],["towns",989,994],["villages",999,1007],["water",1102,1107],["shores",1172,1178],["estuary",1191,1198],["water",1218,1223],["line",1224,1228],["islands",1244,1251],["sea",1266,1269],["slope",1301,1306],["shore",1314,1319],["line",1343,1347],["sea",1383,1386],["wood",1406,1410],["sea",1533,1536],["water",1810,1815],["line",1816,1820],["slope",1925,1930],["cottage",1951,1958],["cottage",2008,2015],["waters",2068,2074],["water",2194,2199],["rocks",2270,2275],["boat",2305,2309],["bed",2408,2411],["channels",2436,2444],["shore",2488,2493],["track",2529,2534],["water",2590,2595],["sands",2711,2716],["steamer",2758,2765],["water",2855,2860],["bank",3000,3004],["shore",3016,3021],["head",3068,3072],["sands",3403,3408],["ground",3523,3529],["shore",3798,3803]],"pos_words":[["like",490,494],["great",557,562],["quiet",681,686],["majesty",757,764],["remarkable",912,922],["bright",1127,1133],["smooth",1138,1144],["clear",1205,1210],["like",1230,1234],["like",1567,1571],["rich",1892,1896],["great",2917,2922],["clear",3243,3248],["silent",3396,3402],["impressive",3427,3437],["finest",3667,3673],["overtaken",3703,3712]],"neg_words":[["smoke",104,109],["burning",303,310],["desert",518,524],["dying",691,696],["mystery",769,776],["lonely",796,802],["faint",833,838],["hum",839,842],["weird",846,851],["irregular",1333,1342],["rubbish",1351,1358],["weed",1387,1391],["broken",1412,1418],["rubbish",1618,1625],["strange",1901,1908],["stormy",2061,2067],["lies",2093,2097],["broken",2100,2106],["dragged",2172,2179],["battered",2292,2300],["lies",2310,2314],["cold",2377,2381],["restless",2391,2399],["lone",2643,2647],["smoke",2747,2752],["slowly",2944,2950],["solemn",2960,2966],["waste",2967,2972],["restless",3143,3151],["strangely",3417,3426],["fatal",3489,3494],["disaster",3495,3503]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",272,278],["some days previous",1660,1678],["about a",3592,3599]],"times":[["evening",37,44],["evening",279,286]],"distances":[["seven feet",2142,2152],["about six miles",3037,3052]],"loc_advs":[["aside",243,248],["left",465,469],["there",658,663],["there",809,814],["there",1320,1325],["here",1752,1756],["there",1761,1766],["there",1931,1936],["there",2087,2092],["there",2231,2236],["upwards",2322,2329],["here",2626,2630],["there",2635,2640],["northward",2904,2913],["there",3757,3762]],"spa_preps":[["over",73,77],["down",96,100],["down",207,211],["out",311,314],["about",402,407],["through",669,676],["about",877,882],["round",1056,1061],["into",1477,1481],["over",1747,1751],["about",1795,1800],["out",2183,2186],["down",2560,2564],["away",2733,2737],["out",2738,2741],["through",2773,2780],["over",2846,2850],["over",2951,2955],["between",3102,3109],["over",3387,3391],["about",3725,3730]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0406504065,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974403381},{"para_id":293,"paragraph":"As I came slowly up from the beach with my yielding senses steeped in the pensive splendour of the scene, I halted a minute to look at a pleasant dwelling, which stands on a green shelf of land, looking over the rocks, out upon the sands. The windows were open, as if the rooms were being aired for some coming occupant. I asked a bare-legged fisher lad, who came paddling up from the sea, whose house that was. \" It's Mester Tysoe's,\" said he; and then he stopped and stared, as if saying to himself,\" Well, now; if he wants somewhere to stop at aa can soon tell him of a place.\" But his heart failed him, and he went quietly on, up the white road; and I followed very slowly, for the scene was far too sweet to be hurried by unheeded. ** In a bosky dingle, nearly opposite the house, a solitary throstle was chanting loud and clear upon a slender, lazy-swinging bough, like a blithe lad playing at rantipole, or the jolly clerk of Copmanhurst carousing in his lonely woodland cell. Farther up, among the woods and gardens, the leaves were all a-tremble with wild music. ** The white road is irregularly bordered with dusty, half - trodden grass, strewn, here with bits of stone, and there, with a few cockle shells, thrown out from a wayside cottage. On the right hand, a tuft of nettles and a low thorn bush are clustered close to the limestone wall of a small orchard, over which spreading boughs of thick-blossomed apple-trees hang in a rich gush, as if there was no room for any more of them inside. On the left hand, where the grass border is broader, a few dusty daisies - those cottage children of the flower-world - peep out upon the green roadside; their simple beauty shining prettily through the smirching veil of their birthplace. Close by the common trod, they smile away their tiny life, looking aloft with sunny eye, unenvious of the garden favourites on the other side of the wall. The contented elves do not even seem to know that they are dusty. They can wait till kind nature sends her next shower,*** In this grove of speary firs, the birds are twittering, and pruning their wings, upon the branches nearest the road, and almost within reach of me. They look at the lounging traveller, out of those little wondering jewels of theirs. One of them gushes forth a silvery rolade, and hops to the next twig, which swings up and down, as if dancing a welcome to its pretty comrade. The bird gives another look at me out of the corner of his eye, and then carols away again in full-throttled glee, - not much afraid. ** Twilight is stealing on! The fading day is suffused with the last glory of the sunken sun; and the commonest objects are robing in a beauty which seems to have more of heaven than earth in it. The rude realities of noon are melting into a strange loveliness at the touch of the power, whose gauzy fringe of dreams trails on the golden skirts of the day; and all things seem to be stilling down to a noiseless thrill of adoration. ** It is the hour when forlorn wanderers, peeping in at cottage doors, hear mothers croodling soft lullabys to their drowsy babes, and feel very sad as thoughts of home and childhood steal into their hearts!** Oh, meek hour of shadowy beauty! what strange thoughts, what smouldering tendernesses, what pensive ecstasy thou hast power to waken!* Twilight is stealing on!* It is easier now to distinguish the different songs of birds which have lingered behind the rest, to sing the day out. And those strange undersounds, which, even in the loneliest dell, seem to sleep when the sun is aloft, now grow upon the ear, and drowse the spirit with a mystic spell. It seems as if the evening air was peopled with a choir of viewless minstrels, whose business was to take up the hymn of nature, when daylight lays his louder music by. *** I stopped in my walk, and leaned upon a field wall, to look around me. The kine are lowing aloud in this pasture, as if asking whether it was n't time to be called home. In a distant farmyard a dog barks; and the song of a girl makes the listening ear of a little valley tingle with pleasure. * Now, a wild bee goes bazooning by me, pleased with the spoil he is carrying home from the flowers of Silverdale; and, from yon brown upland, where the ploughman's loosened horses are wending slowly from the furrowed field, a clear jingle of chains comes through the still air. ** Now the wind gives a drowsy sough through the vale - like a man turning over in his sleep - and then dies away into silence again. In the east, the crescent moon is gliding up the blue heavens to take her night-watch over the slumbering world. The tree-tops are all still; and the birds are dropping off for the night in their green chambers. But in this deepening stillness I hear the surgy voice of ocean growing louder on the ear; and now I see that the sands I left so lately are fast silvering over the rising tide. The shores of Morecambe are fading away, and the round top of Arnside Knott grows dim. And yet I will linger a little while. ** Here comes a brown-faced youth round the corner of the road, with a mash-tub in his arms. He is taking short steps; I suppose, because the tub is heavy and perhaps a little hot. He does n't notice me, however, but goes whistling into the stable-yard close by, and I see no more of him. * Now a coatless mason comes along, under the trees, on the cross-road. He has a dinner basket on his arm, and a tin can with a wire handle in his hand. A little ruddy girl, with a doll clipt in her arms, is holding on by his shirt sleeve, and chattering to him in silvery trebles, as she now lilts a bit, now trots on by his side. ** There is a lull again for a few minutes. ** Anon, a healthy-looking lad comes capering up. He is dressed in a blue check smock and patched fustian trousers; and he is kicking up the dust on the road, and indulging in frantic chuckles of independent glee, as if he did n't like to see everything looking so still, and was determined that quaintness should not have it all its own way. He sees me looking at him; but he evidently does n't care a straw for that. He has something like a clean towel under his arm; and I should n't wonder if his mother has been sending him somewhere with clothes home from the wash, and he is coming back with the money. He looks at me critically for a moment or so, and - it is all over. I am disposed of at once to the satisfaction of his unsophisticated mind, and away he goes again, singing and knocking his heels together in a kind of sidelong dance, utterly at variance with all known rules of human motion and he is out of sight in a minute.

This enclosure is made up of a grove, a plot of kitchen garden, and, between the two, a little flower-bordered lawn, commanding as fine a view to seaward as can be had anywhere in the dale. A small green gate, half hidden by rose trees, and half overhung by a laburnum tree - if I remember right - open from the lawn upon sloping fields, which divide the house from the sands. From this gate, a bye-path leads to a picturesque wooded nook of the shore, called\" Cove.\" It is one of the quietest and prettiest short walks in Silverdale. \" Cove\" is said to be haunted by a troubled spirit - a boggart or\" dobbie,\" as they call it there. The rocks about\" Cove\" are picturesque in form and colour; and there are caves from whence, Silverdale people ill tell you, fairies come forth on moonlight nights to dance upon the sands. It is a pleasant spot; and you may come back from it by the shore, or wander thence, on a good road, up the whole length of the vale: or, at a short distance up that road, strike off at the left hand over Middlebarrow, and so down to see Arnside vale and its ancient tower.

I saw the cart upset; and I says' Eh! Mr. Middleton's killed.' But I'm very glad youere no worse.\" \" Well, so I am, too,\" replied he. \" Ye see, this is how it was.

I had been there about an hour when the landlord came to say that his son was setting of with the cart for water to the\" Dripping Well,\" in Leven's Bottom, and when he came back he would go with me to the lake on Silverdale Moss. ** Now, a country well is always an interesting sight, so I bethought me that I would go down with the cart for water. I found Stephen in the inn yard yoking old\" Betsy\" to the cart, in which were two great tubs. In a few minutes we passed the little post-office, and leaving the sea on the right, we went a short distance along the road which leads southward up to Lindeth Tower. We then turned off on the left up a rocky bye-road, and then down into a lonely holme, in the lowest part of which the bye-way brought us to the\" Dripping Well.\" It is an ancient well, situate at the foot of a long breast of picturesque limestone rock, which runs out southward towards the sands. This breast of rock is itself a beautiful sight, and its beauty is enhanced by a scattered overgrowth, consisting of patches of grass, savins, brambles, thorns, hazels, wild plum trees, stunted yews, ferns, wild tansy, blue bells, primroses, and daisies. The grassy hollow near the well is a great place for wood-cocks, as Stephen said,\" because of the springs.\" The well is a long, narrow trough of joined stones, sunken in a shady place at the foot of the rocks. It is fed by little rills and drippings from the hill side, hence its name\" The Dripping Well.\" The lower part of the rocks, just over the well, is richly cushioned and freaked with moss. In one pretty crevice, where the moss is of a lighter, brighter green than elsewhere, a large fresh leaf of ivy had been doubled and placed so as to form a green spout, over which the prettiest rindle of water came trickling into daylight, and then falling into the limpid well below, played a tiny melody - so delicate that one had to bend down to hear it well - such melody as makes the\" little folk\" who love the moonlight itch to fall a-dancing. The old well is rudely enclosed on the outer side by low limestone walls, with a small opening left in the centre through which water fetchers go in and out, resting their vessels on the mossy walls. The inside of the narrow enclosure is paved with blue boulders, worn with long footing, and at one end it is shaded by thorns and wild rose trees, beneath which a bush of green nettles clusters, and a few sprigs of delicate fern peep out from a most nook thereabouts. ** Stephen filled his big tubs and we started homeward. One tub had a wooden lid on, the other was only covered with a rough cloth to keep in the water; but, in spite of this, it flung over in great splashes as the cart jolted up to Lindeth tower, the tree shadows lay sharp-cut upon the sunny road. Here, three fat ducks waddled across lazily from one green border to the other, quacking; there, a white calf has pushed his innocent face through the bars of a gate, and was bleating forth his young troubles to the heedless world; and, right before us, came slowly up a dusty old sand-cart, drawn by a dusty little blind horse, and driven by a dusty lad. The lazy sand-cart went noiselessly by, like a man walking in his stocking-feet. There was now no human being in sight till we came to where three roads met, and the garden walls of a mansion were overhung with blossom. There was a sound of children's voices in the garden; and, as we went by, a bevy of young beauties sallied forth for a walk, accompanied by a frisking, noisy, short-legged terrier, whose two eyes shone through their little night of gray hair, like glow-worms in the dark upon a bushy hedge-bank burning. * When we got to the inn it was drawing near to noon, and, whilst Stephen got the water-tubs out of the cart, and stabled\" Betsy,\" I sat down to talk with Old Joe, the postman from Lancaster, who calls there to rest and get his dinner before returning home again. He was telling about going with letters to the mansion of some old gentleman who was deaf. The gentleman was walking about the lawn when, seeing Joe come up, all travel-soiled and strange, he called out,\" Who are you?\" \" Postman, sir!\"\" Be off, you vagabond; we've nothing for you!\"\" Postman, sir!\" cried Joe, still speeding on. \" Be off, I tell you! What d' ye want?\" \" Postman sir!\"\" Do n't come near me, you rascal!\" continued the deaf old gentleman;\" leave the grounds immediately, or I'll set the dogs on you!\"\" Postman, sir!\" said Joe, once more, pulling out the letters and handing them to the irascible gentleman; who, seeing his mistake, said,\" O dear, yes, yes! I was quite wrong. What, you'll not think anything about it. I'm an old man, and very deaf, and - here, here, here; you was doing your duty. Right, right; very right.\"** In a few minutes Stephen came in from the stable, and we prepared for our walk to the lake.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Leven",355,360],["Silverdale",428,438],["Lancaster",4055,4064]],"geonouns":[["table",34,39],["seat",110,114],["lawn",122,126],["shores",196,202],["bay",210,213],["water",322,327],["lake",420,424],["country",455,462],["water",557,562],["inn",587,590],["post",696,700],["sea",725,728],["road",778,782],["road",872,876],["foot",1026,1030],["rock",1073,1077],["sands",1116,1121],["rock",1138,1142],["trees",1302,1307],["hollow",1389,1395],["wood",1431,1435],["stones",1530,1536],["foot",1569,1573],["rocks",1581,1586],["hill",1637,1641],["rocks",1706,1711],["water",1980,1985],["walls",2293,2298],["water",2354,2359],["walls",2419,2424],["trees",2566,2571],["nook",2676,2680],["water",2840,2845],["tower",2935,2940],["tree",2946,2950],["road",2988,2992],["gate",3155,3159],["feet",3425,3429],["roads",3497,3502],["walls",3523,3528],["mansion",3534,3541],["bank",3860,3864],["inn",3895,3898],["water",3956,3961],["mansion",4185,4192],["lawn",4265,4269],["grounds",4603,4610],["lake",5066,5070]],"pos_words":[["well",463,467],["interesting",481,492],["great",646,651],["right",736,741],["leads",789,794],["well",1005,1009],["picturesque",1051,1062],["beautiful",1155,1164],["beauty",1180,1186],["enhanced",1190,1198],["well",1405,1409],["great",1415,1420],["well",1490,1494],["well",1727,1731],["richly",1736,1742],["pretty",1783,1789],["lighter",1822,1829],["brighter",1831,1839],["fresh",1870,1875],["well",2049,2053],["delicate",2087,2095],["well",2133,2137],["love",2183,2187],["well",2234,2238],["delicate",2641,2649],["great",2887,2892],["sharp",2963,2968],["right",3231,3236],["like",3390,3394],["blossom",3561,3568],["like",3813,3817],["glow",3818,3822],["right",4958,4963],["right",4970,4975],["stable",5022,5028]],"neg_words":[["rocky",862,867],["lonely",899,905],["wild",1292,1296],["stunted",1309,1316],["wild",1330,1334],["sunken",1538,1544],["shady",1550,1555],["falling",2025,2032],["itch",2202,2206],["fall",2210,2214],["worn",2490,2494],["wild",2556,2560],["rough",2813,2818],["spite",2855,2860],["fat",3006,3009],["troubles",3194,3202],["heedless",3210,3218],["slowly",3253,3259],["dusty",3265,3270],["dusty",3297,3302],["blind",3310,3315],["dusty",3339,3344],["lazy",3354,3358],["noisy",3722,3727],["dark",3836,3840],["hedge",3854,3859],["burning",3865,3872],["deaf",4223,4227],["strange",4318,4325],["rascal",4549,4555],["deaf",4572,4576],["irascible",4739,4748],["mistake",4776,4783],["wrong",4822,4827],["deaf",4896,4900]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",331,335],["the\"",967,971],["the\"",2161,2165]],"times":[["about an hour",232,245],["a few minutes",661,674],["their little night",3780,3798],["noon",3922,3926],["a few minutes",4983,4996]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",226,231],["southward",795,804],["left",852,856],["southward",1094,1103],["elsewhere",1851,1860],["left",2321,2325],["homeward",2740,2748],["across",3024,3030],["there",3084,3089],["there",4076,4081],["home",4126,4130],["here",4908,4912],["here",4914,4918],["here",4920,4924]],"spa_preps":[["out",82,85],["down",140,144],["about",153,158],["out",167,170],["down",534,538],["along",768,773],["down",887,891],["into",892,896],["out",1090,1093],["near",1396,1400],["over",1718,1722],["over",1945,1949],["into",2001,2005],["into",2033,2037],["below",2054,2059],["down",2117,2121],["through",2340,2347],["out",2379,2382],["inside",2430,2436],["beneath",2573,2580],["out",2660,2663],["over",2879,2883],["through",3133,3140],["through",3772,3779],["near",3914,3918],["out",3967,3970],["down",4011,4015],["about",4153,4158],["about",4255,4260],["out",4337,4340],["near",4536,4540],["out",4699,4702],["about",4861,4866]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.964435935},{"para_id":379,"paragraph":"The tarns of Silverdale are known there by the names of Great and Little Hawes Water. They are joined by a very small channel. The lesser is a gloomy-looking pond, surrounded by a tall, thick hedge of thorns, hollies, and wild rose-trees, with a great growth of brambles. The ground immediately about it is swampy. I remember how I had to wade to reach the hedge; and then how I scratched my hands a little, and tore my coat a good deal in trying to get a peep at the stirless witch-pool. The larger tarn is something more than a mile around, and is quite open to view. I had often heard of this tarn before, on account of some peculiarities belonging thereto. The nearest end of that water is about a mile and a half from the inn. It is situate in a lone nook at the eastern extremity of the vale, and at the head of a level tract of land, newly won from the waste, called\" Silverdale Moss.\" It lies between the hills of Middlebarrow; and, except one little shooting-box upon its northern shore, and an old farm-house on the same side, I believe it is out of sight of any dwelling of man. Its waters are of great depth, and it abounds in pike. It is said to be strangely moved by the tides of the sea. Near its eastern shore there are traces of a Roman road; and I am told that such traces are clearer upon the hill called Trowbarrow, hard by on the south. A short distance from the water's edge there is good bye-road nearly all round, but whoever walks close upon its sedgy marge must mind his footing well, or he may sink farther than he likes into a kind of limy paste on one side of the tarn, and on the other into the peaty bog. On its southern-eastern shore there is a bed of beautiful little snow-white shells, as delicate as frozen moonlight. There is a tradition, too, about the big snig of Silverdale tarn. The lake is said to have been haunted by a great eel, or snake or some kind. Near the old farm-house, upon the upland, north of the water, a curious rock stands alone on the summit of a pastoral knoll. The rock is called the\" Buck Stone.\" Seen from the road it bears some rude like - ness to an immense human head, and at a lower part is worn away in a smooth neck-like hollow. Tradition says that the great eel of Silverdale tarn used to come up from the water, and coil itself round this lower part of the rock, thus wearing away the hollow place in the stone. Here, coiled round, it used to lurk until some careless sheep came within reach, when it would dart forth, and drag its victim down to the water, to devour it there. Thus runs the story in its simplest form, though I have heard different versions of it. I have heard different accounts of the size of this eel, too; but there was a certain old Silverdale wag, called Thomas Hoggatt, who used to say that when it was killed at last, there was nearly a pack of wool found in the hollow of one of its teeth. Of course, that's a lie; but there are folk in Silverdale who would have believed it if it had been ten times as big.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Silverdale",13,23],["Hawes Water",73,84],["Silverdale",875,885],["Silverdale",1802,1812],["Silverdale",2234,2244],["Silverdale",2726,2736],["Silverdale",2934,2944]],"geonouns":[["channel",118,125],["trees",232,237],["ground",276,282],["tarn",500,504],["tarn",596,600],["water",685,690],["inn",727,730],["nook",756,760],["vale",793,797],["head",810,814],["land",835,839],["hills",913,918],["shore",990,995],["farm",1008,1012],["house",1013,1018],["waters",1094,1100],["pike",1139,1143],["sea",1198,1201],["shore",1220,1225],["road",1254,1258],["hill",1312,1316],["water",1384,1389],["edge",1392,1396],["road",1415,1419],["tarn",1593,1597],["bog",1631,1634],["shore",1660,1665],["bed",1677,1680],["tarn",1813,1817],["lake",1823,1827],["farm",1909,1913],["house",1914,1919],["water",1951,1956],["rock",1968,1972],["summit",1993,1999],["rock",2025,2029],["road",2072,2076],["head",2128,2132],["tarn",2245,2249],["water",2275,2280],["rock",2327,2331],["stone",2375,2380],["water",2521,2526],["hollow",2859,2865]],"pos_words":[["great",246,251],["good",427,431],["won",847,850],["great",1108,1113],["abounds",1128,1135],["clearer",1295,1302],["good",1406,1410],["well",1505,1509],["likes",1542,1547],["beautiful",1684,1693],["delicate",1723,1731],["great",1862,1867],["like",2096,2100],["immense",2114,2121],["smooth",2172,2178],["like",2184,2188],["great",2221,2226],["simplest",2575,2583]],"neg_words":[["gloomy",143,149],["hedge",192,197],["wild",222,226],["hedge",357,362],["scratched",379,388],["lone",751,755],["waste",860,865],["lies",896,900],["strangely",1162,1171],["hard",1336,1340],["sink",1521,1525],["frozen",1735,1741],["rude",2091,2095],["worn",2157,2161],["hollow",2189,2195],["hollow",2355,2361],["lurk",2413,2417],["careless",2429,2437],["drag",2493,2497],["killed",2798,2804],["lie",2907,2910]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",2040,2044]],"times":[],"distances":[["more than a mile",518,534],["about a mile and a half",694,717]],"loc_advs":[["there",34,39],["there",1226,1231],["there",1397,1402],["there",1666,1671],["there",2541,2546],["there",2702,2707],["there",2814,2819],["there",2916,2921]],"spa_preps":[["about",295,300],["around",535,541],["between",901,908],["out",1053,1056],["round",1431,1436],["close",1456,1461],["into",1548,1552],["into",1616,1620],["about",1780,1785],["away",2162,2166],["round",2298,2303],["away",2346,2350],["round",2395,2400],["within",2449,2455],["down",2509,2513]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0103092784,"vader_sentiment":0.79,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9757650495},{"para_id":380,"paragraph":"It was high noon when we set out for Silverdale Tarn. The sun glared upon the white road in a way that was painful to the eye. High up on the steep of Middlebarrow, and right in front of us, a large new mansion stands on a bold perch, among sloping gardens, with a park stretching away east, along the hill side. Our way lies by the lower edge of that park. There are not more than half a dozen houses on the road. First we pass the blacksmith's. The smith door is open, but he must be gone to dinner, for all is still. A little further on the other side of the road, we come to the cottage of old Halliday, the shoemaker, better known as\" Aald Sabbath,\" and said to be the best workman in Silverdale for strong work. He sits working and singing, with the door open, in a little white shed adjoining his cottage. The mild-faced young man on the bench next to him is his son, the fleetest footracer in all Silverdale. From the road, in front of\" Aald Sabbth's\" shop, a charming cluster of white cottages may be seen, nestling in a green corner, at the foot of Middlebarrow. The road winds around eastward, and, in ten minutes more we come to the modest chapel of Silverdale, with its little school-house, at the edge of the parl. After that we pass a doleful-looking house, which I should have thought deserted but for seeing a child at play near the door. Half a mile further on, the road gives a sharp turn, as we come to two old-fashioned cottages, of very rude build. I think they must have been white-washed some time, but that is doubtful. Opposite these cottages, old Jonathan Jackson is leaning over his pig-cote wall, watching a young litter at their meat. At the bottom of the slope, just beyond this, we enter the level tract called Silverdale Moss, and leave the homes of man behind. As we went along the rough cart road, my companion said,\" Now, look out for vipers. Such weather as this they come out of the woods, and lie coiled up, basking in the sun, on places like that,\" pointing to a bank of parched grass by the road side. We looked about as we went on. In a few minutes there was a low rustle in a bush close to the left hand wall. My companion turned quickly, and called out,\" That's one, I believe!\" I began to beat the bush with my stick; but, he said,\" Nay, it'll have got away into the wall, now. Come on; we shall have a chance of seeing one in Middlebarrow Wood. It's a liklier place than this.\" We went on; but I could n't help looking cautiously about, for I did n't like the idea of setting my foot on a sleeping viper. The day was hot as if it had been midsummer, and the glaring limestone road so pained my sight, that I was glad when my companion turned aside into a wheat field belonging to his father. Here, in the shade of the hedge, we sat down upon a harrow, to smoke and look about us. It was the time\" when wheat is green, and hawthorn buds appear,\" and the field we sat in reminded me of one of Lynell's pictures. The dark brown soil, all bespeared with new sprung wheat, was beautiful and relieving to the eye. The rippling tarn was all in view, and from its blue waters a refreshing coolness came now and then, as the lazy wind stole by, stirring the willows and hawthorn leaves about us with a sleepy rustle. On the opposite side, green pastures swelled gracefully up to where an old farm-house stood, half shaded by trees. From the woods of Trowbarrow, behind us, the cuckoo's note floated loud and clear over the moss. Upon the furrowed field, the wailing, white-breasted plover, and the trilling\" whincheck\" sang and wandered. Up among the trees, on the nearest hill side, the throstle gushed forth in luscious fits his jovial lay; whilst, poised aloft on sunlit wing, the lark rained down his lyric shower upon the golden air. This moss is a famous place for wild birds. We could not tell the names of the birds we saw and heard that day.

They may be gathered in handfulls; but it is better to scoop them up with a spoon, they are so fragile. We took a shortcut over the furrows to the water side. Here, the footing was so soft and uncertain, that we had to pick our way carefully, turning back, and going round about, to get to where the shells lay like patches of snow upon the bank beyond. A few minutes sufficed to fill our basket with the shells. There was a solitary pike fisher on the opposite side of the water; and as we pricked along the soft bank to get to the eastern shore, a silvery laugh came from the road upon the side of the northward hill, where two young ladies had been watching our awkward motions as we sank into the limy paste, first with one foot and then the other. The line of the Roman road lies along the eastern end of the tarn. This is the extreme nook of the vale. The limestone rocks looked very beautiful amongst the surrounding green. There was a great growth of wild flowers, chiefly pansies, bluebells and primroses. We wandered in this wild nook nearly two hours. Rabbits were running about everywhere; and we saw several squirrels in the trees. The woods of Silverdale abound in nuts; and the reader may find in Peel Park museum in Salford, a curious pair of primitive nut-crackers, known as Silverdale nut-crackers. They were given to that museum by the late Mr. Brotherton, M.P., who was very fond of Silverdale. I brought two pairs of them away with me. * We returned on a better road, along the wooded side of Middlebarrow. This was a pleasant diversion of the walk, and from this elevation we could see the configuration of the vale better than before. The road brought us out upon the sands, at the rocky corner called\" Cove,\" from whence we came homeward by the shore, and up through the village. As we came along the sands there came, now and then, a sound like the boom of a distant cannon. I asked what the sound meant, and my companion said,\" They were blasting rock on Meathorp Fell.\" The tide was gliding gracefully up again into the creases and fantastic indentations of the thirsty sands; and the evening train was trailing its snow-plume in the wind along the shore of Cartmel. * When we got to the inn, the old currier was there again - clothed in his right mind. The old man was now very shy, and had very little to say for some time, except that he hoped he had not said nor done anything offensive to anybody the night before. After we had reassured him a little, he became more talkative, and I learnt many interesting things from him relative to old Silverdale customs, such as\" Sand Leadings,\" Boon Ploughs,\" and\" Hen Silvers.\" The landlord's son told me of a cave called\" Harry Hest's Hole,\" on Wharton Crag, connected, by tradition, with the first scotch rebellion. Later in the evening an old gardener, called\" Strawberry John,\" came in, and entertained us with stories of the\" dobbies\" of Silverdale shore, -\" Scout Dobbie,\"\" Cove Dobbie,\" and\" The Sand Dobbie.\" Scout dobbie is a headless woman, who haunts Jacks' Scout and the cave below that, called\" Cow Mouth,\" in a rocky corner of the shore, south of Lindeth tower. \" You see, sir,\" said the humorous old currier;\" these dobbies have each their own beat marked out, like so many policemen.\" \" Strawberry John,\" however, evi - dently believed in many of the wild tales he told about these things; but the old currier said that, for his own part, he thought the weather last back-end had been very hard for dobbies, and he was afraid that some of them had not got over it. ** After this, I spent several days very pleasantly in Silverdale; and I do not care how soon I see the place again.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[["Silverdale",287,297],["Silverdale",1600,1610],["Peel",1654,1658],["Park",1659,1663],["Silverdale",1734,1744],["Silverdale",1845,1855],["Cove",2168,2172],["Cartmel",2627,2634],["Silverdale",3014,3024],["Crag",3169,3173],["Silverdale",3358,3368],["Cove",3395,3399],["Silverdale",4051,4061]],"geonouns":[["farm",120,124],["tarn",298,302],["beds",381,385],["shore",423,428],["tarn",436,440],["water",589,594],["bank",783,787],["pike",876,880],["water",916,921],["bank",956,960],["shore",983,988],["road",1020,1024],["hill",1056,1060],["line",1199,1203],["road",1217,1221],["tarn",1256,1260],["nook",1282,1286],["vale",1294,1298],["rocks",1314,1319],["nook",1482,1486],["trees",1580,1585],["woods",1591,1596],["road",1925,1929],["vale",2075,2079],["road",2104,2108],["sands",2133,2138],["shore",2211,2216],["village",2237,2244],["sands",2267,2272],["rock",2415,2419],["sands",2539,2544],["train",2562,2567],["shore",2618,2623],["inn",2657,2660],["shore",3369,3374],["shore",3560,3565],["tower",3584,3589]],"pos_words":[["better",487,493],["soft",626,630],["like",753,757],["sufficed",810,818],["soft",951,955],["beautiful",1332,1341],["great",1385,1390],["abound",1611,1617],["fond",1837,1841],["better",1918,1924],["pleasant",1981,1989],["better",2080,2086],["like",2307,2311],["boom",2316,2320],["gracefully",2460,2470],["fantastic",2501,2510],["right",2711,2716],["interesting",2970,2981],["humorous",3617,3625],["like",3691,3695],["pleasantly",4037,4047]],"neg_words":[["shrill",141,147],["lie",374,377],["fragile",537,544],["uncertain",635,644],["awkward",1107,1114],["lies",1222,1226],["wild",1401,1405],["wild",1477,1481],["primitive",1701,1710],["rocky",2147,2152],["offensive",2850,2859],["cave",3125,3129],["cave",3498,3502],["rocky",3540,3545],["wild",3782,3786],["hard",3921,3925],["afraid",3950,3956]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",3341,3345],["several days",4019,4031]],"times":[["A few minutes",796,809],["nearly two hours",1487,1503],["the evening",2550,2561],["the night before",2871,2887],["Later in the evening",3233,3253]],"distances":[["one foot",1166,1174]],"loc_advs":[["here",216,220],["opposite",895,903],["northward",1046,1055],["everywhere",1532,1542],["homeward",2195,2203],["there",2273,2278],["there",2682,2687]],"spa_preps":[["above",130,135],["over",565,569],["round",709,714],["about",715,720],["beyond",788,794],["along",941,946],["into",1134,1138],["along",1227,1232],["amongst",1342,1349],["about",1526,1531],["away",1885,1889],["along",1931,1936],["out",2120,2123],["through",2225,2232],["along",2257,2262],["into",2480,2484],["along",2608,2613],["below",3503,3508],["out",3686,3689],["about",3801,3806],["over",3987,3991]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0098765432,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984127283},{"para_id":384,"paragraph":"Note A.

George Postlethwaite, the erudite scribe, seems to have shared in the popular superstitions of his neighbours of 230 years ago, in attributing the plague to the malice and wicked propensities of a man of the name of Lancaster, who brought the pestilence neatly folded up in a parcel of ribbons.

Wicked Lancaster, thou didst study to excite the violence of the disease amongst thy neighbours, until Kirkby, one of his Majesty's justices of the peace, shut thee up in prison. Thou, O friend of death, didst lead very many people to invincible slaughter. Thy assiduity loaded the boat of Charon. What demon prompted thee to devise such horrible deeds?

Every evening after school hours, if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour, exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel at which he had sate for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping to a fro. Thus was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants, etc., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great benefit of his employers.

His garden also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his attendance; with this pastoral occupation he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to his own, less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["seat",293,297],["table",347,352],["country",1347,1354],["mountains",1541,1550],["fields",1842,1848]],"pos_words":[["extraordinary",44,57],["like",372,376],["master",409,415],["benefit",641,648],["eager",924,929],["gain",1134,1138],["great",1162,1167],["benefit",1168,1175],["great",1394,1399],["right",1513,1518]],"neg_words":[["urgent",252,258],["waste",829,834],["intense",1370,1377]],"events":[],"dates":[["each day",148,156],["five days",165,174],["the week",178,186],["Saturday",200,208],["one period of the year",1240,1262],["between Christmas and",1270,1291]],"times":[["eight hours",133,144],["Every evening",517,530],["school hours",537,549],["the night",1408,1417],["nights",1439,1445]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["above",18,23],["within",302,308],["out",1059,1062]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0440251572,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9944435954},{"para_id":444,"paragraph":"\" He also assisted his neighbours in hay-making and shearing their flocks, and in the performance of the latter service he was eminently dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented him with the present of a hay-cock or a fleece; less as a recompense for this particular service than as a general acknowledgement. The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy, the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the scripture and family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the church were also duly observed; but through every other day in the week, through every week in the year, he was incessantly occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he indulged himself with a newspaper, or sometimes with a magazine. The frugality and temperance established in his house were as admirable as the industry. Nothing to which the name of luxury could be given was there known; in the latter part of his life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general use, it was provided for visitors, and for such of his own family as returned occasionally to his roof, and had been accustomed to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and decent, but as simple as their diet; the homespun materials were made up into apparel by their own hands. A the time of the decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of their own spinning; and it is remarkable that the pew in the chapel in which the family used to sit, remains neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands. It is the only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations of modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their neighbours, consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their own labour. The lights by which, in the winter evenings their work was performed, were of their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the house affords. White candles, as tallow candles are here called, were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were perhaps produced on no other occasions. Once a month, during the proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and killed for the use of the family; and a cow, towards the close of the year, was salted and dried for winter provision; the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes. By these various resources, this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family, not only preserving them, as he affectingly says,' from wanting the necessaries of life;' but affording them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves in society. In this they were eminently assisted by the effects of their father's example, his precepts and injunctions; he was aware that truth-speaking, a a moral virtue, is best secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on trivial occasions; and so rigid were the rules of honesty by which he endeavoured to bring up his family, that if one of them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least use or value, without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged, he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place from which it had been brought.\"","file_id":"1861_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["church",478,484],["house",829,834],["cottage",1437,1444],["chapel",1587,1593],["chapel",1725,1731],["house",1864,1869],["cottages",2111,2119],["house",2199,2204],["mountain",2437,2445],["lanes",3269,3274],["fields",3278,3284]],"pos_words":[["dexterous",137,146],["holy",353,357],["work",614,618],["admirable",843,852],["luxury",899,905],["comely",1266,1272],["decent",1277,1283],["thrifty",1417,1424],["remarkable",1556,1566],["neatly",1635,1641],["distinguished",1735,1748],["delicate",1807,1815],["modern",1834,1840],["like",1871,1875],["work",2017,2021],["proper",2387,2393],["virtue",3037,3043],["best",3048,3052],["honesty",3166,3173]],"neg_words":[["strict",335,341],["incessantly",590,601],["worn",1243,1247],["killed",2457,2463],["trivial",3116,3123],["rigid",3142,3147]],"events":[],"dates":[["Sunday",363,369],["day",534,537],["the week",541,549],["every week",559,569],["the year",573,581],["Saturday",688,696],["the winter",1991,2001],["Christmas",2292,2301],["a month",2367,2374],["season",2394,2400],["the year",2523,2531],["winter",2558,2564]],"times":[["afternoon",697,706]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",925,930],["elsewhere",1172,1181],["here",2251,2255],["without",3321,3328]],"spa_preps":[["through",514,521],["through",551,558],["into",1004,1008],["into",1350,1354],["close",2514,2519]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0462633452,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9982813597},{"para_id":445,"paragraph":"Speaking of the seemingly unfavourable circumstances in which Mr. Walker lived for the cultivation of the mind and the display of its graces, Wordsworth says: -\" But, in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were reconciled.

But the reader will find there an account of my first arrival at the well-known house of Mr. William Ritson, the\" Huntsman's Inn,\" at Wastdale Head. In the same place there is an allusion to a conversation between Mr. Ritson and the Borrowdale guide concerning the feeding of hunting-dogs, on which subject I learnt that Ritson was a good authority. I found, also, that in addition to their fame as guides, and their general good qualities the Ritsons have been notable as bold hunters and crags-men among those wild mountains. The extraordinary chase, described in the following extract, took place a few days after my visit to Wastdale Head, in the autumn of 1860. The description is so very spirit-stirring in itself, that I do not like to pass it by; and as, in addition to that, at least three of the persons mentioned in connection with this unparalleled fox-hunt, are persons I met with at Mr. Ritson's house. I insert it here, as it appeared in the Ulverstone Advertiser, in the month of November 1860: -\" The Coniston subscription hounds threw off on Holmfell, about two miles of Coniston. Only seventeen dogs were uncoupled, all, however, of the right sort, and in condition to run for a man's life. They quickly hit on a drag, and\" Reynard,\" no doubt hearing them, stole away, and so got, it is conjectured, three - quarter's of an hour's start before they dragged up to his resting-place. They then settled on the line of the scent, at a rattling pace round the Fell to the Yew Trees, and across the country to the Tarns, near Hawkshead. He had been going upwind for this three to four miles, and turned back over High Cross, past the lake residence of Mr. Marshall, and on to Yewdale Crag. The ascent is long, steep, and one of the roughest amongst the northern fells, from the great quantity of loose stones on the sides of the hill. When out on the top, reynard, it is probable, thought he would bid a final adieu to his pursuers. He proceeded right on end over a long tract of moor and hill to near Black Hall, the highest house in Seathwaite. Here he made a round and steered back to Tilberthwaite mines, above Coniston, turned again and boldly ascended Tilberthwaite High Fell, which he crossed, and over a long rough tract of country to Wrynose, a steep mountain pass well known to tourists between Eskdale and Langdale. On Wrynose he lay down amongst some furze, and a second glorious unkennel took place. The chase had continued, without a check, for fully thirty miles over some of the roughest hill country of the north, and went on at a great pace by Red Tarn to the foot of Bow Fell, with one or two exceptions, the highest mountain in England. All the hardy footmen of Coniston and Seathwaite were\" tailed off.\" Reynard fearlessly ascended the mighty hill and crossed some little distance from the summit, then by the Stake at the head of Langdale and into Borrowdale. A few shepherds from Langdale followed and were joined by some Borrowdale men. After a round, the gallant fox took Butterikeld High Fell and all were\" tailed off\" again. Then by Eskhause over Scawfell, upwards of 3000 feet above the sea, to Wastdale Head. This dale with Mosedale Bottom is a flat of between four and five hundred acres, surrounded on three sides by the highest hills, Scawfell, Lingmell, Kirkfell, and Great Gable. They made several rounds on the hill sides, and three dogs got crag-fast on Scafell. The chase had lasted for six hours and it was getting dark. Again the gallant fox faced the hills over Stye Head into Borrowdale and then back again to Wastdale head, some twelve miles of fearful ground to go over. The chase, was, however, not near over. Leaving Wastdale the hounds were heard through Copeland Forest, Gillerthwaite, and to Ennerdale Lake. They ran clear round the lake. It was night, and the residents on its borders could not join, but listened with pleasure and surprise to the cry of the dogs awakening the echoes of the hills. About nine o'clock, the inhabitants of the secluded dale of Wastdale, about retiring to rest, were startled by the cry of the hounds coming back from Ennerdale. They could of course make nothing out by following them, but judged by the still cheerful cry of the hounds that they went through the valley and headed away by the long mountainous pass of Styehead for Borrowdale. On such a calm night the deep tone of the fox-hound was heard amongst the hills at a great distance. The Ritsons and others listened delighted awhile, till their practised ears were greeted three different times with the savage bark of the dogs, a sure indication they were viewing. Then there was no further sound heard. Perfect stillness reigned over hill and valley. Next day some of the dogs wandered into Wastdale, bit about the face and bloody, shewing that the death fight had taken place between them and the stoutest fox remembered in the north. A young man named Burns and the Ritsons the day following recovered the crag-fast dogs by lowering the former down the rocks with ropes. None but those accustomed to rescue sheep would have attempted such a hazardous feat as to be swung down the rocks to a narrow ledge and from the dizzy height several hundred feet of clear space beneath. The huntsman arrived next day at Wastdale, and all the dogs were got together except one. This, worn out, and nearly dead, did not arrive at Coniston till the end of the week.\" This small pack - hardly ever over twenty - has been long famed for speed, stoutness and acute nose. Twelve years ago they killed twenty - eight foxes in twenty - nine consecutive unkennels.
