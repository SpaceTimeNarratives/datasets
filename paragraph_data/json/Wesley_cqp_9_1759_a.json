Whence came this Woman's Pain? ( Which she would never have told, had she never been questioned about it:) From fretting for the Death of her Son. And what availed Medicines, while that fretting continued? Why then do not all Physicians consider, How far Bodily Disorders are caused or influenced by the Mind? And in those Cases, which are utterly out of their Sphere, call in the Assistance of a Minister, as Ministers when they find the Mind disordered by the Body, call in the Assistance of a Physician?

I enquired into a signal Instance of Providence. When a Coal Pit runs far under the Ground, it is customary here to build a Partition Wall, from the Bottom to the Top of it, nearly from the Shaft to within three or four Yards of the End, in order to make the Air circulate, which then moves one Side of the Wall, turns at the End, and moves briskly up on the other Side. In a Pit two Miles from the Town, which ran full four Hundred Yards under the Ground, and had been long neglected, several Parts of this Wall were fallen down. Four Men were sent down to repair it. They were about three Hundred Yards from the Shaft, when the foul Air took Fire. In a Moment it tore down the Wall from End to End, and burning on till it came to the Shaft, it then burst and went off like a large Cannon. The Men instantly fell on their Faces, or they would have been burnt to Death in a few Moments. One of them who once knew the Love of God,( Andrew English,) began crying aloud for Mercy. But in a very short Time his Breath was stopped. The other three crept on their Hands and Knees, till two got to the Shaft and were drawn up; but one of them died in a few Minutes. John M'Combe was drawn up next, burnt from Head to Foot, but rejoicing and praising God. They then went down for Andrew, whom they found senseless, the very Circumstance which saved his Life. For losing his Senses, he lay flat on the Ground, and the greatest Part of the Fire went over him: Whereas had he gone forward on his Hands and Knees, he would undoubtedly have been burnt to Death. But Life or Death was welcome.
