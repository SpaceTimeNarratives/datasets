The road which skirts this building has been built with singular solidity. Many of the blocks forming the edge or basement wall of the road are about a ton in weight. Doubtless some of the larger boulders have occasionally been used almost in situ, but many others must have been collected or rolled down the fell-side to serve as a support for this mountain road. The road has been called by some a' pack-horse road,' but why a road merely for this kind of conveyance should be built in so massive a style is difficult indeed to conceive. In one place between Stenock and Westhead Farm the boulders are built up to five or six feet high for a space of forty or fifty feet. It is a noteworthy fact that this road is now( 1890) being used by the heavy waggons of the Manchester Corporation contractors. It is much wider in some places than other, obviously for the purpose of allowing conveyances to wait and give passage. The amount of building contained in the portion lying between Westhead and Stenock should be carefully observed.

Returning from the west side of Thirlmere when the sun had lately dipped behind the crags of Armboth, I was traversing the lower road that winds through Dale Head Park. Deep undertones of green and gray, purple and brown wrapped the valley in a delicious and softened harmony of colour, blending delightfully with the evening stillness. Brighter lights painted the heights of the rocks and fells. As I turned to survey the track I had passed over, an exclamation of rapture and delight burst spontaneously from my lips at the sight that suddenly presented itself.

To this it may be replied, that if an observer were so placed as to obtain a distinct and near view of the component particles of the cloud, he might( and probably would) observe a very rapid motion among them. For at a distance of several miles appearances are very deceptive as to material composition, movement of particles, etc.; and it is also plain that identity of visible form at two different moments is no proof whatever of an identity of component particles. Take, for example, the rainbow, which exhibits such exquisite symmetry and such apparent stability of form as altogether to preclude the idea of change or motion, while it is well known that the bow and its colouring are due to refraction of light through a constant succession of falling drops, so that not only do two persons see different rainbows, but no one can see the same rainbow two moments together.","file_id":"1892_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["afford",3,9],["rapid",612,617],["exquisite",948,957],["stability",985,994],["well",1071,1075]],"neg_words":[["cloud",249,254],["cloud",560,565],["deceptive",693,702],["falling",1177,1184]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["several miles",658,671]],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["near",516,520],["among",625,630],["through",1144,1151],["together",1296,1304]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0089285714,"vader_sentiment":-0.39,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9911316037},{"para_id":273,"paragraph":"A singular phenomenon may often be noticed in connection with rain, which has not been fully explained, viz. the darting to and fro of small particles among the larger drops, like minute snowflakes flitting about in defiance of gravitation.","file_id":"1892_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["like",175,179]],"neg_words":[["defiance",216,224]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["minute",180,186]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["among",151,156],["about",207,212]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.36,"roberta_sentiment":0.9918988943},{"para_id":274,"paragraph":"In the symmetrical marking which the pyramid cumulus occasionally assumes, we have a remarkable resemblance to the form taken by the whirling sand-pillar of the desert.

These generally owe their origin to geographical configuration, and their study lies as much within the province of the physical geographer as that of the meteorologist. The curious disc or cap which is seen near the peak of some mountains, and which maintains its form in a breeze of wind, must have its particles in rapid motion; being caused by the continuous impact of vapour currents upon a colder stratum, which determines condensation and visibility. This is a good example of the principle stated above, that identity of the visible form at two different moments is no proof of identity in the particles. The flame of a candle, which cannot, chemically, remain the same two moments together, affords also an illustration of this. A cloud, like the human body, may often be likened to an eddy. Physiology teaches us that the body is sustained by a constant motion of particles absorbed from external sources and passed off again after undergoing a change of form; yet no one doubts that he possesses the same body which he had, say, ten years ago. The saying that' sameness' must not be confounded with' thisness' and' thatness'( or identity) in its strict sense, is applicable in both cases.

This remark applies also to the walls, devoid of mortar, that mark the higher ground. The latter are, however, subject to continual rebuilding of the upper portion, each farmer being responsible for his own. The work of man, even here, has had a considerable effect in modifying nature. Allusion has been made to the' bloom-smithies' and their influence first in denuding and afterwards covering the country again with plantations. So thick were the woods in former days between the Valley of Wythburn and the town of Keswick, that it is said to have been a remark of the natives, that a squirrel might have travelled from Wythburn Church to Keswick without ever touching ground. Whether the Manchester Corporation will think it desirable to plant afresh upon the hill-sides, now bare enough in most parts, remains to be seen. The ground is, first and foremost, a watershed for the Lake of Thirlmere-- now, or soon to be, a reservoir for the city of Manchester. Will the extension of the woods increase the quantity or improve the quality of the water? Experts much decide. But one thing seems plain enough, that woods upon a hill-side must tend to moderate its descent. It is, I believe, allowed that where a large tract of land with heavy rain-fall has been much stripped, the torrents have become the more unmanageable, and floods more dangerous and excessive.
