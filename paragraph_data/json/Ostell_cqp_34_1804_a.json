It was not, however, without some diffi-culty, that I could conjecture what part of the island would be most productive of the species ofinformation I was in quest of. On the Continent, particularly in France and Germany, mineralogical works abound. In Great Britain, particularly the southern part of it, hardly any travels of of consequence that may serve as guides to the geologist are extant. If we except Mr. A. Aikin's Tour into North wales, Dr. Maton's into the Western Counties, and Mr. Mawes' into Derbyshire, scarcely any useful information on the subject of mineralogy occurs. It was reserved for an amiable and intelligent foreigner, M. Fauias de St. Fond, todescribe a part of the highly interesting Kingdom of North Britain; yet the Works of all these four Writers, however diligent and meritorious, must be like what I am aboutto produce, extremely imperfect and incomplete. And surely the reason is plain enough. In mountainous countries, a long residence in only one county, or province, is requisite.

The other branch from Wilts through the counties of Hants, Surrey, and Sussex, is stopt only by the ocean; the whole, or at least the greatest part, of the isle of Thanet being almost entirely composed of chalk. But the branch in queftion ramifying from the samecounty of Wilts to the north of the Thames, is more involved in ob-scurity; I have not the least idea how far the chalk stratum extends this way. At Woobur commences a deep sandy declivity. We got out of our carriage to assist the horses. Sand stones for repairing the road, were lying on the road-side, and they continue with little orno interruption till a few miles beyond Northamp Ton. These sand stones contain frequently no small portion of the oxide of iron. I could not help remarking to myself, how, throughout al-most all the south of England, I had seen sand stone eminences were almosst the constant concomitants of chalk eminences. In no in-stance, perhaps, isthis more observable than in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, where a stratum of sand stone from Kent, in the neighbourhood of Maidstone, traverses the counties ofSurrey and Sussex; acquires some degree of elevation in the neighbourhood of Midhurst and Petworth, and on the lofty chalk hulls between Midhurst and Arundel, its parallelismwith its chalky neighbours above it, and the direction it takes from east to west, may be very clearly and distinctly viewed. Little remarkable occursi n the part of the county of Leicester through which we passed, or in the southern part of Derbyshire. At Ashbourn begins that district which is called the Peak. From hence to Buxton the soil was composed of sand stone, free stone, and lime stone, as yet no schistus appearednear the road. Buxton has been so often described, that it would be idle to give here a description of it. Let us hear what Mr. Mawe and Fauias de St. Fond say of it. Speaking of Buxton, says the former,\" the traveller will be much surprised to see a building in this remote part of the kingdom that rivals the beauty of Palmira.\" Buxton,\" says the latter,\" is situated in the midst of the most dismal and cheerless country I ever saw. Its waters may be excel-lent, but most certainly its atmosphereis impregnated with sadness and melancholy. The houses almost entirely of an uniform appear-ance, resemble hospitals, or rather monastic establishments. A superb structure, executed in a grand and beautiful stile of architecture, which appears at the bottom of the place, and is appropriated to the baths, might be taken for the palace of theabbot.\" For my part I think the latter is nearest to the truth. It is cer - tainly a cheerlefs, dreary tract, and unlike other mountainous countries is totally devoid of the picturesque. As you proceed from Bux Ton to Manchester, there are a fewachistose strata occasionally intersecting the lime and sand stone.

Sometimesthey gradually recide from your view, and often re-appear when you least expect them. This chain is more or less visible all the way to Lancaster, at a few miles fromwhich place it unites itself to the great tempestuous sea of mountains, occu-pying almost the whole of Westmoreland, and a very great part of the neighbouring county ofCumberland.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["Oxford",363,369],["Suffolk",514,521],["Thames",847,853],["England",1356,1363],["Kent",1513,1517],["Kent",1585,1589],["Derbyshire",2067,2077],["Peak",2132,2136],["Buxton",2152,2158],["Buxton",2266,2272],["Buxton",2430,2436],["Buxton",2582,2588],["Manchester",3310,3320],["Manchester",3437,3447],["Apennines",3651,3660],["Lancaster",3807,3816],["Westmoreland",3940,3952]],"geonouns":[["hills",133,138],["ridge",308,313],["isle",705,709],["carriage",1019,1027],["stones",1055,1061],["road",1080,1084],["road",1104,1108],["stones",1212,1218],["stone",1381,1386],["stone",1574,1579],["county",1995,2001],["district",2103,2111],["stone",2189,2194],["stone",2201,2206],["stone",2217,2222],["road",2260,2264],["building",2502,2510],["country",2667,2674],["waters",2691,2697],["houses",2798,2804],["countries",3231,3240],["stone",3398,3403],["ground",3453,3459],["mountains",3584,3593],["sea",3891,3894],["mountains",3898,3907],["county",3996,4002]],"pos_words":[["greatest",63,71],["greatest",683,691],["clearly",1920,1927],["remarkable",1958,1968],["free",2196,2200],["beauty",2562,2568],["excel",2705,2710],["superb",2905,2911],["grand",2937,2942],["beautiful",2947,2956],["picturesque",3266,3277],["great",3873,3878],["great",3965,3970]],"neg_words":[["abruptly",405,413],["ignorant",539,547],["lying",1091,1096],["interruption",1150,1162],["idle",2319,2323],["dismal",2646,2652],["cheerless",2657,2666],["sadness",2770,2777],["melancholy",2782,2792],["dreary",3188,3194],["devoid",3252,3258],["lose",3547,3551]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",3510,3516]],"times":[],"distances":[["a few miles",1168,1179],["a few miles",3821,3832]],"loc_advs":[["throughout",48,58],["here",262,266],["here",400,404],["beyond",1180,1186],["throughout",1320,1330],["here",2332,2336],["there",3322,3327]],"spa_preps":[["through",577,584],["out",1008,1011],["between",1780,1787],["above",1852,1857],["through",2015,2022]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0027855153,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9804209471},{"para_id":47,"paragraph":"Between Manchester and Chorley you have a most superb and interesting view, since you have not only these Apennines to the right, but to the west you have the Denbighshiremountains, thereby giving you, as on a map, a clear idea of the vast plain that lies between these two ridges of mountains, which plainly shews that there is no continuity of chain. This country has been so ably describedby Dr. Aikin, in his History of Manchester, that little could have been added by me worth detailing, even had I staid any time in this singular country. I shall onlypermit myself a few observations presently on this subject, when speaking of the population of Manchester, and the general character of its inhabitants. Before you arriveat Manchester, you pass through Stock Port, a very thriving, flourishing town; the number of inhabitants here, it was told me, had in-creased in ten years from 6 to 25,000: so rapid an increase as this is surely not to be credited. Dr. Aikin, in 1794, estimates the population at 15,000. With so respectable a document as this in our hands, we may be certain, that whether the actual population be now 25,000 or not,( an assertion I have no means either of admitting or disproving,) it could not have quadrupledits numbers in ten years. This would making the Stockport women prolific in replenishing the earth, their Trans Atlantic sisters of Vermont and Kentucky. From hence to Manchester you are perpetually put in mind of the filthy environs of London, particularly those of Camden Town, Somer's Town, and Islington. Stockport, as wellas Manchester, is built almost entirely of brick, and there are great quantities made in the neighbourhood; this resembles Middlesex again, where brick-making employssuch numbers of people. The town of Manchester is utterly unlike any other I have seen in Great Britain, or out of it. The streets, like those of Birmingham, soon acquirethat dirty and dingy hue for which the latter is so conspi-cuous. I should think, however, Birmingham the most preferable residence of the two, for those whose businessmight oblige them to re-sort to each of these places. They are certainly neither of them spots for those who are fond of exclaiming.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["Manchester",8,18],["Apennines",106,115],["Manchester",424,434],["Manchester",652,662],["Manchester",730,740],["Atlantic",1350,1358],["Manchester",1406,1416],["London",1475,1481],["Manchester",1568,1578],["Manchester",1767,1777],["Great Britain",1821,1834]],"geonouns":[["ridges",274,280],["mountains",284,293],["country",358,365],["country",536,543],["pass",746,750],["town",800,804],["town",1759,1763],["streets",1854,1861],["residence",2023,2032]],"pos_words":[["superb",47,53],["interesting",58,69],["right",123,128],["clear",217,222],["continuity",332,342],["worth",476,481],["thriving",778,786],["flourishing",788,799],["rapid",903,908],["respectable",1023,1034],["prolific",1302,1310],["great",1629,1634],["like",1863,1867],["preferable",2012,2022],["fond",2182,2186]],"neg_words":[["lies",251,255],["staid",504,509],["filthy",1456,1462],["utterly",1781,1788],["dirty",1906,1911]],"events":[],"dates":[["ten years",872,881],["6",887,888],["1794",973,977],["ten years",1253,1262]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",256,263],["there",320,325],["here",832,836],["there",1619,1624]],"spa_preps":[["through",751,758],["out",1839,1842]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0571428571,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966771603},{"para_id":48,"paragraph":"Flumins amem sylvasque inglorius.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981209636},{"para_id":49,"paragraph":"Or for those who wish,","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.4,"roberta_sentiment":0.9937404394},{"para_id":50,"paragraph":"Ducere sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969040751},{"para_id":51,"paragraph":"I know not how to compare Manchester, as I have just said, with any other town.

I staid there but a short time, and after a journey of 300 miles, did not find myself disposed for any long excursion from it. I walked indeed to Brampton, which is in the same plain with Carlisle; had I proceeded farther on to Gills Land, I should have reached the little moun-tainous slip of country, there very narrow whichconnects the Scotch and the English mountains. The plain in which Carlisle stands, is bounded to the east and south by lofty mountains, at a vast distance; to the north, if we consider the plain, notwithstanding the inter-vention of the Solway Firth, as extending into Galloway, it is bounded by the Skruffelt and other Scotch mountains: to the west and south west, in which may be comprehended the towns of Wigton, Maryport, and Allonby, it is bounded by the Irish sea: all this western part is flat andvery fruitful. Lime is to be had there at no very unreasonable rate, and on considering the latitude of this part, I was much struck with the excellence of the crops. But what fixed my attention most, was the nature of the stone every where to be met with in the vicinity of Carlisle. This stone was of very various colours: it was blue, grey, greyish-blue, violet, red, reddish-brown, brown. No rain had fallen forsome days, and the road was so covered with dust that I could not examine the specimens on the spot so well as I could have wished. I tried, but in vain, to break thosestones; I soon afterwards found it was necessary to have a very large hammer to do it. These stones are the Trap of the Swedes, and Whin stones of the Scotch. Since M. St. Fond mentioned his having seen fragments of granite and basaltes between Carlisle and Kendal, I looked very carefully for specimens of these, but could find none. Itill becomes me to speak at large of Trap. Those who travel into this part of the island in quest of mineralogical knowledge, must be referred for further information toSt. Fond's Travels, who after having given to the world the account of provinces in his own country, greatly similar to this part of Britain, is a well qualified andintelligent guide. - Mr. Kirwen in his mineralogy mentions several varieties of Trap. Of all of these I must profess my utter ignorance. Trap, Mullen, Wacken, Calp, Krag,&amp; c. It is singular that at Keswick, a labourer gave some specimens of Trap, lyingby the road side, this last appellation.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["Chester",158,165],["Carlisle",261,269],["Brampton",500,508],["Carlisle",542,550],["Carlisle",746,754],["Solway Firth",917,929],["Galloway",949,957],["Wigton",1088,1094],["Maryport",1096,1104],["Allonby",1110,1117],["Carlisle",1459,1467],["Carlisle",2012,2020],["Kendal",2025,2031],["Britain",2405,2412],["Keswick",2639,2646]],"geonouns":[["walls",254,259],["town",300,304],["street",324,330],["country",648,655],["mountains",716,725],["mountains",805,814],["mountains",1007,1016],["towns",1079,1084],["sea",1146,1149],["stone",1407,1412],["stone",1474,1479],["road",1618,1622],["stones",1860,1866],["stones",1904,1910],["island",2185,2191],["country",2364,2371],["road",2700,2704]],"pos_words":[["agreeable",20,29],["enough",35,41],["wisely",176,182],["neat",295,299],["spacious",340,348],["fruitful",1189,1197],["excellence",1326,1336],["well",1702,1706],["well",2419,2423],["qualified",2424,2433]],"neg_words":[["sadly",56,61],["staid",356,361],["unreasonable",1234,1246],["struck",1310,1316],["fallen",1589,1595],["dust",1643,1647],["vain",1747,1751],["break",1756,1761],["ignorance",2563,2572]],"events":[],"dates":[["days",1604,1608]],"times":[],"distances":[["300 miles",409,418]],"loc_advs":[["there",362,367],["there",657,662],["there",1217,1222]],"spa_preps":[["out",62,65],["apart",205,210],["into",944,948],["between",2004,2011],["into",2163,2167]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0042918455,"vader_sentiment":-0.76,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984599352},{"para_id":67,"paragraph":"From Carlisle to Wigton is eleven miles, through an highly cultivated country.

The accomodations at this inn are not sogood as at Keswick, but I made a very good dinner there. One of the Gentlemen who took up his quarters here for the purpose of fishing in the adjoining lake, and in the numerous tarns to be found in the neighbouring mountains here, had colletedsome stones I saw in the window: he very oblingingly offered me any of them I might chuse to take; I accepted of him a greenish stone of a moderate hardness, sprinkledwith blackish specks of some other substance, which I after-wards found to be chert, penetrated by schor-laceous actinolite, to which its colour might be ascribable, having in it minute portions of horn blende. This Gentleman, not content with giving me this specimen, accompanied me to the borders of the lake near to which it wastaken. It was probably a fragment of rock from Helvellyn, frowning tremendously above us just at this period. We proceeded to that part of Leathe's water where the lakeforms itself into a strait, and across which a foot-bridge is thrown, for the convenience of those who wish to pass on to the western border of the lake; you may then, if you are so inclined, proceed southwards back again to Wythburn, or Grasmere; but you cannot proceed north-wards on the western side to Keswick.

It was at this strait that parted the lake into two nearly equal divisions, that Istopped for some moments to behold the very wild as-pect of the upper or northernpart of it. it is viewed with tenfold advantage here: you have no idea of its wildness from the public road. It was from viewing it at this, or some other spot not fardistant from it, that perhaps Mr. Cumberland was induced, very aptly and justly, in his beautiful poem, to call it by the name of the\" savage\" Wythburn.

On BorrowdaleFells were to be Trap, Mullen, and porphyry, and but very little granite. Basanite, he said, was to be found on this side of Buttermere, and not on the other side of that water; and granite, \u00e8 converso, on that side, and not on this.

Wry Nose and Hard Knot, are nearly of the same composition, he informed me, as the three last. When you approachWast Water, at the east end you have Rowley Rag, and Trap, at the western, lime stone. A solid mass of granite runs up from Blae Crag to Red Pike, and at Mell Break issome granite, and bog iron ore, with the same greenish chert as on Helvellyn; and at High Stile is Trap again, and schistus. A stratum of granite runs from Red Pike, asdoes one of Trap and schistus to Ennerdale. As you go from Ennerdale towards Whitehaven the lime-stone stratum commences, and extends to near Cockermouth. Honister Cragis entirely of schist. Near Raven Glass is both granite and lime-stone. Whinlater is of quartz and schistus. Grasmire Hill, and White Side, are of schistus, with someparticles of red granite. At Castle Rig, in Borrowdale, is a large vein of Calcedony in Trap, and native arsenic is to be seen on the Buttermore mountains. Some schoerl may be found in the liberties of Borrow Dale.

This very diligent man has dis-covered cobalt and micaceous iron ore, between Buttermere and Borrowdale; and sulphuret of antimony to the left of Armathwaite. I had this account verbatim from Mr. Hutton. I trust I have no need to make any apology to such of my readers who are fond of the subject I have been expatiating upon, in particular-izing so minutely the component parts of each mountain. The fact is, it having been my in-tention tohave staid a much longer time at the Lakes than I did, I copied the foregoing account of Hutton for my own convenience, to be enabled with his assistance, or that of someother guide, to visit the spots themselves from whence some of the specimens in the museum had been dislodged. As it is now very improbable I shall soon revisit this en-chanting country, I conceive the account I have just prefixed may be serviceable to any future traveller, firmly imbued with the enthu-siastic desire of seeing the productionsof nature on the very spots from whence they have been taken. I have then given him his bill of fare, and such an one will perhaps think, that the foregoing catalogue is neither useless, nor too prolix. He oughthowever to be ad-vertised, that Hutton being the most intelli-gent guide in Keswick, is so much occupied from the beginning of June to the latter end of September, inescorting visitors to the Lakes, in the common routine, they most or all of them go( the number of which is now very great) that he can but seldom spare time for expeditions to any very remote sequestered parts. The best time, therefore, for visiting the mountains I have cited, is April, May, and October, when he is perfectlyfree from any other avocation.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["Helvellyn",0,9],["Mell Fell",247,256],["Buttermere",455,465],["Stake",567,572],["Pikes",627,632],["Eagle Crag",709,719],["Crag",977,981],["Red Pike",985,993],["Helvellyn",1082,1091],["High Stile",1100,1110],["Red Pike",1171,1179],["Ennerdale",1216,1225],["Ennerdale",1242,1251],["Whitehaven",1260,1270],["Cockermouth.",1325,1337],["Honister",1338,1346],["Whinlater",1423,1432],["Grasmire",1460,1468],["Castle",1546,1552],["Borrowdale",1561,1571],["Borrowdale",1765,1775],["Buttermere",1780,1790],["River Greta",1810,1821],["Buttermere",1901,1911],["Borrowdale",1916,1926],["Armathwaite",1969,1980],["Lakes",2301,2306],["Keswick",3065,3072],["Lakes",3181,3186]],"geonouns":[["stones",67,73],["stone",310,315],["water",501,506],["stone",928,933],["bog",1033,1036],["stone",1280,1285],["stone",1416,1421],["mountains",1662,1671],["mountain",2210,2218],["country",2612,2619],["common",3195,3201],["mountains",3410,3419]],"pos_words":[["solid",937,942],["diligent",1833,1841],["trust",2029,2034],["fond",2100,2104],["convenience",2371,2382],["great",3272,3277],["best",3371,3375]],"neg_words":[["staid",2269,2274],["improbable",2563,2573],["useless",2956,2963]],"events":[],"dates":[["the beginning of June",3099,3120],["September",3142,3151],["April, May",3437,3447],["October",3453,3460]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",220,225],["left",1961,1965]],"spa_preps":[["near",1320,1324],["between",1893,1900]],"normalised_sentiment":0.013559322,"vader_sentiment":0.87,"roberta_sentiment":0.924048543},{"para_id":118,"paragraph":"I proceed now to state a few more articles in Hutton's museum, for the sake of those who wish to visit is solely as an object of curiosity.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["object",119,125]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0833333333,"vader_sentiment":0.4,"roberta_sentiment":0.9869394302},{"para_id":119,"paragraph":"Beautiful white, black, greenish black, in short, variously coloured jade pebbles, from St. Bees, about the size of a pullet's egg.

Those who live in the south of England, have no idea of this substance; it forms no part of its soil; the streets of Lon Don are indeed manyof them paved with it, but these stones come from other parts of the island, and of the world, chiefly I believe from Aberdeenshire. It would appear that for the mostpart, the highest and the most elevated sposts on the earth are of this material. Mount Blanc, the great majestic sovereign of the Alps, is composed of it; it consists of three distinct substances. It was considered not very long since, as the product of fire, but this opinion seems very gradually to have lost ground. The celebratedProfessor Pallas, who has given an eloquent and vivid description of it, does not however take upon himself to combat the idea formerly entertained of it by Buffon, and other naturalists, viz. that it hasbeen formerly in a state of fusion. He rather seems to coincide with them,\" It may fairly be admitted as an axiom,\" says he,\" that the highest moun-tains of the globe, which form continued chains, such as the Swedish, Swiss, and Tyro Lian Alps, the mountains tha environ Bohe Mia, those of Siberia, Caucasus, and eventhe Andes themselves are of this rock, that has been denominated granite, whose base is always a quartz, more or less mixed with feltspath, mica, and little basaltes(scheorl), scattered here and there without order, and in irregular fragments of different proportions. This au-cient rock, and the sand produced byits de-composition form the basis of all our conti-nents.

Granite,\" he adds,\" seems to have been in a state of fusion, and to have been the product of fire. But it is not, perhaps, forman,\" continues he, with an humility highly be-coming his character,\" to investigate the real cause that has thrown this enormous mass of vetrified matter in the orbitwhere we are cir-culating; and the ingenous Author of Re Cherches sur les Americains, seems to be in the right when he says, that it would be just as ridiculous to write a treatise on the formation of stars as on that of these rocks, which have been erected by the puissant hands of all-crea-tive nature, to which we owe the little planeton which our philosophers pretend to reason.\" -[ Observations sur le Montagnes.]","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["England",226,233],["Mount Blanc",583,594],["Alps",632,636],["Alps",1278,1282],["Andes",1360,1365],["Alps",1880,1884]],"geonouns":[["streets",301,308],["stones",368,374],["island",404,410],["ground",813,819],["mountains",1288,1297],["rock",1389,1393],["rock",1639,1643],["mountains",1784,1793],["rock",1967,1971],["rocks",2549,2554]],"pos_words":[["work",189,193],["great",600,605],["majestic",606,614],["eloquent",870,878],["vivid",883,888],["fairly",1122,1128],["great",1824,1829],["humility",2183,2191],["right",2427,2432]],"neg_words":[["lost",808,812],["irregular",1579,1588],["ridiculous",2472,2482],["pretend",2686,2693]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",1542,1546],["there",1551,1556],["without",1557,1564],["below",1756,1761]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0218340611,"vader_sentiment":0.48,"roberta_sentiment":0.992634356},{"para_id":177,"paragraph":"The Riesen Geburge, I suppose he alludes to.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[["The Riesen Geburge",0,18]],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9902002215},{"para_id":178,"paragraph":"The name of granite is now refused to any ingredients but quartz, fellspath, and mica.

I have no reason for supposing it extends from Scotland farther than the four most northern English counties; I am inclined to think that neither the gigantic hills of Ingleborough, Penygent, Pendle Hill, or Whernside, are of this substance; but of this I cannot speak with confidence. I think I can speak with greater confidence of the Derbyshire and Staf Fordshire hills, whci though they are plainly a continuation of the Scotch mountains, yet contain no granite. Granite then may be said to take its rise from three distinct parts of Great Britain, Scotland, Carnavrvonshire, and Dartmoor in Devon; but these granitic tracts never unite with each other, but are thoroughly separate and distinct chains. Immense plains, as well as mountains of another description, besides the Bristol Channel, divid the Devonshire granite, for instance from that of North Wales; and the Shropshire hills which are a continuation of the latter, form no sort of union with the Staffordshire range, as might at first be supposed, but are intersected from each other by a tolerably large tract of flat country. What however is most worthy of remark is, that the northern provinces of France, opposite to us, notwithstanding the interventionof the British Channel, completely answer to our English counties in respect to soil; the shores of each country corresponding nearly with their opposite strata. Thewhole almost of Britanny is granite, so is Cornwall. In Nor Mandy, as in Dorsetshire, the chalky soil be-gins and continues to extend itself through Picardy towards Artoisand Flanders, as the latter does into Kent. Nay, more, this analogy becomes more perfect as the oceans widens. The Flemish and Dutch shores are low, flat, and morassy; so are the eastern ones of England.","file_id":"1804_a","plnames":[["Great Britain",293,306],["Scotland",343,351],["Devon",436,441],["Wales",446,451],["North Wales",668,679],["Scotland",762,770],["Ingleborough",883,895],["Pendle Hill",907,918],["Whernside",923,932],["Derbyshire",1052,1062],["Great Britain",1253,1266],["Scotland",1268,1276],["Devon",1311,1316],["Bristol",1495,1502],["Devonshire",1522,1532],["North Wales",1568,1579],["France",1882,1888],["Cornwall",2146,2154],["Dorsetshire",2176,2187],["Kent",2312,2316],["England",2469,2476]],"geonouns":[["island",156,162],["isles",369,374],["districts",631,640],["hills",874,879],["hills",1082,1087],["mountains",1147,1156],["mountains",1449,1458],["hills",1600,1605],["country",1800,1807],["shores",2028,2034],["country",2043,2050],["shores",2407,2413]],"pos_words":[["great",66,71],["beneficent",72,82],["great",410,415],["great",496,501],["confidence",989,999],["confidence",1034,1044],["well",1441,1445],["worthy",1830,1836],["respect",2007,2014],["perfect",2355,2362]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",685,689],["there",694,699]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",1890,1898],["opposite",2083,2091],["through",2244,2251],["into",2307,2311]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0465116279,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.987703681},{"para_id":182,"paragraph":"What, is curious, however, as you enter the Baltic( I know not what is the soil of Jutland, and therefore cannot compare it with the con - tiguous coast of Norway) this doctrine seems to be reversed, the shores of Sweden and Fin Land being totally different from those of the southern side of that sea. The shores of the two former are granitic; those of Mecklen Burg, Brandenburgh, and Poland, low and sandy. It is impossible to quit this subject without saying a word or twoon lakes. Lakes are generally to be found either in very moun-tainous, or very flat countries. The moun-tainous sort are to be seen in Sweden, Swisser Land, the northernpart of Italy, Scotland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Carnarvonshire, Merionethshire, c. The lakes I am now speaking of, exist almost all of them in the neighbourhoodof granite. The second sort are to be seen in soils entirely alluvial, viz. in the Dutch provinces of Friseland and Overyssel, Mecklenburgh, Lithuania, c. and in our own contry there are Whittlesea, Ramsey, and Ugg Meres, with many other of these waters in Huntingdon, Cambridge, and Lincolnshire. The fish, it may be observed, thatsubsist in Alpine lakes, are some of them very different from those which live in the lakes I have just mentioned. No on, for instance, I should think, ever saw the char, the gwyniad, or the grayling; in the lakes of flat countries, or the burbot, the stickleback, or bream, I should suppose, in the Alpine; though pike, peach, eels, and even trout, it must beconfessed, are common to both. I believe I am making a true assertion when I say that the aquatic plants growing in each of these sorts of lakes, are also very different. The Isoctes lacustris and Lobelia Dortmanna, I never heard of in the lakes of flat countries, nor amongst the mountains have i ever seen the beautiful Stratiotes alodes, or Hydrocharis morsus ranae. The elegant nymphaeae are indeed to be seen in both. But what particularly showstheir distinct nature, is the surrounding atmosphere of each. No pestilential miasmata proceed from the Alpine lakes, whereas from those of a different description, the noxious effects resulting from them are too well and fatally known for me to expatiate on for an instant. These last are likewise more the resort of the Amphibia thanthe Alpine ones. In Lithuania, where these sorts of lakes are to the full as abundant as any part of Europe, the serpents have been de-scribed to be the scourge of theinhabitants of that province. The little town of Sluck is surrounded by lakes infested with serpents of an astonishing size, that very frequently attack foot passengers.

At pre-sent, even this sketch or outline, is faint and feeble indeed, compared with what it might have been, had my residence been only a month longer there. I was moreover singularly fortu-nate in having a description of the coutry about Shap, sent meby a very able and accurate pen, a line of country uncommonly interesting to the lithologist. I had purposed to have ex-plored it with the utmost care and circumspec-tion; my blow-pipe I was in dailyexpectation of, and every thing seemed to promise me an abundant harvest of delight and instruction. From a visit to the mountains around Hawes Water, and in Martindale Forest, I had pro-mised myself great pleasure. But regrets are futile and useless. Perhaps at some future pe-riod it may be my fate to revisit this happy country, thoughwith greater ardour and en-thusiasm that I did this summer is impossible. From Penrith I took a place in one of the Lon Don coaches. To get into Yorkshire, you pass avery narrow slip, between Appleby and Brough, of the British Apennines. This seems to be almost the narrowest part of the whole chain, not far from the place where theseApennines( as appears from Housman's map) bifurcate. When you have got over this pass, and have proceeded a few miles into Yorkshire, the face of the country changes, itis no longer mountainous, but swells into gentle eminences, the soil is of lime-stone, and this kind of soil is more or less observable, till you arrive in Lincolnshire, where the chalk-stone strata com-mence near Grantham. Surely this cannot be a continuation of the Cambridge and Bedford Shire hills? At any other time than that I was travelling, I might have had occasion to ad-mire the extreme fertility of theparts of Lin Coln and Huntingdonshire, I had been passing through; but these objects for one who panted for a cooler and less scorching atmosphere, had but few charms.
