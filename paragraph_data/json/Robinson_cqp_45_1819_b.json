The name of the giant's grave, which this singular monument has retained through a succession of ages, and the rude sculpture on one part of it, render it probable that it was erected to the memory of some British prince or chief, and seem to favour the traditionary story, that it is the tomb of Sir Ewan or Hugh CaeSARIUS, a man of great courage, who was successful in clearing the forest of Inglewood from the ferocious wild boars, which in those remote times infested the neighbouring country.

This fence is very singular in its construction: the stones seem to have been collected from the adjacent river; and no kind of cement appears to have been used in forming the fence. Not far from the centre of the circle stands a massy column of unhewn stone, eleven feet in height, and near the middle twenty - two feet in circumference; this stone is a species of freestone, and appears to have been taken from the surface, and not obtained in any quarry. Some old persons in the neighbourhood say that there were two or three more stones of a similar nature, standing in a position with this, so as to form a square; but as the stones were injurious to the land, the rest have been destroyed and removed. This rude construction is evidently of remote antiquity; but of the various conjectures which have been formed respecting its use, few appear to rest on any solid foundation. Tradition says, that this place was a Roman amphitheatre, where criminals were compelled to combat with wild beasts, and that these stones were intended to afford a refuge to the unhappy men, during the dreadful period of the conflict. \" The use of this accumulation,\" observes Mr. Pennant,\" seems to have been the same with that called Bryn Gwyn, at Trer Dryw, in Anglesey, a supreme consistory of druidical administration, as the British name imports. That in Anglesey is constructed in the same manner with this; but at present there are no remains of columns in the interior part.\" Some writers, supposing Mayburgh to be a corruption of Maiden Burg, a title frequently given to fortresses esteemed impregnable, are of opinion that this was a British fortification; but the larger stone erected in the centre, and the others which formerly stood near it, overthrow this conjecture, and prove that this could not have been its appropriation. The elevated ground upon which Mayburgh is situated, the shadowy wood that surrounds it, and the rude column near the centre, incline us to adopt the opinion of Mr. Hutchinson, who thinks that it was a temple of the Druids, where, under the shade of the consecrated grove, they exercised their religious rites, taught the multitude, and initiated their pupils in the mysteries of their religion.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Maybrough",57,66],["Mayburgh",1699,1707],["Mayburgh",2064,2072]],"geonouns":[["table",36,41],["hill",70,74],["stones",128,134],["summit",144,150],["stones",259,265],["river",312,317],["stone",459,464],["stone",550,555],["quarry",656,662],["stones",740,746],["stones",837,843],["land",866,870],["stones",1221,1227],["stone",1873,1878],["ground",2046,2052],["wood",2098,2102],["grove",2299,2304]],"pos_words":[["solid",1071,1076],["afford",1245,1251],["supreme",1466,1473]],"neg_words":[["injurious",849,858],["rude",919,923],["wild",1193,1197],["unhappy",1268,1275],["dreadful",1292,1300],["conflict",1315,1323],["corruption",1716,1726],["overthrow",1947,1956],["shadowy",2090,2097],["rude",2130,2134]],"events":[["Round",30,35]],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["half a mile",6,17],["eleven feet",466,477],["twenty - two feet",509,526]],"loc_advs":[["there",711,716],["there",1620,1625]],"spa_preps":[["near",493,497],["near",1938,1942],["near",2142,2146],["under",2264,2269]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0343137255,"vader_sentiment":-0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966997504},{"para_id":64,"paragraph":"The word Maiden has sometimes the acceptation of military, as the Maiden Ways in Northumberland.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Northumberland",81,95]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.32,"roberta_sentiment":0.9878498912},{"para_id":65,"paragraph":"See History of Cumberland, vol. i. p. 311.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Cumberland",15,25]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9916983843},{"para_id":66,"paragraph":"About half a mile beyond Eamont Bridge is Brougham Hall, the seat of Henry Brougham, Esq.

His observations are as follow:--\" A grey autumnal day, the air perfectly calm and mild, went to see Ullswater, five miles distant; soon left the Keswick road, and turned to the left through shady lanes along the vale of Eamont, which runs rapidly on near the way, rippling over the stones: to the right is Dalemain, a large fabric of pale red stone, with nine windows in the front and seven on the side, built by Mr. Hasell; behind it a fine lawn surrounded by woods, and a long rocky eminence rising over them; a clear and brisk rivulet runs by the house to join the Eamont, whose course is in sight and at a small distance. Further on appears Hutton St. John, a castle-like old mansion of Mr. Huddleston. Approached Dunmallet, a fine pointed hill, covered with wood, planted by old Mr. Hasell before-mentioned, who lives always at home, and delights in planting. Walked over a spongy meadow or two, and began to mount the hill, through a broad straight green alley among the trees, and with some toil gained the summit. From hence saw the lake open directly at my feet, majestic in its calmness, clear and smooth as a blue mirror, with winding shores and low points of land covered with green inclosures, while farm-houses looking out among the trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almost every where bordered with cultivated lands, gently sloping upwards, from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, till they reach the feet of the mountains, which rise very rude and awful with their broken tops on either hand. Directly in front, at better than three miles distance, Place Fell, one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the lake, and forces it to alter its course, joining first a large bay to the left, and then bending to the right. I descended Dunmallet again, by a side avenue, that was only not perpendicular, and came to Barton Bridge over the Eamont, then walking through a path in the wood round the bottom of the hill, came forth where the Eamont issues out of the lake, and continued my way along its western shore, close to the water, and generally on a level with it. The lake is nine miles long; and at widest under a mile in breadth.

The effect of the first is not over, when the echoes of the second, the third, and perhaps the fourth begin. Such a variety of awful sounds, mixing and commixing, and at the same time heard from all sides, have a wonderful effect on the mind; as if the foundations of every rock on the lake were giving way; and the whole scene, from some strange convulsion, were falling into general ruin. But there is another species of echoes, which are as well adapted to the lake in all its stillness and tranquility, as the others are to its wildness and confusion; and which recommend themselves chiefly to those feelings, which depend on the graver movements of the mind. Instead of cannon, let a few French horns and clarionets be introduced. Softer music than such loud wind-instruments would scarce have power to vibrate. The effect is now wonderfully changed. The sound of cannon is heard in bursts. It is the modified music of thunder. But the continuation of musical sounds forms a continuation of musical echoes, which reverberating around the lake, are exquisitely melodious in their several gradations, and form a thousand symphonies, playing together from every part.

The natural variety of colouring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful and pleasing; the ruling tints in the valley being those of azure, green and gold, yet ever various, arising from the intermixture of the lake, the woods, the grass, and corn-fields: these are finely contrasted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow streams of light, the purple hues, and misty azure of the mountains.

Hence you proceed up the northern side of the mountain Sparkling towards Sty Head, a steep and precipitous crag, from which the eye looks down with terror, and from the summit of which is a grand view of Skiddaw and Saddleback. This summit forms a rocky plain, not quite half a mile in extent, and environed( except a narrow passage at each extremity) by a circle of steep slaty crags; and in its centre is Sty Head tarn, a small but deep lake, about three quarters of a mile in circumference, and abounding with the finest trout. The scenery around this place is calculated to inspire emotions of the most awful kind; but on reaching the brow, on the opposite side of Sty Head, a most delightful view opens to the eye: below, the River Wastdale is seen falling from the adjacent mountains; at the bottom, are the fertile dale and village of Wastdale, with the lake of Wastwater beyond; and on either side rise mountains of stupendous height, particularly Sea Fell, which is said to be the loftiest mountain in England, and the height of which, according to the trigonometrical survey, is 3165 feet above the level of the sea.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Borrowdale",12,22],["Borrowdale",128,138],["Grange",320,326],["Derwent",371,378],["Borrowdale",407,417],["Sty Head",581,589],["Skiddaw",712,719],["Saddleback",724,734],["Sty Head",915,923],["Sty Head",1177,1185],["River",1239,1244],["Wastdale",1245,1253],["Wastdale",1350,1358],["Wastwater",1377,1386],["England",1519,1526]],"geonouns":[["vale",4,8],["mount",102,107],["head",120,124],["winding",174,181],["paths",182,187],["rocks",196,201],["precipices",206,216],["passes",290,296],["village",309,316],["lake",363,367],["head",399,403],["pass",423,427],["stone",501,506],["mountain",554,562],["crag",615,619],["summit",677,683],["summit",741,747],["crags",887,892],["tarn",924,928],["lake",947,951],["brow",1147,1151],["mountains",1288,1297],["dale",1330,1334],["village",1339,1346],["lake",1369,1373],["mountains",1419,1428],["mountain",1507,1515],["sea",1630,1633]],"pos_words":[["grand",698,703],["finest",1025,1031],["inspire",1086,1093],["delightful",1194,1204],["fertile",1322,1329],["stupendous",1432,1442]],"neg_words":[["torrent",245,252],["rude",447,451],["steep",593,598],["precipitous",603,614],["terror",656,662],["rocky",756,761],["steep",875,880],["awful",1115,1120],["falling",1262,1269]],"events":[],"dates":[["about three quarters",953,973]],"times":[],"distances":[["some miles",278,288],["half a mile",779,790],["a mile",977,983],["3165 feet",1597,1606]],"loc_advs":[["between",188,195],["opposite",1160,1168],["above",1607,1612]],"spa_preps":[["through",159,166],["down",218,222],["through",297,304],["down",646,650],["around",1051,1057],["below",1228,1233],["beyond",1387,1393]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0202702703,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9928976297},{"para_id":269,"paragraph":"But, however charming and extensive the scenery unquestionably is, the idea of its beauty is almost immediately lost in the overpowering sensation of danger, which seizes the mind when contemplating the path to be descended.

It fell upon Grasmer, and after deluging the whole side of the mountain, descended into the plain, and was received by some arable ground. Its violence here first appeared; and it carried before it trees, soil, and gravel, and laid all bare to the naked rock. It seems to have made an immense roll over the next ten acres, which it covered with so vast a bed of stones, that no human art can ever again restore the soil. On the banks of the Lissa, a contracted rivulet, are the vestiges of a stony channel, almost sufficient to contain the waters of the Rhine or the Danube. It was computed, that in many parts the stream must have been five or six yards in depth, and nearly a hundred in breadth; and if we consider the velocity of this great body of water, we shall find its force almost equal to any effect. The village of Brackenthwaite narrowly escaped, by means of the projection of a rock, which resisted the current, and gave it another direction. But its effects on a stone causeway were most surprising, as, from its extraordinary strength and massiveness, this fabric seemed to bid defiance to all external violence. It was of great thickness, and supported on each side by an enormous bank of earth. The memory of man could trace this causeway, unaltered in any particular, for nearly a hundred years: but by the soundness and firmness of its parts and texture, it seemed as if it had stood for ages; and it was almost a doubt whether it were a work of nature or of art. This massy mole the deluge not only carried away; but, as if it turned it into sport, made its very foundations the channel of its own stream.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Brackenthwaite",3,17],["Brackenthwaite",970,984]],"geonouns":[["mountain",207,215],["ground",275,281],["trees",342,347],["rock",398,402],["bed",499,502],["stones",506,512],["banks",572,577],["channel",642,649],["waters",684,690],["stream",759,765],["water",896,901],["force",921,926],["village",959,966],["rock",1035,1039],["stone",1121,1126],["bank",1341,1345],["channel",1743,1750],["stream",1762,1768]],"pos_words":[["immense",429,436],["sufficient",658,668],["great",882,887],["extraordinary",1171,1184],["great",1282,1287],["supported",1303,1312],["soundness",1469,1478],["work",1601,1605]],"neg_words":[["dreadful",64,72],["fell",147,151],["vestiges",622,630],["defiance",1237,1245],["doubt",1577,1582],["deluge",1647,1653]],"events":[],"dates":[["September, 1760",22,37],["nearly a hundred years",1434,1456]],"times":[["five or six",781,792]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",296,300]],"spa_preps":[["into",227,231],["over",442,446],["away",1671,1675],["into",1701,1705]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0130718954,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9933094978},{"para_id":352,"paragraph":"A ride down the vale of Lorton must highly gratify the traveller, who wishes to view nature in her placid features. \" No lakes, no rocks,\" observes Mr. Gilpin,\" are here to blend the ideas of dignity and grandeur with that of beauty.

At another point, mountains extend as far as the eye can reach, declining imperceptibly into distance, and advancing their summits to different heights of elevation; of these the most prominent are Dow Crags, Grisedale Pike, and Helvellyn.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Rydal Head",5,15],["Rydal Hall",55,65],["Grasmere",138,146],["Rydal",151,156],["Elter Water",411,422],["Brathay",487,494],["Windermere",559,569],["Windermere",608,618],["Windermere",839,849],["Esthwaite Water",851,866],["Coniston Lake",929,942],["Furness",987,994],["Crags",1267,1272],["Grisedale Pike",1274,1288],["Helvellyn",1294,1303]],"geonouns":[["mountain",27,35],["country",107,114],["vales",129,134],["wood",187,191],["rock",193,197],["water",203,208],["grounds",247,254],["feet",277,281],["mountains",301,310],["lake",399,403],["water",434,439],["stream",463,469],["lake",600,604],["summit",676,682],["mountain",690,698],["islands",755,762],["promontories",798,810],["horizon",1003,1010],["sea",1029,1032],["shore",1058,1063],["point",1076,1081],["mountains",1083,1092],["summits",1188,1195]],"pos_words":[["pleasant",120,128],["beautifully",158,169],["diversified",170,181],["mighty",552,558],["majestic",591,599],["grandeur",723,731],["right",916,921],["prominent",1249,1258]],"neg_words":[["steep",21,26],["issues",440,446],["rocky",972,977],["declining",1129,1138]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",76,82]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["behind",48,54]],"spa_preps":[["over",513,517],["among",953,958],["into",1153,1157]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0330578512,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987379909},{"para_id":451,"paragraph":"At Rydal Hall are two grand cascades; one in a glen a little above the house, to which a good road has been opened.

The approach to it is through a narrow glen till you come to a little thatched summer-house, which stands on the banks of the river, and which, from the date upon one of its window-shutters, would seem to have been erected in the year 1617. On entering the room of the summer-house, the view of the cascade bursts at once upon the eye. The suddenness and velocity of the impressions which the mind receives, defy every attempt to describe the effect produced on the sensations of the spectator. The momentary effect is electrical. The noise of the torrent, and the dark shade of the overhanging and surrounding trees, form a scene which inspires a variety of pleasing yet melancholy sensations. \" This cascade,\" says Mr. Gilpin,\" though but a miniature, is so beautiful both in itself and its accompaniments, as to deserve a particular notice. It is seen from a summer-house; before which its rocky cheeks, circling on each side, form a little area, appearing through the window like a picture in a frame. The water falls within a few yards of the eye, which being rather above its level, has a long perspective view of the stream, as it hurries from the higher grounds, tumbling in various little breaks through its rocky channel, darkened with thicket, till it arrive at the edge of the precipice, before the window, from whence it rushes into the basin, which is formed by nature in the native rock.\" It is observable, that two streams fall from the clefts of a small shelf of rock; one of which is a broad riband torrent, fretting itself into a white foam; the other is a small rippling stream, whose current disperses as it falls into the basin. The dark colour of the moss-clad rock, taking a still deeper tinge from the wood which hangs over it, shows to great advantage the sparkling lustre of the stream, and produces an uncommon effect of light; for the light, which is denied admittance through the trees, is ushered in at the arch of a small wooden bridge above the falls, and reflected from the surface of the water.

In the woods and in the disposition of the ground round Rydal Hall, there is a charming wildness, that suits the character of the general scene; and wherever art appears, it is with graceful plainness and meek subjection to nature.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Grasmere",335,343],["Legberthwaite",467,480],["Leathes Water",485,498],["Rydal Water",620,631],["Rydal Hall",906,916],["Windermere",1261,1271],["Rydal Hall",1434,1444]],"geonouns":[["lake",6,10],["mountains",58,67],["banks",119,124],["island",140,146],["water",266,271],["road",277,281],["mounts",348,354],["crags",359,364],["mountain",538,546],["banks",611,616],["woods",646,651],["lake",692,696],["valley",726,732],["lake",756,760],["islands",809,816],["trees",841,846],["banks",869,874],["water",892,897],["edge",900,904],["nook",1005,1009],["woods",1021,1026],["summits",1072,1079],["mansion",1152,1159],["groves",1207,1213],["head",1253,1257],["valley",1370,1376],["woods",1385,1390],["ground",1421,1427]],"pos_words":[["clear",18,23],["tranquil",110,118],["remarkable",764,774],["beauty",783,789],["luxuriant",818,827],["elegant",833,840],["finely",924,930],["eminence",937,945],["romantic",996,1004],["majestic",1225,1233],["charming",1457,1465],["graceful",1560,1568]],"neg_words":[["scarcely",159,167],["rude",203,207],["fell",370,374],["ruin",425,429],["rough",1173,1178],["subjection",1588,1598]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile",296,302],["about a mile",737,749],["about two miles",1273,1288]],"loc_advs":[["headlong",49,57],["above",256,261],["there",1446,1451]],"spa_preps":[["near",310,314],["into",405,409],["among",662,667],["above",675,680],["through",710,717],["close",720,725],["round",803,808],["close",990,995],["among",1011,1016],["over",1061,1065],["along",1099,1104],["over",1166,1170],["beyond",1333,1339],["round",1428,1433]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0384615385,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983971715},{"para_id":460,"paragraph":"\" The taste by which a cascade in the pleasure grounds, pouring under the arch of a rude rock, amidst the green tint of woods, is shewn through a darkened garden-house, and, therefore, with all the effect which the opposition of light and shade can give, is even not too artificial; so admirably is the intent accomplished of making all the light that is admitted fall upon the objects which are chiefly meant to be observed.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["grounds",47,54],["rock",89,93],["woods",120,125],["house",162,167],["fall",364,368]],"pos_words":[["pleasure",38,46],["admirably",286,295],["accomplished",310,322]],"neg_words":[["rude",84,88],["darkened",146,154],["opposition",215,225]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["under",64,69],["amidst",95,101],["through",136,143]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.998834312},{"para_id":461,"paragraph":"\" The road to Ambleside runs through the valley in front of Rydal Hall, and, for some distance, among the woods that belong to it, where again the taste of the owner is conspicuous in the disposition of plantations among pastures of extraordinary richness, and where pure rivulets are suffered to wind, without restraint, over their dark rocky channels.

Mr. Clarke, in his survey of this lake, observes, that it contains, below the ferry, two thousand acres, at low water; and, above it, two thousand five hundred and seventy - four acres, including the islands; for which if we deduct forty acres, there remains a sheet of water, comprising four thousand five hundred and thirty - four acres. The breadth of this lake rarely exceeds two miles; near the head it is considerably more than a mile; between this and the islands, which lie nearly in its centre, it is rarely less than a mile; but from the islands, it becomes gradually narrower to Newby Bridge, which lies at its southern extremity. This inequality of width is occasioned partly by the numerous bays with which the shores of this lake are indented, especially on the east or Westmorland side; and partly by the bold crags, which, in some parts of the western or Lancashire side, extend their bases into the water.

Even in the most violent rains, when the country is drenched with water-- when every rill is swollen into a river, and the mountains pour down floods through new channels-- the lake is said to maintain the same equal temper: and though it may spread a few yards over its lower shores( which is the utmost it does), yet it seldom increases so much as to become and object of observation; nor does the severity of the greatest drought occasion any material alteration in its bounds. Once, indeed, it is recorded to have risen seven feet in perpendicular height, in which case its limits would certainly appear enlarged; but, as Mr. Gilpin conjectures, this uncommon rise was probably occasioned by the bursting of a water-spout. But, though it is not perceptibly elevated by rains, this lake is often greatly agitated by winds.

The original rules of St. Bernard partook, in several instances, of the austerities of La Trappe, and the society did not very readily relinquish the milder laws of St. Benedict for the new rigours imposed upon them by the parent monastery of Savigny. They were forbidden to taste flesh, except when ill, and even eggs, butter, cheese, and milk, but on extraordinary occasions; and denied even the use of linen and fur. The monks were divided into two classes, to which separate departments belonged. Those who attended the choir slept upon straw in their usual habits, from which, at midnight, they rose and passed into the church, where they continued their holy hymns, during the short remainder of the night. After this first mass, having publicly confessed themselves, they retired to their cells, and the day was employed in spiritual exercises, and in copying or illuminating manuscripts. An unbroken silence was observed, except when, after dinner, they withdrew into the locutorium, where, for an hour, perhaps, they were permitted the common privilege of social beings. This class was confined to the boundary wall, except that, on some particular days, the members of it were allowed to walk in parties beyond it, for exercise and amusement; but they were very seldom permitted either to receive or pay visits. Like the monks of La Trappe, however, they were distinguished for extensive charities and liberal hospitality; for travellers were so sumptuously entertained at the abbey, that it was not till the dissolution that an inn was thought necessary in this part of Furness, when one was opened for their accommodation, expressly because the monastery could no longer receive them.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[["Savigny",162,169],["Normandy",173,181],["England",402,409],["Savigny",654,661],["Furness",1992,1999]],"geonouns":[["abbey",72,77],["church",1036,1042],["common",1456,1462],["wall",1531,1535],["abbey",1898,1903],["inn",1950,1953]],"pos_words":[["magnificent",60,71],["dedicated",86,95],["readily",538,545],["extraordinary",764,777],["holy",1071,1075],["spiritual",1242,1251],["illuminating",1281,1293],["privilege",1463,1472],["distinguished",1781,1794],["sumptuously",1867,1878]],"neg_words":[["severe",287,293],["dissolution",368,379],["forbidden",673,682],["denied",793,799],["confined",1506,1514],["dissolution",1930,1941]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",1218,1225],["some particular days",1553,1573]],"times":[["midnight",996,1004],["the night",1113,1122],["an hour",1414,1421]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",854,858],["into",1027,1031],["into",1382,1386],["beyond",1625,1631]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0225988701,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9911296368},{"para_id":569,"paragraph":"\" To the second class were assigned the cultivation of the lands and the performance of domestic affairs in the monastery.","file_id":"1819_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["lands",59,64]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9836266637},{"para_id":570,"paragraph":"\" This was the second house in England that received the Bernadine rules, the most rigorous of which were, however, dispensed with in 1485 by Sextus the Fourth, when, among other indulgencies, the whole order was allowed to taste meat on three days of the week.
