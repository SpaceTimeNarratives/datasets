In Queen Elizabeth's time the inhabitants of Colton and Hawkshead fells remonstrated against the number of bloomeries then in the country, because they consumed all the loppings and croppings, the sole winter food for their cattle. The people agreed to pay to the Queen the rent received from these works, on condition they were suppressed. These rents now called Bloom Smithy, are paid to the crown to this day, notwithstanding the improved state of the country has rendered the use of the former indulgence needless.","file_id":"1776_b","plnames":[["Elizabeth",206,215],["Colton",242,248],["Hawkshead",253,262]],"geonouns":[["trees",37,42],["country",327,334],["country",652,659]],"pos_words":[["tops",17,21],["works",496,501],["improved",630,638],["indulgence",695,705]],"neg_words":[["decline",145,152],["needless",706,714]],"events":[],"dates":[["Autumn",111,117],["winter",399,405],["this day",600,608]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["against",282,289]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0333333333,"vader_sentiment":0.81,"roberta_sentiment":0.9167856574},{"para_id":50,"paragraph":"Keep by the side of the River Crake; near its discharge from Coninston mere at a place called Waterfoot, lay abundance of slate brought down by water from the quarries in the fells; observed also great heaps of birch besoms, which are also articles for exportation.","file_id":"1776_b","plnames":[["River Crake",24,35],["Coninston",61,70],["Waterfoot",94,103]],"geonouns":[["mere",71,75],["water",144,149],["quarries",159,167]],"pos_words":[["abundance",109,118],["great",196,201]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["near",37,41],["down",136,140]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0740740741,"vader_sentiment":0.62,"roberta_sentiment":0.9965040684},{"para_id":51,"paragraph":"Reach Coninston or Thurstain water, a beautiful lake, about seven measured miles long; and the greatest breadth three quarters: the greatest depth from thirty to forty fathoms.
