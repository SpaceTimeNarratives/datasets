For, living a solitary life in the isle of that great and extended lake, from whence proceeds the river of Derwent, he used to visit Saint Cuthbert every year, to receive from his lips the doctrine of eternal life. When this holy priest heard of Saint Cuthbert's coming to Lugubalia, he came after his usual manner, desiring to be comforted more and more with the hopes of everlasting bliss by his divine exhortations. As they sate together, and enjoyed the hopes of heaven, among other things the bishop said,' Remember, brother Herberte, that whatsoever ye have to say and ask of me, you do it now, for after we depart hence, we shall not meet again, and see one another corporally in this world; for I know well the time of my dissolution is at hand, and the laying aside of this earthly tabernacle draweth on apace.' When Herberte heard this, he fell down at his feet, and with many sighs and tears beseeched him, for the love of the Lord, that he would not forsake him, but to remember his faithful brother and associate, and make intercession with the gracious God, that they might depart hence into heaven together, to behold His grace and glory, whom they had in unity of spirit served on earth. ' For you know I have ever studied and laboured to live according to your pious and virtuous instructions; and in whatsoever I offended or omitted, through ignorance and frailty, I straightway used my earnest efforts to amend after your ghostly counsel, will, and judgment.' At this earnest and affectionate request of Herberte's, the bishop went to prayer, and presently being certified in spirit that his petition to heaven would be granted,--' Arise,' saith he,' my dear brother, weep not, but let your rejoicing be with exceeding gladness; for the great mercy of God hath granted unto us our prayer.' The truth of which promise and prophecy was well proved in that which ensued; for their separation was the last that befel them on earth: on the same day, which was the 19th day of March, their souls departed from their bodies, and were straight in union in the beatific sight and vision; and were transported hence to the kingdom of heaven, by the service and hands of angels.\"","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[["Cuthbert",165,173],["Isle",182,186],["Derwent",341,348],["Cuthbert",373,381],["Cuthbert",486,494],["Lugubalia",507,516]],"geonouns":[["isle",269,273],["lake",301,305],["river",332,337],["fell",1084,1088],["feet",1101,1105]],"pos_words":[["perfect",62,69],["spiritual",203,212],["love",213,217],["great",282,287],["holy",459,463],["desiring",550,558],["everlasting",607,618],["bliss",619,624],["divine",632,638],["enjoyed",680,687],["heaven",701,707],["well",944,948],["love",1160,1164],["faithful",1229,1237],["gracious",1292,1300],["heaven",1340,1346],["grace",1371,1376],["glory",1381,1386],["unity",1405,1410],["virtuous",1522,1530],["earnest",1639,1646],["earnest",1721,1728],["affectionate",1733,1745],["heaven",1857,1863],["rejoicing",1944,1953],["exceeding",1962,1971],["gladness",1972,1980],["great",1990,1995],["mercy",1996,2001],["promise",2062,2069],["well",2087,2091],["heaven",2377,2383]],"neg_words":[["dissolution",964,975],["forsake",1196,1203],["ignorance",1594,1603],["weep",1921,1925]],"events":[],"dates":[["every year",382,392],["the same day",2184,2196],["the 19th day of March",2208,2229]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["together",666,674],["among",709,714],["aside",1003,1008],["down",1089,1093],["into",1335,1339],["together",1347,1355],["through",1586,1593]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1296296296,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9970906973},{"para_id":308,"paragraph":"Stanza 18, line 6.","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["line",11,15]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["18",7,9],["6.",16,18]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.984595418},{"para_id":309,"paragraph":"\" Rears her myrtle bower.\"","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9672586918},{"para_id":310,"paragraph":"The Ggale, or Dutch myrtle, grows in great profusion in the neighbourhood of this lake.","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["lake",82,86]],"pos_words":[["great",37,42],["profusion",43,52]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.25,"vader_sentiment":0.62,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984117746},{"para_id":311,"paragraph":"Stanza 32, line 9.","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["line",11,15]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["32",7,9],["9",16,17]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9807079434},{"para_id":312,"paragraph":"\" The hallowed Pix received.\"","file_id":"1832_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["hallowed",6,14]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.2,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9956011772},{"para_id":313,"paragraph":"The pix was a box, or dove, of goldsmith's work, which contained the host.
