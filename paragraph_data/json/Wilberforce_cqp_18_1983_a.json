It is very pleasant Riding, since you are more at Liberty to look about you and less at the Road than you generally are the North Country,&amp; nowhere is there where it answers better to gaze with all your Eyes about you. The Day brightened by degrees into a most charming one, but the Sun shone too bright to make distant objects so clear as I have sometimes known them. West's account of the Ride is a very good one. Ingleborough accompanies you to the Right for many miles, but when you see the Cumberland hills\" in rude confusion hurled\" its beauty becomes conspicuous not its sublimity. Get a Guide close to the Sands who will tell you the names of the Mountains. The sudden break into Westmoreland is wonderfully grand. At Holker is a seat of Lord G. Cavendish, who has a large Estate in the neighborhood. The People get Peats from the sides of the Hills. You come into a Theatre of them which looking wild&amp; rude have a fine Effect. Tell the Guide to go through Holker or he will carry you a different way. There is an immense Quantity of Wood on Lord G's Estates, and the descent upon the Sands after you have ridden through the Woods is very fine. You see at a great distance some most majestic Hills&amp; close to you is on the Right a great Bay dry at Low Water which gives you a View of the country replete with the Sublime&amp; beautiful. If you be in a Chaise look behind you when you are about \u00bc of a Mile from the Gate which goes upon the Sands. You will see the most majestic trees growing close to the Sands,&amp; it must be delightful to walk under their cover when the Sea is up. The whole ride is a most delightful one to Ulverston; you leave the Sands 3 miles from it. A little before we left them the Tide was coming in a yard high at a great distance&amp; the Sun shining upon it shewed like a Range of Diamonds. It has a curious appearance to see large Ships upon the dry Sand which are entirely left at low water many miles. You see on the sands many Rocks which render the navigation very dangerous. On your left the woods of Conishead Priory are visible. Upon the whole, with the natural beauties of the Country, the fineness of the day and the lively air received from the Crowds of young men&amp; maidens hurrying to&amp; from Ulverston( pronounced Ouston) market the scene was the most delightful one I ever beheld. The Town a great one. The Inn crowded brim full of people. The land hereabouts frequently lets from about 15s. to 25s. an acre, for rather more near Hornby. From Ulverston to Ambleside 21 miles by Lowick Bridge&amp; the edge of Hawkshead-- you ride for 6 miles by the side of Coniston Lake and the Mountains at the Head of it are all wonderfully sublime. You then mount a steep Hill, when turn to have a view of the Lake, rather before West directs you.

Went up Cockshut Hill whence, the day being dark, the Lake did not appear to great advantage, neither is the Station so good as some others.

It wants but a bend&amp; swell at the end as that would besides its natural Beauty give one the Idea of its washing the far distant Hills, which are indistinctly seen beyond it.

The best way of going up is by the Way which they bring the Slate, to which anyone at Grange will direct you, a very good walking way. The View from it was the most striking I saw at Keswick. An immense Rock on your Left, another near as high on your Right look like Giants to support Castle Hill the Champion of Borrodale. From it you see under you a beautiful little Vale, watered by the River( which though in some parts beautifully winding is hardly large enough for the Purpose).
