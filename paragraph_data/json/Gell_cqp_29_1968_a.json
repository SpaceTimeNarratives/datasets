The first of this family who appears to have been mentioned in history, was Sir Nicholas Radcliffe of Dilston in the County of NorthumberlandKnight, in the time of Edward the first, whose descendant married the heiress of the Derwentwaters in the time of Henry the Sixth, and through her obtained this princely estate. Francis first Earl of Derwentwater his lineal descendant, became Baron Dilston Viscount Langley and Radcliff and Earl of Derwentwater in the time of King Jamesthe second, but his son adhering to the unfortunate family of Stewart, on their attempt to recover the throne in the year 1716, lost at once his titles estate and life. It is I believe certain that his brother left issue abroad, as to himself, coming over in the late unfortunate and unsuccessful struggleof Prince Charles in the year forty five, he was seized and convicted upon his former attainder, without any enquiry as to his conduct on the latter occasion, but merelyas to the assist-ance he gave to his Brother in 1716. it is the belief of the vulgar that some years ago a young man of genteel appear-ance came to see this Lake, witha friend who acted as interpreter, as he himself could not speak English. They enquired for an old man in Keswick, who served them as a guide, and desired to see all thatever belonged to the Derwentwater family, he took them upon one of the neigh-bouring hills and pointed out to them as accurately as he was able every part of the Estatewhich lay before them, the young man burst into tears. Afterwards having hand-somely rewarded his conductor he turned away from the scene and quitted the kingdom immediately. He is suppos-ed to have been of the Radcliff family, and probably from the younger brother of the attainted Earl before mentioned. Camden says this family had ancientlya castle at Castle Rigg and adds that the fine old oaks which surrounded the mansion were cut down by the trustees of the Greenwich hospital to the maintenance of which the forfeited estate was applied. The presentrepresentative in England re-ceives at present no more that two thousand five hundreds pounds annually, although the estate amounts to more than 20,000, and it is remarkablethat of the Fraser's and others who were concerned at the same time with Ld Derwentwater every one has had their property restored except his family. Pocklingtons Islandis like all which formerly belonged to the Radcliff's let upon long leases to the different tennants. The taste of Mr. Pocklington in buildings anddecorations, is so remarkable that I cannot omit to mention a few of his singularities. On making the foundation for his cellars and house at theisland, was found a great stone, this, though the Architect wished it to remain, as an excellent foundation, he resolved to fix up-right before his house and at a greatexpence had is placed there. A druid temple was the next thing to employ his genius and accordingly he collected a number of large stones, placed them in a circle, and hadthem fixed upright on the southern shore. Unfortunately for all the lovers of British antiquity a storm arose in the lake, and the waves washed down in one night the labours of some days. On the other side a venerable whitewashed gothic building rears its august head, in all the pride of pasteboard antiquity. A church, Faro batteries and four or five cannon painted white make up the whole of this miraculous assemblage of beauties, and surround the enchanted island, I say enchant-ed for tis plain nature never formed in her most sportive moments, such an awkward jumble of gantastic gew gaws.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Crag",21,25],["Derwentwater",136,148],["Dilston",288,295],["Derwentwater",527,539],["Dilston",576,583],["Derwentwater",626,638],["Keswick",1411,1418],["Derwentwater",1496,1508],["Castle",1998,2004],["Greenwich",2108,2117],["England",2218,2225],["Derwentwater",2449,2461]],"geonouns":[["island",32,38],["island",51,57],["residence",99,108],["lake",180,184],["hills",1560,1565],["castle",1988,1994],["mansion",2063,2070],["buildings",2676,2685],["house",2822,2827],["stone",2860,2865],["house",2982,2987],["stones",3133,3139],["shore",3208,3213],["lake",3290,3294],["building",3410,3418],["head",3436,3440],["church",3486,3492],["island",3635,3641]],"pos_words":[["recover",755,762],["accurately",1593,1603],["fine",2028,2032],["restored",2495,2503],["like",2545,2549],["remarkable",2708,2718],["great",2854,2859],["excellent",2921,2930],["right",2965,2970],["genius",3079,3085],["pride",3453,3458],["miraculous",3573,3583],["enchanted",3625,3634],["enchant",3649,3656]],"neg_words":[["unfortunate",704,715],["lost",792,796],["issue",879,884],["unfortunate",932,943],["unsuccessful",948,960],["vulgar",1216,1222],["concerned",2414,2423],["omit",2733,2737],["awkward",3732,3739]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year 1716",777,790],["the year forty five",990,1009],["1716",1186,1190],["some years ago",1228,1242],["annually",2294,2302],["some days",3350,3359],["august",3429,3435]],"times":[["The first",186,195],["one night",3325,3334]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",874,878],["abroad",885,891],["without",1066,1073],["there",3024,3029],["upright",3184,3191]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",8,16],["through",462,469],["over",915,919],["out",1578,1581],["into",1686,1690],["away",1761,1765],["down",2080,2084],["down",3317,3321]],"normalised_sentiment":0.015015015,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961565137},{"para_id":23,"paragraph":"He has just sold this spot to Mr. Peachy and means to retire to Barrow cascade hal, where if possible he has outdone himself in ridiculous fancies.

A few trifling slips gave us warning of what we had to expect without care, and we afterwards heard that a guide from Keswick had broken his leg there, almost a year before we visited the spot.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Rosthwaite",40,50],["Dovedale",174,182],["Keswick",1172,1179]],"geonouns":[["village",29,36],["hill",79,83],["country",237,244],["hills",250,255],["rocks",273,278],["valley",287,293],["valley",557,563],["crags",598,603],["rock",653,657],["road",884,888],["country",947,954]],"pos_words":[["romantic",216,224],["transparent",298,309],["worthy",330,336],["great",787,792],["overtake",863,871]],"neg_words":[["steep",73,78],["darkness",845,853],["stumble",985,992],["warning",1083,1090],["broken",1184,1190]],"events":[],"dates":[["one quarter",759,770],["almost a year",1206,1219]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",188,192],["without",1116,1123],["there",1199,1204]],"spa_preps":[["down",545,549],["below",624,629],["over",993,997]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.913991034},{"para_id":29,"paragraph":"A short time before we arrived at the top of the fell the road became nothing more than a morass, and it is curious to relate that a dispute ensued, whether a loose line of stones on which we stood was intended for a road or the bed of a torrent at the time when a considerable fall of rain, or the dissolution of winter snows, produces frequent floods in this mountainous region. At length we saw buttermere; at the head of the lake stand two or three houses, called Gatesgarth, where we learnt from a man who answered our question from his bed, that we only wanted two miles of the village. We entered the village at eleven, and at the door of the inn, known only by the name of Joseph Robinsons, for there is no sign, we were received by the landlords daughter, the celebrated beauty of those parts.

Not far from the tenth mile stone we turned to the left through the small village of Penruddock to Graystock castle which we judged to be about four miles from the turnpike road. While our eggs and bacon were preparing at a small house in Graystock we walked to the castle situated in a park well stocked with deer and the property of the Duke of Norfolk, it is perhaps one of the most retired situations in the kingdom.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Ullswater",30,39],["Dacre",72,77],["Penrith",337,344],["St. John",385,393],["Penruddock",637,647],["Graystock",651,660],["Graystock",791,800]],"geonouns":[["stone",138,143],["stones",217,223],["road",345,349],["vale",377,381],["stone",580,585],["village",626,633],["castle",661,667],["turnpike",716,724],["road",725,729],["house",782,787],["castle",818,824],["park",839,843]],"pos_words":[["right",172,177],["worthy",425,431],["well",844,848]],"neg_words":[["hedge",159,164],["slowly",498,504]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the morning",3,14]],"distances":[["the first mile",123,137],["more than eight feet",242,262],["eight miles",528,539],["the tenth mile",565,579],["about four miles",690,706]],"loc_advs":[["left",603,607]],"spa_preps":[["out",22,25],["over",151,155],["through",365,372],["through",608,615]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0113636364,"vader_sentiment":0.13,"roberta_sentiment":0.5210114121},{"para_id":41,"paragraph":"The dutchess has resided here for more than three years and seldom stirs from the walls of the castle. The present building is neither new nor is it the ancient castle but was by the appearance probably erected about the begginning of the present century. The rooms are not large and seem but half finished an handsome oak staircase conducts you to the upper story where on seeing dust curtains hanging from the top of the room, we expected to have found some of the richly worked hangings usually concealed behind them, but I believe our surprize was very visible to the housekeeper who pulling the cover aside discovered nothing but a common cotton bed in the new style from which we immediately turned. There is one of blue velvet with silver in an adjoining room, the embroidery no doubt executed by some of the noble ladies of the Howard family, this has no cover, though for richness it far surpasses the others and must have cost ten times the sum, at the time it was made. The front of this building represented in Grose, and in a set of engravings by Byrne has been taken down by the present duke. Leaving Graystock we proceeded to Dacre Castle once the seat of the Dacre family who had great possessions in the north. Dumbrough Castle and Burgh belonged to them. The last given by one of the earls of Chester to Robt. de Trivers from whom it came to the Morvilles one of whom forfeited it by the murder of Thos a Becket in 1170 as well as his castle of Brougham. Brougham is about three miles from Penrith and I sincerely regret that our time did not permit us to see the notable ruins. In the time of the conqueror it belonged to Hugo de Albinois from the Morvilles the Viponts succeeded to it in whose time part was demolished. The famous Countess of Pembroke once possessed it and during a visit here a great part of the Arcadia of Sir Philip Sydney was written. With respect to the Dacre family all that I can at present recollect is that by the marriage of Ranulph Lord Dacre with Maud, daughter and heir of one of the Multons which family had the representatives of the Morvilles and Vaulx's of Gillesland the title of Gillesland and the great possessions of the three families came to the Dacres. There were two families one called Dacre of the north and th other of Gillesland.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Graystock",1115,1124],["Dacre Castle",1141,1153],["Dacre",1175,1180],["Castle",1238,1244],["Chester",1311,1318],["Brougham",1463,1471],["Brougham",1473,1481],["Penrith",1508,1515],["Dacre",1896,1901],["Dacre",1985,1990],["Dacre",2249,2254]],"geonouns":[["walls",82,87],["castle",95,101],["building",115,123],["castle",161,167],["common",637,643],["bed",651,654],["building",999,1007],["seat",1163,1167],["castle",1453,1459]],"pos_words":[["handsome",310,318],["top",412,415],["richly",467,473],["worked",474,480],["noble",816,821],["richness",881,889],["great",1196,1201],["well",1441,1445],["sincerely",1522,1531],["succeeded",1689,1698],["famous",1744,1750],["great",1816,1821],["respect",1881,1888],["great",2154,2159]],"neg_words":[["dust",381,385],["doubt",786,791],["murder",1406,1412],["regret",1532,1538],["ruins",1590,1595]],"events":[],"dates":[["more than three years",34,55],["the present century",235,254],["1170",1433,1437]],"times":[["The last",1273,1281]],"distances":[["about three miles",1485,1502]],"loc_advs":[["here",25,29],["here",1809,1813]],"spa_preps":[["about",211,216],["behind",508,514],["aside",606,611],["down",1081,1085]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0441176471,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973342419},{"para_id":42,"paragraph":"The part which now remains, I conjecture to have been no more than the keep of the ancient castle. It is at present the property of the Hassels of Dalemain about two miles distant. We had a view of it from the towers of Dacre. Dalemain was anciently part of the barony of Graystock and held as Camden says of that lordship in cornage. We found the people at the castle civil and obliging and they gave us milk, and one of the fairest married women in the kingdom, conducted us to the top of the building through a narrow stone staircase. From hence we walked perhaps two miles, to Pooley bridge in our way passing by one side of the hill Dunmallet, till we arrived at the side of Ulleswater where some fishermen who said they belonged to the duke of Norfolk sold us three pounds of their trout and Grayling which we carried to the inn and dressed for supper. There are two public housess in the village, we found at Prichardsons a very decent lodging. We were now on the... side of Dunmallet and with some difficulty ascended to its summit, not on account of its height but the steepness of the path. This hill is situated exactly at the lower end of Ulleswater and on one side the... takes its course from the lake on the other the... The view from the summit was beautiful, the scenery round the lake was as rich as a fine sheet of water and woods and fruitful enclosures down to the waters edge could make it. There was formerly a roman station here, and since the conquest a Benedictine nunnery which once ornamented its brow, must have been a happy and picturesque conclusion to a sail down the lake. Indeed it is not a little surprising that more of these religious houses are not to be found on these lakes, than which no place could be more suited to the idea of monkish solitude nor could the ruined tower and pointed arch, embosomed in ivy, be found in a place more beautifully calculated to inspire veneration or add thought on other times with greater effect than here. The next morning we set out from Pooley bridge along the side of the lake for Patterdale. The road lies scarcely two hundred yards from the water, the whole of the way indeed till we got near the village of Wattermillock we never left the shore, and in Gowbarrow park the road is washed all the way by the lake on the left. We admired the situation of Mr. Robinsons house much, situated among trees and commanding a view of two reaches of the lake which here turns to the west having before spread from north west to south east. The sun shone with all its splendour when we reached the gate of Gowbarrow park, and we sat down by a little rivulet to rest ourselves, for five minutes, the cattle were cooling themselves, in the water, the lake became gently agitated, and the thick woods in the park were a fine contrast to the naked barrenness of the opposite rock. As we proceeded we saw three gentlemen whom we had before met at Grassmere, they were fishing from a boat, they acknowledged us, and informed us how far we were distant from Lyulph's tower which was they our object.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Dalemain",147,155],["Dacre",220,225],["Dalemain",227,235],["Graystock",272,281],["Dunmallet",638,647],["Ulleswater",680,690],["Dunmallet",982,991],["Ulleswater",1151,1161],["Patterdale",2060,2070],["Grassmere",2912,2921]],"geonouns":[["castle",91,97],["towers",210,216],["castle",362,368],["top",484,487],["building",495,503],["stone",521,526],["bridge",588,594],["hill",633,637],["inn",831,834],["village",895,902],["summit",1033,1039],["path",1095,1099],["hill",1106,1110],["lake",1211,1215],["summit",1254,1260],["lake",1298,1302],["water",1334,1339],["woods",1344,1349],["waters",1386,1392],["edge",1393,1397],["station",1440,1447],["brow",1525,1529],["lake",1600,1604],["houses",1672,1678],["lakes",1708,1713],["tower",1809,1814],["bridge",2022,2028],["lake",2051,2055],["road",2076,2080],["water",2122,2127],["village",2178,2185],["shore",2221,2226],["park",2245,2249],["road",2254,2258],["lake",2288,2292],["house",2348,2353],["trees",2375,2380],["lake",2425,2429],["gate",2568,2572],["park",2586,2590],["water",2708,2713],["lake",2719,2723],["woods",2762,2767],["park",2775,2779],["rock",2841,2845],["boat",2948,2952],["tower",3030,3035]],"pos_words":[["decent",936,942],["beautiful",1265,1274],["rich",1310,1314],["fruitful",1354,1362],["happy",1548,1553],["picturesque",1558,1569],["beautifully",1876,1887],["inspire",1902,1909]],"neg_words":[["difficulty",1006,1016],["ruined",1802,1808],["lies",2081,2085],["scarcely",2086,2094],["object",3055,3061]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",1318,1324],["a fine",2785,2791]],"times":[["The next morning",1982,1998],["five minutes",2651,2663]],"distances":[["about two miles",156,171],["two miles",567,576]],"loc_advs":[["here",1448,1452],["here",1976,1980],["left",2212,2216],["left",2300,2304],["here",2436,2440]],"spa_preps":[["through",504,511],["round",1288,1293],["down",1374,1378],["down",1591,1595],["out",2006,2009],["along",2029,2034],["near",2169,2173],["among",2369,2374],["down",2603,2607],["opposite",2832,2840]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0109489051,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9922419786},{"para_id":43,"paragraph":"In a short time we saw the turrets peeping over the trees in which they are so concealed that we had very nearly passed the building before we looked up through the trees and discovered our mistake. We knocked at the door a woman desired us to enter who showed us the inside of the tower consisting of a servants hall a long hall within used as a dining room and beyond a staircase. On the other side the door we entered, was the room belonging to the family who live there. Upstairs we had good views of the lake from the windows of the turrets. The whole is nothing more than a farm house or a gamekeepers lodge where the Duke of Norfolk to whom the park and parts of the lake belong has two or three rooms for an occasional fishing or shooting party. The outside nearest to the lake is built of rough stones, the angles are turretted, and though from the form of the battlements and the shape of the windows, the frames of which as well as the doors are painted of a delightful pea green, the place can never be mistaken for an old building, yet at a distance where these little defects are not observed, the whole has an effect that does honour to the taste of the owner. A very civil fellow who we took to be the gamekeeper coming in and observing us rather warm from our walk insisted on our tasting some rum and new milk which he immediately mixed and presented to us.

On the right is a large sweep of the lake adorned with three rocky islands. Their names are House holm, wall island and Cherry holm, behind them is a rocky and wild assemblage of hills and the beautiful village of Patterdale closes the scene. On the left are the woods of Gowbarrow and the park. Lyulph's tower looks nobly from an eminence on the water, over topped by hanging woods that terminate once only by a promontory which hides the remaining part of the park from the view. Beyond this are other woods, and fields and hills in the distance, the whole is finished by the Stainmore hills in the horizon which compleat the sweetest landscape in the lakes. From this charming view we passed on the St. Patricks well, which gives name to the valley, there is anually a ceremony observed here on St. Patricks day of drinking a bottle of rum over the spring and on that day dancing and all sorts of merriment go on with great spirit, in honour of the tutelary Saint of this beautiful spot. We dined at the Kings Arms at the head of the lake, the people are very civil and gave us a very good dinner, after which we set out for Grassmere. We passed again by the church, in the yard is an yew tree nine yards in circumference. The way is one of the most fatiguing that can be conceived running long the side of Grisdale beck for no less than six miles of which at the least four miles and a half are up a steep fell. We were not a little pleased with the sight of Grisedale tarn, a small piece of water about three miles from Grassmere where we had been on fishing parties before. From thence the road or rather the track, lies all down hill to Grassmere and we found ourselves so thirsty from our long walk up the hill that a little well we met with would have suffered greatly from our attack if prudence had not restrained us in some measure. At this well there is a report that the old King of Patterdale once emptied an whole bottle of Rum, when on a fishing party the company were not provided with glasses. Of this Gentleman I forgot to mention that he was called king of Patterdale by hereditary right, having inherited from his ancestors an estate in the valley, upwards of two hundred pounds a year which from the remoteness of the situation is said never to have paid taxes, been disturbed by the rapacity of tyrants or plundered by the incursions of the Scots. His late majesty lived to a great age. Her majesty is yet living, and is reported to have lately given up drinking, to which she has formerly been immoderately attached. The family name is Mounsey, and the present King with a fortune of eight hundred a year, which was partly scraped up by the penurious father, has the character of a gentleman of the most benevolent and charitable disposition. We arrived at Grassmere in the evening where we found another of our party waiting for our return. As he had never seen Keswick or Buttermere he crossed over the fells of Borrowdale to the latter. Two of our former party went with him. As to myself being not much attracted by the charms of Grassmere I went with my only remaining companion to Keswick intending to remains there till the return of the Buttermere party. We took a walk to friar crag, a favourite situation for viewing the Lake. Some ladies bathing at a distance, certainly more for health than pleasure for it blew a storm might have put me in mind of mermaids or Niads had not the wind been so cold as to chill every effort of the imagination and a shower of rain forced us to retreat to our inn. I this morning walked about three miles and \u00bd to Lowdore as I saw from friar crag it did not want water. I cannot say I was much astonished at the fall, after having seen scale force. Indeed it is no where properly speaking a fall, for there is no part of it where the stream falls two feet perpendicularly but the whole rushes down a bed of rocks, which are not inclined more than five and forty degrees from the horizon. I cannot think after the wonders that are related of it, that it is ever in perfection during the summer, for among other things the people say the noise can be heard at Ouse bridge at least ten miles in a direct line from the fall.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Patterdale",74,84],["Patterdale",408,418],["Grassmere",1322,1331],["Grisdale",1504,1512],["Grisedale",1657,1666],["Grassmere",1719,1728],["Grassmere",1838,1847],["Patterdale",2091,2101],["Patterdale",2272,2282],["Grassmere",2976,2985],["Keswick",3082,3089],["Buttermere",3093,3103],["Borrowdale",3133,3143],["Grassmere",3253,3262],["Keswick",3306,3313],["Buttermere",3364,3374],["Lowdore",3775,3782]],"geonouns":[["road",4,8],["trees",46,51],["park",103,107],["gate",108,112],["lakes",187,192],["lake",231,235],["islands",261,268],["wall",298,302],["island",303,309],["hills",373,378],["village",397,404],["woods",457,462],["park",484,488],["tower",499,504],["water",541,546],["woods",571,576],["promontory",607,617],["park",656,660],["woods",698,703],["fields",709,715],["hills",720,725],["hills",782,787],["horizon",795,802],["landscape",831,840],["lakes",848,853],["valley",939,945],["head",1219,1223],["lake",1231,1235],["church",1356,1362],["tree",1386,1390],["beck",1513,1517],["tarn",1667,1671],["water",1690,1695],["road",1790,1794],["track",1809,1814],["hill",1830,1834],["hill",1908,1912],["valley",2357,2363],["crag",3406,3410],["inn",3721,3724],["crag",3803,3807],["water",3824,3829],["force",3903,3908],["stream",3995,4001],["bed",4061,4064],["rocks",4068,4073],["horizon",4140,4147],["bridge",4324,4330],["line",4362,4366]],"pos_words":[["finest",133,139],["right",201,206],["beautiful",387,396],["nobly",511,516],["eminence",525,533],["charming",865,873],["well",909,913],["merriment",1094,1103],["great",1115,1120],["beautiful",1169,1178],["good",1282,1286],["pleased",1631,1638],["well",1927,1931],["prudence",1991,1999],["well",2047,2051],["right",2297,2302],["majesty",2575,2582],["great",2594,2599],["majesty",2609,2616],["fortune",2792,2799],["benevolent",2923,2933],["charitable",2938,2948],["pleasure",3522,3530],["astonished",3855,3865],["properly",3932,3940],["wonders",4174,4181],["perfection",4225,4235]],"neg_words":[["rocky",255,260],["rocky",344,349],["wild",354,358],["steep",1598,1603],["fell",1604,1608],["lies",1816,1820],["suffered",1955,1963],["attack",1981,1987],["disturbed",2484,2493],["immoderately",2713,2725],["cold",3623,3627],["chill",3634,3639],["retreat",3706,3713],["fall",3952,3956],["falls",4002,4007],["noise",4297,4302]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",1005,1008],["the spring",1042,1052],["that day",1060,1068],["a year",2395,2401],["a year",2817,2823],["\u00bd",3770,3771],["the fall",3869,3877],["forty",4117,4122],["the summer",4243,4253],["the fall",4372,4380]],"times":[["the evening",2989,3000],["this morning",3728,3740]],"distances":[["no less than six miles",1522,1544],["four miles and a half",1567,1588],["about three miles",1696,1713],["about three miles",3748,3765],["two feet",4008,4016],["at least ten miles",4331,4349]],"loc_advs":[["past",94,98],["there",113,118],["left",444,448],["there",947,952],["here",984,988],["there",2052,2057],["upwards",2365,2372],["there",3335,3340],["there",3962,3967]],"spa_preps":[["under",19,24],["among",177,182],["behind",327,333],["over",548,552],["over",1037,1041],["out",1314,1317],["down",1825,1829],["over",3115,3119],["down",4054,4058],["among",4259,4264]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0285714286,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987509251},{"para_id":46,"paragraph":"Bassenthwaite has little beauty when compared to Derwent there is not one island on the lake it is no where a mile in breadth and the hills except Skiddow are comparatively nothing.

The morning after I climbed Skiddow beginning my ascent from the upper end of Bassenthwaite. I cannot say I was so much pleased at the views from its summit as I expected from the accounts of others. The weather was foggy when I began to ascend but before I reached the top, the sun shone and I had an opportunity of seeing all beneath me. That part of Derwentwater which I saw, looked mean from such an height and Bassenthwaite was narrow. Solway firth and the opposite shore of Scotland, on the one hand, and the Isle of Man on the other were seen indistinctly through the blue vapour in which they appeared to be enveloped. I descended by the base of Latrigg a smaller hill often called Skiddow's cub and gained the Penrith road about half a mile from Keswick passing over a wooden bridge raised on high rafters which joins the opposite sides of the Greeta. When I arrived at the Inn I found two of our party returned from Buttermere in company with whom I went the next morning on the lake for the second time. We touched at Lords island and compared a plan I had procured of the old house there with the ruined foundations. The island is far greater in size than Vicars, the trees flourish greatly. It is reported that when the trustees of the Greenwich hospital planted the island with young trees there were such numbers of mice on the place that the trees were soon demolished. To remedy this, numbers of cats were turned loose upon the shore who lessened their numbers so considerably that they themselves had not enough for their subsistence. Some few were adventurous enough to tempt the waves and gained the nearest land others died on the island and some few remained long in their undisturbed retirement. Our next object was Barrow cascade the fall was really grand and the walks not ill suited to the place, a most unusual circumstance where Mr. Pocklington is concerned.

I sincerely wish Mr. Pocklington had been more attached to the amusement of sailing, than that of building, indeed the defficiency of sailing boats on the lakes can not fail to strike ever observed to a painter there must be great and striking defect in point of picturesque beauty.

Several vessels were anchored along the shore and they added much to the lively appearance of this beautiful and extensive lake. We arrived at Kendal about six in the evening, and saw there a miserable museum a most wretched imitation of Crossthwaites. We ascended to the castle once the residence of the Lancasters Barons of Kendal one of the first families in the country and connected with the Atons Vesu Taillebois and Tysons of Alnwick. Nothing more than a small part of the shell remains. The town is neat, in the Church are monuments of the Stricklands of Sizergh; Parrs of Kendal and Bellinghams. In the morning of the 27th we set off for Milnthrop passing in our way the hall at Sizergh, not long since a venerable mansion, now in conformity to the custom of the country daubed with whitewash or plaister, so as to have lost much of its former respectable appearance. There is a tower here, built in the time of Henry the 3rd or Edward the first by William Strickland Knight, who married Elizabeth the heiress of Ralph Lord Deincourt about that time. This I cannot say I particularly observed as we had not time to see the house. There are several specimens of oak carving in the hosue as we heard, they were executed under the direction of Walker Strickland in the time of Elizabeth or James the first. We soon after arrived at Levens, the ancient and respectable seat of the Levens family, from whom this place descended to the Redman's from them to the Bellinghams and afterwards to the Graham's. An heiress of Graham brought this seat to the Suffolk family and the countess of Andover is the present possessor. We entered in front. An old hall floored with black oak presented itself, the wainscoat reached about two thirds of the height, above were the arms of Bellingham quartered with another coat all round the room. The ceiling was covered with plaister mouldings, over the chimney place hung two or three frames containing the genealogy of the family, in another frame I observed a copy of the Ely roll which was drawn in the time of the conqueror. Under the staircase is a place used as a chapel, above are many lodging rooms. In one is a handsome state bed at least it has formerly been so. From the hall a few steps on the left hand conduct you to an handsome apartment, in the windows of which are the arms of the Bellinghams and their matches are painted. In this room are some of the oak carvings, mentioned by West, as placed here by James Bellingham to imitate the taste of his neighbour Walter Strickland of Sizergh, but if the carvings at Sizergh, be neither superior, or in greater profusion than here, this is only another instance of the fallacy or Mr. Wests eyesight, who must have possessed a peculiar faculty of magnifying and multiplying whatever came in his way. The River Kent runs through the park where it falls near twenty feet. There is much fine timber on the estate and nothing is spoiled by any modern alteration, except the house which is whitewashed all over on the outside. The garden preserves the same form as it received from a gardener of King James the firsts, who says West, eresided here with the colonel Graham during part of the troubles of his royal master,' Its peculiarity consists in clipped yew trees or cypresses, which distinguish the terraces and gardens of that time, it is laid out in small formal beds bordered with box; the walks are of turf. We dined at Milnthrop seven miles from Kendal and after dinner went to enquire for the captain of a vessel to whom we had been recommended by a Gentleman of Kendal. We found him at work in his hay field and he informed us that he meant to sail on the 29th to Liverpool. We returned to Milnthrop to procure provisions, and settle with our Landlady there, and the next morning returned to Mr. Cartwright our captain at whose house we remained till our embarcation. A very short distance from the house upon the hill that rises gently from the sands is one of the most curious rocks I ever saw and indeed perhaps the only one of the kind. A large flat surface of rock about an hundred yards each way is intersected with cracks and fissures some of which are three or four yards deep exactly in the stile of clay where after having been wet it is dried by the heat of the sun. Some little puddles of clay which we found on the rock gave us an opportunity of observing how exactly similar the cracks were in each, the only difference was in size, and softness for the colour is exactly the same. I believe the fuellists and antifuellists as they are called or in other words, those who refer to the influence of fire, the present appearance of the earth and those who ascribe everything to the universal deluge would find here reason to assent in some degree to the opinions of each other. We slept at our captains house and were as much pleased with the treatment we experienced, as we were with the modesty of the charge, which was only five shillings for two nights and a day between us both. Two of our companions were gone to a small village nearer to the vessel. We went on board about half past ten, after having walked six miles over the wet sand and waded through two rivers, one of which was very rapid. At about half past four we weighed anchor but we had not been under sail ten minutes before we had the misfortune to hear that we were on a sand bank, and must remain there till about half past two in the next morning in the same situation.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Kendal",176,182],["Kendal",359,365],["Sizergh",596,603],["Kendal",614,620],["Sizergh",721,728],["Strickland",999,1009],["Elizabeth",1030,1039],["Strickland",1290,1300],["Elizabeth",1316,1325],["Levens",1371,1377],["Levens",1419,1425],["Suffolk",1588,1595],["Strickland",2555,2565],["Sizergh",2569,2576],["Sizergh",2601,2608],["River Kent",2837,2847],["Kendal",3484,3490],["Kendal",3602,3608],["Liverpool",3704,3713]],"geonouns":[["island",25,31],["shore",73,78],["lake",156,160],["castle",305,311],["residence",321,330],["country",399,406],["town",532,536],["monuments",564,573],["hall",713,717],["mansion",757,764],["country",805,812],["tower",921,926],["house",1165,1170],["seat",1407,1411],["seat",1576,1580],["hall",1685,1689],["chapel",2142,2148],["bed",2207,2210],["hall",2254,2258],["park",2865,2869],["falls",2879,2884],["house",3003,3008],["trees",3290,3295],["terraces",3332,3340],["beds",3398,3402],["field",3642,3647],["house",3868,3873],["house",3939,3944],["hill",3954,3958],["sands",3986,3991],["rocks",4019,4024],["rock",4105,4109],["rock",4368,4372],["house",4855,4860],["village",5079,5086],["rivers",5217,5223],["bank",5399,5403]],"pos_words":[["great",19,24],["lively",106,112],["beautiful",132,141],["neat",540,544],["respectable",886,897],["respectable",1395,1406],["handsome",2192,2200],["handsome",2306,2314],["superior",2621,2629],["profusion",2645,2654],["fine",2917,2921],["modern",2973,2979],["master",3241,3247],["recommended",3572,3583],["work",3626,3630],["pleased",4878,4885],["modesty",4941,4948],["rapid",5247,5252]],"neg_words":[["miserable",225,234],["wretched",249,257],["lost",862,866],["floored",1690,1697],["hung",1939,1943],["fallacy",2703,2710],["peculiar",2760,2768],["spoiled",2958,2965],["troubles",3219,3227],["cracks",4162,4168],["fissures",4173,4181],["cracks",4433,4439],["deluge",4744,4750],["misfortune",5357,5367]],"events":[],"dates":[["the 29th",3692,3700],["a day",5013,5018],["half past two",5438,5451]],"times":[["about six in the evening",183,207],["the morning of the 27th",641,664],["the next morning",3803,3819],["two nights",4998,5008],["half past ten",5132,5145],["ten minutes",5327,5338],["the next morning",5455,5471]],"distances":[["twenty feet",2890,2901],["seven miles",3467,3478],["six miles",5167,5176]],"loc_advs":[["left",7,11],["there",217,222],["here",927,931],["above",1785,1790],["left",2278,2282],["here",2485,2489],["here",2660,2664],["near",2885,2889],["here",3171,3175],["there",3792,3797],["here",4762,4766],["past",5268,5272],["there",5421,5426]],"spa_preps":[["along",63,68],["about",1076,1081],["under",1260,1265],["about",1753,1758],["round",1851,1856],["over",1916,1920],["above",2150,2155],["through",2853,2860],["over",3034,3038],["outside",3046,3053],["out",3378,3381],["about",4110,4115],["between",5019,5026],["about",5126,5131],["over",5177,5181],["through",5205,5212],["about",5257,5262],["under",5316,5321],["about",5432,5437]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0084745763,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9983093739},{"para_id":52,"paragraph":"We set sail on the return of the tide, the wind was not in our favour, yet not so much against us, as to oblige us to tack, about five in the morning we saw Peel Castle, to the right, and the isle of Walney a low flat island, about nine miles in length and not one in breadth. On the left were two towers of Arnside, and Haslop which as the vulgar believe were built by some great man, together with Dalham tower for the residence of his three daughters and coheirs. The two first in ruins the last inhabited, and entirely rebuilt by a gentleman of the name of Wilson who resides at the tower, within quarter of a mile from Milnthrop. Not long after we saw Lancaster and a miserable flat coast which stretches from thence to Liverpool on which is situated Blackpool, a place of late much frequented by inhabitants of both towns, as a summer residence. There is not a single tree near it nor indeed could I perceive one the whole voyage. About half past two we began to approach Liverpool and the tide favouring us we soon arrived at the powder magazine, after we had passed the beacon. Here we left our vessel as the Captain was obliged to unload about twenty tonnes of Gunpowder which had been conveyed through a most terrible storm of thunder and lightening all the way from Milnthrop. The boat landed us at the docks about three miles higher up and on the other side of the river. We slept at Liverpool and in the morning after seeing as much of the town as our time would permit took a passage in the Chester packet for Eastham about seven miles from the Mersey. The morning was fine a brisk wind sprung up and in about three quarters of an hour we reached the spot where we were to meet the coach which conveyed us to Chester.","file_id":"1968_a","plnames":[["Peel",157,161],["Castle",162,168],["Walney",200,206],["Arnside",308,315],["Lancaster",657,666],["Liverpool",725,734],["Liverpool",978,987],["Liverpool",1396,1405],["Chester",1505,1512],["Chester",1723,1730]],"geonouns":[["isle",192,196],["island",218,224],["towers",298,304],["tower",407,412],["residence",421,430],["tower",587,592],["coast",688,693],["towns",822,827],["residence",841,850],["tree",874,878],["beacon",1078,1084],["boat",1292,1296],["river",1377,1382],["town",1453,1457],["coach",1696,1701]],"pos_words":[["favour",63,69],["right",177,182],["great",375,380],["fine",1583,1587],["brisk",1590,1595]],"neg_words":[["vulgar",341,347],["ruins",484,489],["miserable",673,682],["terrible",1219,1227]],"events":[],"dates":[["a summer",832,840],["half past two",943,956],["about three quarters",1618,1638]],"times":[["five in",130,137],["the morning",138,149],["the morning",1413,1424],["The morning",1567,1578],["an hour",1642,1649]],"distances":[["about nine miles",226,242],["quarter of a mile",601,618],["about three miles",1320,1337],["about seven miles",1532,1549]],"loc_advs":[["left",284,288],["together",386,394],["left",1094,1098]],"spa_preps":[["against",87,94],["about",124,129],["within",594,600],["near",879,883],["about",1147,1152],["through",1204,1211]],"normalised_sentiment":0.00625,"vader_sentiment":-0.59,"roberta_sentiment":0.9909605384}]
