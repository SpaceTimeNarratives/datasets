In the green vale of the Lune below lies the town, spreading up the side of a round hill overtopped by the old towers of the castle and the church. Beyond, over a ridge of gentle heights, which bind the west side of the vale, the noble inlet of the sea, that flows upon the Ulverston and Lancaster sands, is seen at the feet of an amphitheatre formed by nearly all the mountains of the Lakes; an exhibition of alpine grandeur, both in form and colouring, which, with the extent of water below, compose a scenery perhaps faintly rivalling that of the Lake of Geneva.

To the latter considerable additions are building in the Gothic style, which, when time shall have shaded the stone, will harmonize well with the venerable towers and gatehouse of the old structure. From a turret rising over the leads of the castle, called John o' Gaunt's Chair, the prospect is still finer than from the terrace of the churchyard below. Overlooking the Lune and its green slopes, the eye ranges to the bay of the sea beyond, and to the Cumberland and Lancashire mountains. On an island near the extremity of the peninsula of Low Furness, the double point of Peel Castle starts up from the sea, but is so distant that it resembles a forked rock. This peninsula, which separates the bay of Ulverston from the Irish Channel, swells gradually into a pointed mountain called Blackcomb, thirty miles from Lancaster, the fisst in the amphitheatre, that binds the bay. Hence a range of lower, but more broken and forked summits, extends northward to the fells of High Furness, rolled behind each other, huge, towering and dark; then, higher still, Langdale Pikes, with a confusion of other fells, that crown the head of Windermere and retire towards Keswick, whose gigantic mountains, Helvelyn and Saddleback, are, however, sunk in distance below the horizon of the nearer ones. The top of Skiddaw may be discerned when the air is clear, but it is too far off to appear with dignity. From Windermere Fells the heights soften towards the Vale of Lonsdale, on the east side of which Ingleborough, a mountain in Craven, rears his rugged front, the loftiest and most majestic in the scene. The nearer country, from this point of the landscape, is intersected with cultivated hills, between which the Lune winds its bright but shallow stream, falling over a weir and passing under a very handsome stone bridge at the entrance of the town, in its progress towards the sea. A ridge of rocky eminences shelters Lancaster on the east, whence they decline into the low and uninteresting country, that stretches to the Channel.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Lancaster",31,40],["Lune",494,498],["Cumberland",577,587],["Lancashire",592,602],["Furness",670,677],["Peel",699,703],["Castle",704,710],["Ulverston",829,838],["Irish Channel",848,861],["Blackcomb",911,920],["Lancaster",940,949],["Furness",1101,1108],["Langdale Pikes",1181,1195],["Windermere",1253,1263],["Keswick",1283,1290],["Saddleback",1331,1341],["Skiddaw",1423,1430],["Windermere",1522,1532],["Ingleborough",1614,1626],["Craven",1642,1648],["Lune",1829,1833],["Lancaster",2036,2045]],"geonouns":[["town",12,16],["castle",21,27],["building",164,172],["stone",233,238],["towers",279,285],["castle",365,371],["terrace",445,452],["slopes",513,519],["bay",543,546],["sea",554,557],["mountains",603,612],["island",620,626],["point",690,695],["sea",730,733],["rock",780,784],["bay",822,825],["mountain",895,903],["bay",997,1000],["summits",1053,1060],["head",1245,1249],["mountains",1307,1316],["horizon",1384,1391],["top",1416,1419],["mountain",1630,1638],["country",1730,1737],["point",1749,1754],["landscape",1762,1771],["hills",1804,1809],["stream",1863,1869],["stone",1925,1930],["bridge",1931,1937],["entrance",1945,1953],["town",1961,1965],["sea",1995,1998],["ridge",2002,2007],["country",2110,2117]],"pos_words":[["well",67,71],["harmonize",245,254],["well",255,259],["leads",352,357],["finer",425,430],["clear",1464,1469],["dignity",1508,1515],["majestic",1696,1704],["bright",1844,1850],["handsome",1916,1924],["progress",1974,1982]],"neg_words":[["broken",1035,1041],["dark",1155,1159],["confusion",1204,1213],["sunk",1357,1361],["shallow",1855,1862],["falling",1871,1878],["rocky",2011,2016],["decline",2071,2078]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["thirty miles",922,934]],"loc_advs":[["near",627,631],["northward",1070,1079],["behind",1117,1123]],"spa_preps":[["over",343,347],["below",471,476],["beyond",558,564],["into",880,884],["below",1374,1379],["between",1811,1818],["over",1879,1883],["under",1903,1908],["into",2079,2083]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0157894737,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.9975042939},{"para_id":21,"paragraph":"The appearance of the northern Fells is ever changing with the weather and shifting lights.

The perspective was terminated by the tall peeping heads of the Westmoreland fells, the nearer ones tinged with faintest purple, the more distant with light azure; and this is the general boundary to a scene, in the midst of which, enclosed between nearer and lower hills, lies the vale of Lonsdale, of a character mild, delicate and reposing, like the countenance of a Madona.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Lune",768,772],["Ingleborough",795,807],["Westmoreland",1129,1141]],"geonouns":[["lawn",18,22],["wood",55,59],["park",69,73],["hill",113,117],["towers",124,130],["foot",145,149],["stone",161,166],["bridge",167,173],["bed",217,220],["castle",248,254],["church",260,266],["tower",297,302],["road",334,338],["village",394,401],["brow",407,411],["vale",462,466],["passes",492,498],["trees",536,541],["ground",554,560],["valley",578,584],["meadows",592,599],["woods",633,638],["cottages",651,659],["villages",664,672],["bank",756,760],["feet",780,784],["hills",788,793],["ground",840,846],["vale",875,879],["top",927,930],["slopes",1044,1050],["feet",1059,1063],["heads",1116,1121],["hills",1331,1336],["vale",1347,1351]],"pos_words":[["good",156,160],["handsome",278,286],["interesting",362,373],["sweeping",569,577],["vivid",612,617],["richness",721,729],["elegantly",821,830],["enchanting",864,874],["right",888,893],["like",932,936],["soft",1005,1009],["rich",1022,1026],["delicate",1386,1394],["like",1409,1413]],"neg_words":[["steep",12,17],["dark",628,632],["swelling",831,839],["broken",920,926],["smoke",937,942],["lies",1338,1342]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["some miles",412,422]],"loc_advs":[["above",131,136]],"spa_preps":[["between",32,39],["along",82,87],["over",174,178],["near",239,243],["over",447,451],["beneath",500,507],["among",686,691],["along",910,915],["between",1306,1313]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0606060606,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980972409},{"para_id":26,"paragraph":"Descending Melling brow, and winding among the perpetually-changing scenery of the valley, we approached Ingleborough; and it was interesting to observe the lines of its bolder features gradually strengthening, and the shadowy markings of its minuter ones becoming more distinct, as we advanced.

Below, the lake reflected the gloom of the woods, and was sometimes marked with long white lines, which, we were told, indicated bad weather; but, except when a sudden gust swept the surface, it gave back every image on the shore, as in a dark mirror.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Parsonage",57,66],["Wallow Crag",409,420],["Martindale",542,552],["Wallow Crag",802,813],["Bampton",1009,1016]],"geonouns":[["lake",32,36],["building",81,89],["mountain",119,127],["grove",134,139],["water",204,209],["door",220,224],["lake",252,256],["promontory",395,405],["lake",446,450],["hamlet",532,538],["grove",580,585],["ridge",765,770],["precipices",774,784],["bay",838,841],["lake",868,872],["forest",895,901],["wood",957,961],["water",969,974],["vale",1017,1021],["landscape",1046,1055],["lake",1088,1092],["woods",1120,1125],["lines",1168,1173],["shore",1301,1306]],"pos_words":[["eminence",294,302],["enough",332,338],["advantage",350,359],["advanced",470,478],["bright",503,509],["sweetly",720,727],["bright",1057,1063]],"neg_words":[["falling",184,191],["darker",646,652],["dark",941,945],["gloom",1107,1112],["bad",1206,1209],["dark",1316,1320]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["southward",814,823],["northward",926,935]],"spa_preps":[["into",437,441],["among",572,577],["beneath",752,759]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0078125,"vader_sentiment":0.35,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986085296},{"para_id":68,"paragraph":"The interior of the Parsonage was as comfortable as the situation was interesting.

In this reach, they lose the form of a river, and resume that of a lake, being closed, at three miles distance, by the ruinous rocks, that guard the gorge of Patterdale, backed by a multitude of fells.

Round the whole of these shores, but particularly on the left, rose clusters of dark and pointed summits, assuming great variety of shape, amongst which Helvellyn was still pre-eminent. Immediately around us, all was vast and gloomy; the fells mount swiftly and to enormous heights, leaving at their bases only crags and hillocks, tufted with thickets of dwarf-oak and holly, where the beautiful cattle, that adorned them, and a few sheep, were picking a scanty supper among the heath.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Patterdale",131,141],["Helvellyn",1162,1171]],"geonouns":[["inn",4,7],["village",22,29],["crags",61,66],["meadows",207,214],["lake",228,232],["cottage",294,301],["rocks",400,405],["station",431,438],["lake",502,506],["point",680,685],["meadow",726,732],["land",733,737],["fell",738,742],["lake",757,761],["precipices",831,841],["rocks",878,883],["shores",1034,1040],["summits",1106,1113],["mount",1253,1258],["crags",1320,1325]],"pos_words":[["securely",31,39],["right",103,108],["happy",264,269],["cleanly",286,293],["lover",530,535],["fine",664,668],["great",781,786],["majesty",787,794],["right",818,823],["finely",884,890],["great",1124,1129],["variety",1130,1137],["pre-eminent",1182,1193],["beautiful",1395,1404]],"neg_words":[["broken",911,917],["dark",1089,1093],["gloomy",1235,1241]],"events":[["Round",1009,1014]],"dates":[],"times":[["evening",270,277]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",11,17],["there",309,314],["without",328,335],["left",869,873],["left",1066,1070]],"spa_preps":[["under",50,55],["close",90,95],["among",188,193],["over",417,421],["beyond",795,801],["amongst",1148,1155],["around",1207,1213],["among",1478,1483]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0820895522,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988589287},{"para_id":107,"paragraph":"From this spot glens open on either hand, that lead the eye only to a chaos of mountains.

But these have nothing either picturesque or fantastic in their shape; they are heavy, not broken into parts, and their rudeness softens into insignificance, when they are seen over the wide channel of the lake; they are neither large enough to be grand, or wooded enough to be beautiful. To the north, or head of Windermere, however, the tameness of its general character disappears, and the scene soars into grandeur. Here, over a ridge of rough brown hills above a woody shore, rise, at the distance of a mile and half, or two miles, a multitude of finely alpine mountains, retiring obliquely in the perspective, among which Langdale Pikes, Hardknot and Wry Nose, bearing their bold, pointed promontories aloft, are pre-eminent. The colouring of these mountains, which are some of the grandest of Cumberland and Westmoreland, was this day remarkably fine. The weather was showery, with gleams of sunshine; sometimes their tops were entirely concealed in gray vapours, which, drawing upwards, would seem to ascend in volumes of smoke from their summits; at others, a few scattered clouds wandered along their sides leaving their heads unveiled and effulgent with light. These clouds disappearing before the strength of the sun, a fine downy hue of light blue overspread the peeping points of the most distant fells, while the nearer ones were tinged with deep purple, which was opposed to the brown heath and crag of the lower hills, the olive green of two wooded slopes that, just tinted by autumn, seemed to descend to the margin, and the silver transparency of the expanding water at their feet. This view of Windermere appears with great majesty from a height above Culgarth, a seat of the Bishop of Landaff; while, to the south, the lake after sweeping about four miles gradually narrows and disappears behind the great island, which stretches across the perspective.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Windermere",0,10],["Windermere",711,721],["Langdale Pikes",1025,1039],["Hardknot",1041,1049],["Cumberland",1197,1207],["Westmoreland",1212,1224],["Windermere",2011,2021]],"geonouns":[["river",112,117],["points",148,154],["land",158,162],["wood",195,199],["hills",246,251],["summits",272,279],["shore",346,351],["water",390,395],["channel",588,595],["lake",603,607],["head",703,707],["ridge",830,835],["hills",851,856],["shore",871,876],["mountains",963,972],["promontories",1092,1104],["mountains",1152,1161],["summits",1444,1451],["heads",1528,1533],["points",1681,1687],["crag",1808,1812],["hills",1826,1831],["slopes",1863,1869],["water",1977,1982],["feet",1992,1996],["seat",2081,2085],["lake",2137,2141],["island",2224,2230]],"pos_words":[["like",96,100],["majestic",103,111],["easy",126,130],["picturesque",427,438],["fantastic",442,451],["enough",632,638],["grand",645,650],["enough",662,668],["beautiful",675,684],["grandeur",807,815],["finely",949,955],["pre-eminent",1116,1127],["remarkably",1239,1249],["fine",1250,1254],["tops",1322,1326],["great",2035,2040],["majesty",2041,2048],["sweeping",2148,2156],["great",2218,2223]],"neg_words":[["rocky",364,369],["broken",488,494],["insignificance",539,553],["rough",839,844],["smoke",1427,1432]],"events":[],"dates":[["the middle of the",320,337],["this day",1230,1238],["a fine",1627,1633],["autumn",1891,1897]],"times":[],"distances":[["twelve miles",18,30],["a mile",56,62],["about six miles",298,313],["a mile and half",903,918],["two miles",923,932],["about four miles",2157,2173]],"loc_advs":[["above",50,55],["between",136,143],["above",857,862],["upwards",1383,1390],["behind",2207,2213],["across",2248,2254]],"spa_preps":[["above",12,17],["into",241,245],["along",314,319],["over",381,385],["into",495,499],["into",534,538],["over",574,578],["into",802,806],["over",823,827],["among",1013,1018],["along",1496,1501],["above",2063,2068]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0682926829,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9478315711},{"para_id":227,"paragraph":"At the distance of two or three miles beyond Culgarth, from a hill advancing towards the water, the whole of Windermere is seen; to the right, is the white mansion at Culgarth, among wood, on a gentle eminence of the shore, with the lake spreading wide beyond, crowned by the fells half obscured in clouds.

The most impressive pictures were formed by the fells, that crowd over the upper end of the lake, and which, viewed from a low station, sometimes appeared nearly to enclose that part of it. The effect was then astonishingly grand, particularly about sun-set, when the clouds, drawing upwards, discovered the utmost summits of these fells, and a tint of dusky blue began to prevail over them, which gradually deepened into night. A line of lower rocks, that extend from these, are, independently of the atmosphere, of a dull purple, and their shaggy forms would appear gigantic in almost any other situation. Even here, they preserve a wild dignity, and their attitudes somewhat resemble those at the entrance of Borrowdale; but they are forgotten, when the eye is lifted to the solemn mountains immediately above. These are rich in slate quarries, and have some copper mines; but the latter were closed, during the civil wars of the last century, having been worked, as we are told in the descriptive language of the miners, from the day to the evening end, forty fathom, and to the morning end seven score fathom; a figurative style of distinguishing the western and eastern directions of the mine. The lake, towards the lower end, narrows and is adorned by one small island; but here the hills of the eastern shore soar into fells, some barren, craggy and nearly perpendicular, others entirely with coppice-wood. Two of these, rising over the road, gave fine relief to each other, the one shewing only precipices of shelving rock, while its rival aspired with woods, that mantled from the base to the summit, consisting chiefly of oak, ash and holly. Not any lake, that we saw, is at present so much embellished with wood as Thurston. All the mountains of High and the vallies of Low Furness were, indeed, some centuries ago, covered with forests, part of which was called the Forest of Lancaster; and these were of such entangled luxuriance as to be nearly impenetrable in many tracts. Here, wolves, wild boars, and a remarkably large breed of deer, called Leghs, the heads of which have frequently been found buried at a considerable depth in the soil, abounded. So secure an asylum did these animals find in the woods of High Furness, that, even after the low lands were cleared and cultivated, shepherds were necessary to guard the flocks from the ravages of the wolves.

The original rules of St. Bernard partook in several instances of the austerities of those of La Trapp, and the society did not very readily relinquish the milder laws of St. Benedict for the new rigours imposed upon them by the parent monastery of Savigny. They were forbidden to taste flesh, except when ill, and even eggs, butter, cheese and milk, but on extraordinary occasions; and denied even the use of linen and fur. The monks were divided into two classes, to which separate departments belonged. -- Those, who attended the choir, slept upon straw in their usual habits, from which, at midnight, they rose and passed into the church, where they continued their holy hymns, during the short remainder of the night. After this first mass, having publicly confessed themselves, they retired to their cells, and the day was employed in spiritual exercises and in copying or illuminating manuscripts. An unbroken silence was observed, except when, after dinner, they withdrew into the locutorium, where for an hour, perhaps, they were permitted the common privilege of social beings. This class was confined to the boundary wall, except that, on some particular days, the members of it were allowed to walk in parties beyond it, for exercise and amusement; but they were very seldom permitted either to receive, or pay visits. Like the monks of La Trapp, however, they were distinguished for extensive charities and liberal hospitality; for travellers were so scrupulously entertained at the Abbey, that it was not till the dissolution that an inn was thought necessary in this part of Furness, when one was opened for their accommodation, expressly because the monastery could no longer receive them.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[["Savigny",164,171],["Normandy",175,183],["England",405,412],["Savigny",663,670],["Abbey",1910,1915],["Furness",2004,2011]],"geonouns":[["abbey",74,79],["church",1049,1055],["common",1467,1473],["wall",1542,1546],["inn",1962,1965]],"pos_words":[["magnificent",62,73],["dedicated",88,97],["readily",547,554],["extraordinary",772,785],["holy",1084,1088],["spiritual",1255,1264],["illuminating",1293,1305],["privilege",1474,1483],["distinguished",1792,1805]],"neg_words":[["severe",290,296],["dissolution",371,382],["forbidden",682,691],["denied",801,807],["confined",1517,1525],["dissolution",1942,1953]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",1231,1238],["some particular days",1564,1584]],"times":[["midnight",1009,1017],["the night",1126,1135],["an hour",1425,1432]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",862,866],["into",1040,1044],["into",1394,1398],["beyond",1636,1642]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0169491525,"vader_sentiment":0.94,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9862902761},{"para_id":266,"paragraph":"To the second class were assigned the cultivation of the lands, and the performance of domestic affairs in the monastery.","file_id":"1795_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["lands",57,62]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.98733145},{"para_id":267,"paragraph":"This was the second house in England, that received the Bernardine rules, the most rigorous of which were, however, dispensed with in 1485 by Sixtus the Fourth, when, among other indulgences, the whole order was allowed to taste meat on three days of the week.
