If I might be permitted to elucidate this erroneous pas sage, it should be by altering his direction thus: after having observed the yew tree on the common, and the tree on the peninsula which he describes, then pass through the first gate, and continue on the road to a second, which opening you will see the small rivulet and bridge, he mentions, a few yards before you, and not in the grove, for that is all along inclosed by a flight hedge to the right. Proceed about one hundred yards farther and the fragment of rock presents itself near the road in the water. Here we had a very satisfactory view of the crystal lake to its greatest extent, and the Westmorland fells towering on the opposite shore have a noble appearance. The views from every part of Coniston Water must be allowed beautiful, yet they give an agreeable satisfaction to the mind rather than strike the eye with ravishment and wonder. The char here are esteemed particularly fine, and are taken both late and early in the season. Thus having satisfied this part of our curiosity we pursued the road about four miles rather inclining to the east, which brought us to the small town of Hawkshead, the place appointed for this night's abode; but the evening was too far advanced to permit our enjoying the fine prospect, which the several hills we pas sed over would otherwise have afforded. We found a comfortable en - tertainment at the Red Lion, the only house of resort for travellers; and the next morning continuing bright and charming as before, we set off about seven for the ferry on Windermere lake, and pas sing over a bridge about half a mile down the vale, came upon the margin of Esthwaite Water; a sweet little oval lake, two miles long and one broad. Hear the serenity of the morning afforded us the most delightful ride imaginable, for not a breeze stirring, the watery surface became a perfect mirror, and reflected the inverted landscape more softly coloured than ever art or nature had before presented to our view. Indeed the neat village of Hawkshead, with its milk-white tower, and several cots and groves which project this way, together with the over-hanging trees, and mountains, form a most compleat group for the pencil of the Artist. Quitting this lovely landscape we soon gain - ed the summit of the hill which first presents that glory of these lakes, Windermere Water; hence continuing round a rocky mountain northwards, we came without difficulty to Mr. West's first station; and mounting the craggy summit, we were delighted with innumerable beauties of lake, wood and island, diversified in all the various windings and intersections of wonderful nature, surrounded by all the grandeur of near and distant mountains hanging one upon another in most surprizing forms; but not contented with this elevated situation, we ascended the jutting rock above with much difficulty, and reaped no advantage from our labor; these giddy heights only adding horror to the scene without its former softened beauties; from whence descending even on our hands and knees, we were glad to find ourselves again on terra firma, and pursuing the road directly to the ferry, we were soon conveyed across this narrow part of the lake, to the small village of Bowness, whose church is remarkable for containing some of the painted glass, taken out of the east window at Furness Abbey, which is esteemed curious and beautiful. Leaving our horses at a small ale-house, we took a boat to visit the large island, now belonging to John Christian, Esq. of Unerig, in Cumberland, whose elegant improvements are numerous and praiseworthy, since the observations of Mr. Hutchinson and other visitors, whose remarks must be deemed too censorious and unjust, the slopes and meandring walks are both proper and ornamental; nor can the change of building on its present scale be deemed unnatural or improper; for it cannot be supposed that a gentleman of extensive fortune, can in these luxurious days, when convenience and art spread themselves to the remotest parts of the kingdom, confine him - self to the narrow limits of an original cottage. This mansion does not affect many ornaments of art and fancy, but shews a style of architecture, plain and neat, best suited to such a situation. The additions now making, wear a proper cast of antiquity and romantic soft ness, and when the plantations grow to perfection, the whole cannot fail to please every eye that is not severely critical.","file_id":"1788_b","plnames":[["Westmorland",817,828],["Coniston Water",920,934],["Hawkshead",1318,1327],["Red Lion",1570,1578],["Windermere",1724,1734],["Esthwaite Water",1825,1840],["Hawkshead",2194,2203],["Windermere",2514,2524],["Bowness",3401,3408],["Furness Abbey",3511,3524],["Unerig",3691,3697],["Cumberland",3702,3712]],"geonouns":[["station",10,17],["tree",298,302],["common",310,316],["tree",326,330],["pass",373,377],["gate",396,400],["road",422,426],["bridge",489,495],["grove",549,554],["rock",679,683],["road",709,713],["water",721,726],["lake",780,784],["shore",860,865],["road",1228,1232],["town",1310,1314],["hills",1470,1475],["house",1589,1594],["ferry",1715,1720],["lake",1735,1739],["bridge",1761,1767],["vale",1795,1799],["lake",1862,1866],["landscape",2078,2087],["village",2183,2190],["tower",2225,2230],["groves",2253,2259],["trees",2315,2320],["mountains",2326,2335],["landscape",2415,2424],["summit",2447,2453],["hill",2461,2465],["lakes",2507,2512],["mountain",2563,2571],["station",2631,2638],["summit",2664,2670],["lake",2719,2723],["wood",2725,2729],["island",2734,2740],["windings",2773,2781],["mountains",2872,2881],["rock",3005,3009],["road",3290,3294],["ferry",3311,3316],["lake",3371,3375],["village",3390,3397],["church",3416,3422],["house",3601,3606],["boat",3618,3622],["island",3642,3648],["slopes",3893,3899],["building",3974,3982],["cottage",4267,4274],["mansion",4281,4288]],"pos_words":[["readily",30,37],["right",612,617],["satisfactory",747,759],["greatest",792,800],["noble",873,878],["beautiful",951,960],["agreeable",979,988],["wonder",1061,1067],["fine",1109,1113],["satisfied",1176,1185],["advanced",1401,1409],["enjoying",1424,1432],["fine",1437,1441],["comfortable",1534,1545],["bright",1653,1659],["charming",1664,1672],["sweet",1844,1849],["serenity",1907,1915],["delightful",1952,1962],["breeze",1990,1996],["perfect",2035,2042],["neat",2178,2182],["lovely",2408,2414],["gain",2433,2437],["glory",2492,2497],["delighted",2680,2689],["diversified",2742,2753],["wonderful",2803,2812],["grandeur",2843,2851],["advantage",3052,3061],["glad",3228,3232],["remarkable",3426,3436],["beautiful",3556,3565],["elegant",3720,3727],["improvements",3728,3740],["praiseworthy",3758,3770],["proper",3929,3935],["fortune",4093,4100],["convenience",4136,4147],["fancy",4331,4336],["neat",4383,4387],["best",4389,4393],["proper",4455,4461],["romantic",4484,4492],["soft",4493,4497],["perfection",4537,4547]],"neg_words":[["confused",124,132],["erroneous",203,212],["hedge",599,604],["strike",1026,1032],["rocky",2557,2562],["difficulty",2600,2610],["difficulty",3026,3036],["giddy",3084,3089],["unjust",3881,3887],["unnatural",4014,4023],["improper",4027,4035],["limits",4245,4251],["fail",4566,4570],["critical",4612,4620]],"events":[],"dates":[["early in the season",1143,1162],["these luxurious days",4109,4129]],"times":[["this night",1353,1363],["the evening",1377,1388],["the next morning",1625,1641],["the morning",1919,1930]],"distances":[["about four miles",1233,1249],["about half a mile",1768,1785],["two miles",1868,1877]],"loc_advs":[["near",700,704],["here",1078,1082],["together",2284,2292],["northwards",2572,2582],["without",2592,2599],["without",3130,3137]],"spa_preps":[["out",47,50],["through",378,385],["along",572,577],["about",627,632],["opposite",851,859],["over",1487,1491],["about",1695,1700],["over",1754,1758],["down",1786,1790],["over",2302,2306],["round",2549,2554],["near",2855,2859],["above",3010,3015],["across",3340,3346],["out",3485,3488]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0761904762,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9990717173},{"para_id":28,"paragraph":"The several stations on this island, pointed out by our inimitable guide, produce effects truly picturesque and charming;

How fortunate is it then for the visitors of these scenes to have an unexpected resource during the tedious intervals of rain. A well adorned Museum is the place of amusement here alluded to, kept by Mr. Crosthwaite, late a Lieutenant in the Navy, whose attention to the curious works of nature has given him the opportunity of mak - ing a considerable collection for the inspection of the public.
