Many of these Engravings were miscellaneous, and those,( which were, indeed, the far greater part of them,) whose description was submitted to such a Muse as mine, represented views of interesting objects, and beautiful Scenery, or were occasional decorations appropriate to the work. The designs to which this volume is so greatly indebted, I was informed would follow in a Series, and it was proposed to me to shape out a story from them. - - An Etching or a Drawing was accordingly sent to me every month, and I composed a certain proportion of pages in verse, in which, of course, the subject of the design was included: the rest depended upon what my imagination could furnish. When the first print was sent to me, I did not know what would be the subject of the second; and in this manner, in a great measure, the Artist continued designing, and I continued writing, every month for two years,' till a Work, containing near ten thousand Lines was produced: the Artist and the Writer having no personal communication with, or knowledge of each other. This vast collection of verses, however, appeared to advance the purpose of the Magazine in which they grew into such an unexpected accumulation. - - Mr. Ackermann was satisfied with my Service, and I was satisfied with the remuneration of it. - - I felt no parental fondness for the work though it was written at that very advanced period of Life, when we are apt to attach Importance to any little unexpected exertion of decaying strength. - - It would have been no more thought of by me: - - But Mr. Ackermann has his reasons for risquing a republication of it, in its present form; and I now feel more than common solicitude that it should answer his expectations.
