Here they were opposed by the townsmen, who kept the garrison, and if they did not immediately return by the way they came, the alarm brought upon them the garrisons from Overborough, Watercrook, and Ambleside, who surrounded and cut them off. Hence arose a particular hatred to the Lancastrians, which time and repeated injuries fomented into rage. In the end, the barbarous clans, following close upon the heels of the flying Romans, would in a particular manner satiate their desire of revenge upon the helpless Lancastrians, by sacking and destroying their town and fortifications, that such another at no time might oppose their invasions. The Saxons arriving soon after, raised on the ruins, the town that remains to this day. So it may be inferred, that the present town of Lancaster stands on a magazine of British Roman antiquities.

It is three miles across from Cark Lane, where you quit the sands to Sand Yet. Pass through Flookborough, once a market-town, by charter granted to the prior of Cartmel, lord paramount, from King Edward I. The only thing worthy of notice, is the church of Cartmel, a handsome gothic edifice. The east window is finely ribbed with pointed arches, light and elegant; the painted glass is almost defaced. The preservation of this edifice reflects honour on the memory of George Preston, of Holker Esq; who, at his own expence new roofed the whole, and decorated the inside with a stucco ceiling; the choir and chancel he also repaired, suiting the new parts to the ancient remains of the canons seats, thereby preserving the ancient form entire. Persons uninformed of this, always take it to be the same it was before the dissolution. The stile of the building, like most of it contemporaries, is irregular. The pointed and round arch is contrasted, and the fine clustered pillar faces the heavy octagonal. The form is a cross, in length 157 feet; the transept 110 feet; the height of the walls 57 feet. The tower on the center is a singular construction, being a square within a square, the higher set at cross angles within the lower: This gives it an off appearance on all sides, but may have some reference to the octagonal pillars in the church, and both to the memory of something now forgotten. It was built and endowed with the manor of Cartmel by William Mariscal, the elder, Earl of Pembroke, in 1188, according to some; but as in the foundation deed mention is made of Henry Ii. Richard, and Henry the younger, his lord the King, it appears rather to have been founded in the beginning of that reign; for Willia the elder, Earl of Pembroke, died in the fourth of fifth year of that reign, viz. Henry Iii. He gave it to the canons regular of St. Austin, reserving to himself and his heirs the right of granting to them the conge deslire of a prior, who should be independent of all others, and never to be erected into an abbey. Under the north wall, a little below the altar, is the tombstone of Willaim De Walton, prior of Cartmel: He is mentioned in the confirmation diploma of Edward Ii. and must have been one of the first priors. Opposite to this is a magnificent tomb of a Harrington, and his lady, which Mr. Pennant thinks may be of Sir John Harrington, who in 1305 was summoned by Edward I.\" with numbers of other gallant gentlemen to meet him at Carlisle, and attend him on his expedition into Scotland,\" but it agrees better with a John De Harrington, called John of Cartmel, or his son of Wrasham Tower, in Cartmel, as Sir Daniel Fleming's account of that family has it, M. s. L.A. I: 132. The head of the Harrington family, Sir John Harrington, in the reign of Edward I. was of Aldingham, and lived at Gleaston Castle in Furness, and died in an advanced age, 1347; and is more probably the Sir John Harrington mentioned in Dugdale's baronage, and summonded by Edward I. There is not one vestige of the monastry remaining. There is a gate house, but whether this was connected with the cloisters or not, tradition is silent, and the distance from the church in unfavourable to the conjecture.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Cartmel",0,7],["Lancashire",41,51],["Westmorland",67,78],["Bowness",94,101],["Windermere",106,116],["Leven",168,173],["Kent",178,182],["Morecambe",214,223],["Flookborough",317,329],["Cartmel",386,393],["Cartmel",481,488],["George",693,699],["Preston",700,707],["Holker",712,718],["Cartmel",1667,1674],["St. Austin",2074,2084],["Cartmel",2357,2364],["Harrington",2512,2522],["Harrington",2582,2592],["Carlisle",2688,2696],["Scotland",2736,2744],["Harrington",2783,2793],["Cartmel",2810,2817],["Wrasham Tower",2833,2846],["Cartmel",2851,2858],["Harrington",2950,2960],["Harrington",2978,2988],["Aldingham",3023,3032],["Gleaston Castle",3047,3062],["Furness",3066,3073],["Harrington",3144,3154]],"geonouns":[["district",19,27],["rivers",161,167],["bay",207,210],["sands",285,290],["market",338,344],["town",345,349],["church",471,477],["seats",917,922],["building",1074,1082],["walls",1311,1316],["tower",1330,1335],["church",1565,1571],["abbey",2254,2259],["wall",2277,2281],["head",2938,2942],["gate",3278,3282],["house",3283,3288],["church",3395,3401]],"pos_words":[["great",201,206],["paramount",400,409],["worthy",446,452],["handsome",492,500],["finely",536,542],["elegant",581,588],["like",1084,1088],["fine",1180,1184],["right",2125,2130],["magnificent",2490,2501],["gallant",2655,2662],["better",2761,2767],["advanced",3090,3098],["silent",3361,3367]],"neg_words":[["uninformed",976,986],["dissolution",1044,1055],["irregular",1119,1128],["died",1974,1978],["died",3079,3083]],"events":[],"dates":[["1188",1728,1732],["Ii.",1808,1811],["the fourth of fifth year",1982,2006],["Ii.",2420,2423],["1305",2601,2605],["1347",3104,3108]],"times":[],"distances":[["three miles",231,242],["157 feet",1260,1268],["110 feet",1283,1291],["57 feet",1317,1324]],"loc_advs":[["across",243,249],["below",2292,2297]],"spa_preps":[["below",88,93],["through",309,316],["inside",788,794],["round",1146,1151],["within",1393,1399],["within",1441,1447],["into",2246,2250],["into",2731,2735]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0286624204,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980879426},{"para_id":50,"paragraph":"Proceed through rocky fields and groves to Holker, one mile, the seat of the right honourable Lord George Cavendish; the carriage road is by Cark Hall.

In the south wall and east end of the church, are four seats, adorned with gothic ornaments; in these the officiating priest, with his attendants, sat at intervals, during the solemn service of high mass. In the middle space lies a procumbent figure of a man in armour, cross legged, in the place where the first barons of Kendal lie interred. The chapter house has been a noble room of sixty feet by forty five. The vaulted roof, formed of twelve ribbed arches, was supported by six pillars in two rows, at thirteen feet distance from each other, and the side walls; supposing each pillar two feet diameter, which divided the room into three alleys or passages of thirteen feet wide. At the enterance, the middle only could be seen, lighted by a pair of tall pointed windows at the upper end of the room; the company in the side passage would be concealed by the pillars, and the vaulted roof, that groined those pillars, would have a true gothic disproportioned appearance, of sixty feet, by thirteen. The two side alleys were lighted each by a pair of similar lights, besides a pair on each side at the upper end, at present entire, and illustrate what is here said. Thus whilst the upper end of the room had a profusion of light, the lower end would be in the shade. The noble roof of this singular edifice did by lately fall in; the entrance or porch is still up, a fine circular arch, beautified with a deep cornish, as also a portico on each side. The only entire roof now standing is of a building without the inclosure wall. It was a school-house for the children of the abbot's tenants, and is a single ribbed arch, that groins from the walls.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Furness",159,166],["Windermere",743,753],["Kendal",1241,1247]],"geonouns":[["beacon",47,53],["abbey",127,132],["door",172,176],["beacon",192,198],["wall",235,239],["abbey",283,288],["doors",436,441],["walls",539,544],["church",754,760],["head",823,827],["wall",931,935],["church",956,962],["seats",973,978],["house",1274,1279],["walls",1479,1484],["entrance",2256,2264],["building",2415,2423],["wall",2446,2450],["school",2461,2467],["house",2468,2473],["walls",2565,2570]],"pos_words":[["eminence",85,93],["leading",177,184],["enough",340,346],["fine",459,463],["excellent",550,559],["strong",616,622],["noble",656,661],["well",903,907],["noble",1291,1296],["supported",1385,1394],["profusion",2132,2141],["noble",2193,2198]],"neg_words":[["ruins",329,334],["ruins",608,613],["solemn",1094,1100],["lies",1143,1147],["lie",1248,1251],["fall",2243,2247]],"events":[],"dates":[["forty five",1319,1329],["a fine",2287,2293]],"times":[],"distances":[["sixty feet",1305,1315],["thirteen feet",1426,1439],["two feet",1508,1516],["thirteen feet",1583,1596],["sixty feet",1897,1907]],"loc_advs":[["opposite",848,856],["here",2077,2081],["without",2424,2431]],"spa_preps":[["over",146,150],["round",402,407],["outside",769,776],["under",791,796],["into",1550,1554]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0245901639,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9927736521},{"para_id":58,"paragraph":"There is a general disproportion remarkable in gothic churches, which must have originated in some effect intended by all the architects; perhaps to strike the mind with reverential awe at the sight of magnificence, arising from the vastness of two dimensions, the third seemingly disregarded; or perhaps such proportion of height and length was found more favourable than any other to the church song, by giving a deeper swell to the choir of chaunting monks.

See on the right a deep embayed coast, the islands of Walney, Foulney, and Peel Castle;-- a variety of extensive views on all sides. At Adgarly the new works are carried on under the old workings; the richest iron ore is found here in immense quantities; one hundred and forty tons have been raised at one shaft in twenty four hours. To the right have a view of the ruins of Gleaston Castle, the seat of the Flemings soon after the conquest; and by a succession of mariages, it went to Cansfield, then to Harrington, who enjoyed it six descents, after that to Bonville, and lastly to Gray, and was forfeited by Henry Gray Duke of Suffolk , A.D. 1559. Leaving Urswick behind, ascend Birkrig, a rocky eminence, and from the beacon have a variety of extensive and pleasant views, of land and sea, mountains and islands. Ulverston appears seated under a hanging wood, and behind that Furness Fells, in various shapes, form the grandest fore-ground that can be imagined. The back view is the reverse; when the tide is up, a fine arm of the sea stretching far within land, terminated by bold rocks and steep shores; across this expanse of sea a far country is seen, a Lancaster town and castle is perceived in a fine point under a screen of high grounds, over which sable Clougha rears his venerable head. Ingleborough, behind many other mountains, has a fine effect from this station. If in a carriage, return from the abbey by Dalton. This village is sweetly situated on the crest of a rocky eminence, sloping to the morning sun. upper-end is a square town, where formerly the abbot held his secular court, and secured his prisoners; the keep is in the bottom of the tower, a dismal dungeon. This village, being conveniently situated in a fine sporting country, is honoured with an annual hunt, begun by the late Lord Strange, and is continued by his son, the truly noble Earl of Derby. It commences the monday after the 24th of October, and continues two whole weeks. For the better accommodation of the company, two excellent long rooms were built about four years ago, and called Sportsman's Hall. Return to Ulverston and from thence to the priory of Conishead, the paradise of Furness, a Mount Edgcumbe in miniature; it well deserves a visit from the curious traveller. The house stands on the site of the priory of Conishead, at the foot of a fine eminence, and the ground falls gently from it on all sides; the slopes are planted with shrubs and trees in such a manner as improve the elevation; and the waving woods that fly from it on each wing give an airy and noble appearance. The south front is in the modern taste, extended by an arcade; the north is in the gothic stile, with a piazza; the offices on this side form wings. The appartments are elegantly furnished; and the house is a good and convenient one: But what recommends itself most to the curious is a plan of pleasure ground, on a small scale, raised by improvement, to equal one of the greatest in England. The variety of culminated grounds, and winding slopes, comprehended within this sweet spot, furnishes all the advantage of mountains and vales, woods and water. By the judicious management of these assemblages, the late owner did work wonders; and by well consulting the genius of the place called in to aid his plan, and harmonized the features of a country vast in extent, and by nature highly picturesque, whose distant parts answering, form a magnificent whole. Besides the ornamental grounds, the views from the house are both pleasing and surprising, pastoral, rural and marine. On one hand a fine estuary, spotted with rocks, isles, and peninsulas, a variety of shore, deeply indented in some places, in others composed of noble arched rocks, craggy, broken, and fringed with wood; other these hanging woods, intermixed with cultivated inclosures, covered with a back ground of stupendious mountains. The contrast of this view, at the other end of the gravel walk, between two culminating hills covered with tall wood, is seen, in fine perspective, a rich cultivated dale, divided by hedgerow trees, beyond these hanging grounds cut into inclosures, with scattered farms; above all, a long range of waving pasture ground and sheep walks, shining in variety of vegetation. This sweet pastoral picture is heightened much by the deep shade of the towering wooded hills, between which it is viewed. Turn to the left, the scenery is all reversed. Under a range of tall sycamores, an expanse of water bursts upon the eye, and beyond it, land just visible through the azure mist. Vessels traversing this bay are seen in a most picturesque manner, and from the lower windows, appear failing through the trees, and approaching the house, till they drop anchor just under the windows. The range of sycamores has a fine effect in this sea view, by breaking the line in the watery plane, and forming an elegant frame to a very excellent picture. By turning a little to the right the prospect changes; at the head of a sloping inclosure, and under the skirts of a steep wood, a sequestered cottage stands in the point of beauty.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Newton",44,50],["Stainton",52,60],["Adgarly",66,73],["Walney",129,135],["Foulney",137,144],["Peel",150,154],["Adgarly",211,218],["Gleaston Castle",450,465],["Flemings",483,491],["Harrington",580,590],["Suffolk",705,712],["Urswick",734,741],["Birkrig",757,764],["Ulverston",892,901],["Furness",955,962],["Lancaster",1237,1246],["Clougha",1341,1348],["Ingleborough",1375,1387],["Dalton",1498,1504],["Sportsman's Hall",2154,2170],["Ulverston",2182,2191],["Conishead",2225,2234],["Furness",2252,2259],["Mount",2263,2268],["Conishead",2391,2400],["England",3042,3049]],"geonouns":[["abbey",9,14],["coast",107,112],["islands",118,125],["seat",471,475],["beacon",797,803],["land",855,859],["sea",864,867],["mountains",869,878],["islands",883,890],["wood",933,937],["ground",1012,1018],["sea",1110,1113],["land",1136,1140],["rocks",1161,1166],["shores",1177,1183],["sea",1208,1211],["country",1218,1225],["town",1247,1251],["castle",1256,1262],["point",1286,1291],["grounds",1315,1322],["head",1369,1373],["mountains",1407,1416],["station",1446,1453],["carriage",1463,1471],["abbey",1489,1494],["village",1511,1518],["town",1623,1627],["tower",1738,1743],["village",1768,1775],["country",1824,1831],["house",2349,2354],["foot",2409,2413],["ground",2442,2448],["slopes",2488,2494],["trees",2523,2528],["woods",2587,2592],["house",2856,2861],["ground",2961,2967],["grounds",3077,3084],["winding",3090,3097],["slopes",3098,3104],["mountains",3174,3183],["vales",3188,3193],["woods",3195,3200],["water",3205,3210],["country",3402,3409],["grounds",3540,3547],["house",3568,3573],["estuary",3655,3662],["rocks",3677,3682],["isles",3684,3689],["shore",3720,3725],["rocks",3794,3799],["wood",3834,3838],["woods",3860,3865],["ground",3926,3932],["mountains",3948,3957],["hills",4047,4052],["wood",4071,4075],["dale",4125,4129],["trees",4151,4156],["grounds",4179,4186],["farms",4223,4228],["ground",4272,4278],["hills",4418,4423],["water",4547,4552],["land",4589,4593],["bay",4655,4658],["trees",4753,4758],["house",4780,4785],["sea",4882,4885],["line",4908,4912],["head",5054,5058],["wood",5115,5119],["cottage",5135,5142],["point",5157,5162]],"pos_words":[["right",86,91],["variety",167,174],["works",227,232],["immense",310,317],["right",416,421],["enjoyed",596,603],["eminence",774,782],["variety",811,818],["pleasant",836,844],["sweetly",1522,1529],["eminence",1563,1571],["conveniently",1783,1795],["noble",1937,1942],["better",2048,2054],["excellent",2089,2098],["paradise",2240,2248],["well",2295,2299],["eminence",2424,2432],["improve",2549,2556],["noble",2640,2645],["modern",2684,2690],["elegantly",2827,2836],["good",2867,2871],["convenient",2876,2886],["pleasure",2952,2960],["improvement",2997,3008],["greatest",3030,3038],["variety",3055,3062],["sweet",3131,3136],["advantage",3161,3170],["judicious",3219,3228],["work",3281,3285],["wonders",3286,3293],["well",3302,3306],["genius",3322,3328],["picturesque",3447,3458],["magnificent",3498,3509],["pleasing",3583,3591],["variety",3709,3716],["noble",3781,3786],["fine",4089,4093],["rich",4109,4113],["variety",4307,4314],["sweet",4335,4340],["picturesque",4678,4689],["elegant",4949,4956],["excellent",4973,4982],["right",5019,5024],["beauty",5166,5172]],"neg_words":[["ruins",441,446],["rocky",768,773],["steep",1171,1176],["rocky",1557,1562],["dismal",1747,1753],["dungeon",1754,1761],["falls",2449,2454],["broken",3809,3815],["mist",4625,4629],["failing",4733,4740],["breaking",4895,4903],["steep",5109,5114]],"events":[],"dates":[["forty",346,351],["a fine",1092,1098],["a fine",1279,1285],["a fine",1422,1428],["a fine",1808,1814],["annual",1853,1859],["monday",1975,1981],["the 24th",1988,1996],["October",2000,2007],["two whole weeks",2023,2038],["about four years ago",2121,2141],["a fine",2417,2423],["a fine",3648,3654],["a fine",4860,4866]],"times":[["twenty four hours",390,407],["the morning",1584,1595]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",302,306],["behind",742,748],["behind",943,949],["behind",1389,1395],["within",3119,3125],["between",4023,4030],["left",4465,4469]],"spa_preps":[["under",248,253],["under",917,922],["within",1129,1135],["across",1185,1191],["under",1292,1297],["over",1324,1328],["beyond",4158,4164],["into",4191,4195],["above",4230,4235],["between",4425,4432],["beyond",4578,4584],["through",4607,4614],["through",4741,4748],["under",4814,4819],["under",5087,5092]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0758196721,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986737967},{"para_id":60,"paragraph":"There is a great variety of pleasing views from the different meandering walks and seats in the wood: At the moss-house, and the seat in the bottom of the wood, where Ulverston and the environs make a pretty picture.

When you are opposite to the peninsula last described take in at a gate on the left hand, and from the rocky eminence you have a general view of the lake both ways. To the south a sweet bay is formed between the horns of two peninsulas, and beyond that a fine sheet of water appears, terminated by the promontories which form the straits through which the lake has its outlet. From that the coast is beautifully diversified by a number of green enimences, crowned with wood, and interspersed amongst them sequestered cottages, half concealed by tall yew trees; and above them a wave of rocky spiral mountains dressed in brown vegitation, form most romantic scenes. Between this and a wooded eminence, a green hill, cut into inclosures to the very top, in some parts patched with rock and little groves has a beautiful appearance, contrasted with the barren scenes on one hand, and the deep shade of a waving wood on the other. At the foot of this cultivated tract, and on the margin of the lake, a few white houses, partly concealed in a grove of yews, look like enchanted seats on a fairy ground. Behind these a barren bleak mountain frowns in sullen majesty, and down his furrowed side the Black Beck or Torver rolls with mighty noise. Just at your feet lies the oblong rocky isle of Peel, and near it the dark points of half drowned rocks just shew themselves by turns. Here is the finest picture of the lake, and when it is smooth, the whole is seen reflected on the shining surface of the watery mirror. On the western side, the coast is steep rocks; the eastern side is much embayed. The high end of the lake is here in view, yet it seems to wind both ways behind the opposite promontories. The range of naked rocks, that cross the head of the lake, appear now awful from their sable hue, and behind the, the immense mass of Cove, Rydal Head, and many nameless mountains, have a most stupendous appearance, and inaccessible height. A succession of pretty bays opens to the traveller as he advances; the banks become more wooded, and more cultivation appears.

Here all that is great and pleasing on the lake, all that is grand and sublime in the environs, lie in a beautiful order, and natural disposition. Looking down upon the lake, the four large islands appear distinctly over the peninsula of Stable Hills; the Lord's Island richly dressed in wood; a little to the left, Vicar's Isle rises in a beautiful form, and a circular isle. Ramps Holme, is catched in the line betwixt that and St. Herbert's Island, which traverses the lake in an oblique direction, and has a fine effect. These are the four most considerable islands on the lake. Under Foe Park, a round hill completely clothed in wood, two small isles interrupt the line of shore, and charm the eye in the passage from the Vicar's Isle to Ramps Holme. Another islet above St. Herbert's Island, has a similar effect. All idea of river or outlet is here excluded; but over a neck of undulated land, finely scattered with trees, distant water is just seen behind the Lord's Island. The white church of Crosthwaite is seen under Skiddaw towering to the sky, the strongest possible back-ground. The opposite shore is bounded by a range of hills, down to the entrance of Newland vale, where Cawsey Pike and Thornthwaite rise in Alpine pride, outdone only by their supreme lord, Skiddaw. Their skirts descend in gentle slopes, and end in cultivated grounds. The whole of the western coast is beautiful beyond what words can express, and the north end exhibits what is most gentle and pleasing in landscape. The southern extremity of the lake, is a violent contrast to all this: Falcon Crag, an immense rock, hangs over your head, and upwards a forest of broken pointed rocks in a semicircular sweep, towering inward, form the most horrid ampitheatre that ever eye beheld, in all the wild forms of convulsed nature. The immediate border of the lake, is a sweet variegated shore of meadow and pasture, up to the foot of the rocks. Over a border of hedge-row trees, Lowdore House is seen under Hallow Stone Crag, a sloping rock whose back is covered with soft vegetation; beyond that, the awful craggy rocks that conceal the pass into Borrowdale, and at their feet a stripe of verdant meadows, through which the Derwent serpentizes to the lake in silence.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Stable Hills",99,111],["Wallow Crag",133,144],["Stable Hills",577,589],["Lord's Island",595,608],["Vicar's Isle",655,667],["Holme",722,727],["St. Herbert's Island",769,789],["Park",932,936],["Vicar's Isle",1066,1078],["Holme",1088,1093],["St. Herbert's Island",1115,1135],["Lord's Island",1307,1320],["Crosthwaite",1342,1353],["Skiddaw",1368,1375],["Newland",1508,1515],["Pike",1535,1539],["Thornthwaite",1544,1556],["Skiddaw",1615,1622],["Falcon Crag",1914,1925],["Lowdore",2299,2306],["Crag",2340,2344],["Borrowdale",2468,2478],["Derwent",2545,2552]],"geonouns":[["station",21,28],["line",79,83],["shore",87,92],["gate",193,197],["edge",206,210],["common",218,224],["rock",277,281],["mountain",312,320],["lake",382,386],["lake",508,512],["islands",529,536],["wood",627,631],["isle",710,714],["line",747,751],["lake",811,815],["islands",901,908],["lake",916,920],["hill",946,950],["wood",973,977],["isles",989,994],["line",1009,1013],["shore",1017,1022],["river",1171,1176],["outlet",1180,1186],["land",1234,1238],["trees",1262,1267],["water",1277,1282],["church",1332,1338],["ground",1425,1431],["shore",1446,1451],["hills",1477,1482],["entrance",1496,1504],["vale",1516,1520],["slopes",1655,1661],["grounds",1685,1692],["coast",1719,1724],["landscape",1832,1841],["lake",1873,1877],["rock",1938,1942],["head",1960,1964],["forest",1980,1986],["rocks",2005,2010],["lake",2179,2183],["shore",2207,2212],["meadow",2216,2222],["foot",2246,2250],["rocks",2258,2263],["trees",2292,2297],["rock",2356,2360],["rocks",2435,2440],["pass",2458,2462],["feet",2493,2497],["meadows",2518,2525],["lake",2572,2576]],"pos_words":[["right",122,127],["great",356,361],["pleasing",366,374],["grand",400,405],["sublime",410,417],["beautiful",444,453],["richly",609,615],["beautiful",679,688],["charm",1028,1033],["finely",1240,1246],["strongest",1401,1410],["pride",1572,1577],["outdone",1579,1586],["supreme",1601,1608],["gentle",1648,1654],["beautiful",1728,1737],["gentle",1809,1815],["pleasing",1820,1828],["immense",1930,1937],["sweet",2190,2195],["soft",2388,2392]],"neg_words":[["lie",435,438],["oblique",822,829],["interrupt",995,1004],["violent",1884,1891],["hangs",1944,1949],["broken",1990,1996],["horrid",2067,2073],["wild",2119,2123],["hedge",2282,2287],["awful",2422,2427]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",849,855]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",170,174],["without",181,188],["left",649,653],["here",1190,1194],["upwards",1970,1977],["beyond",2405,2411]],"spa_preps":[["along",69,74],["over",154,158],["into",291,295],["down",494,498],["over",555,559],["round",940,945],["above",1109,1114],["over",1209,1213],["behind",1296,1302],["under",1362,1367],["opposite",1437,1445],["down",1484,1488],["beyond",1738,1744],["over",1950,1954],["under",2321,2326],["into",2463,2467],["through",2527,2534]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0431372549,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986873269},{"para_id":134,"paragraph":"The road is along Barrowside, on the margin of the lake, open and narrow, yet safe.

All are thrown into some path of beauty, or line of nature.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Castle Crag",54,65],["Borrowdale",107,117],["Derwent",137,144],["Lowdore",270,277],["Castle Crag",413,424],["Borrowdale",428,438],["Langdale",594,602],["Pike",603,607]],"geonouns":[["stream",173,179],["winding",186,193],["meadows",215,222],["coast",245,250],["lake",262,266],["lake",283,287],["shore",357,362],["islands",400,407],["forest",464,470],["rocks",484,489],["heads",504,509],["head",647,651],["vale",715,719],["line",746,750],["roads",764,769],["mountains",795,804],["path",872,876],["line",891,895]],"pos_words":[["variety",346,353],["shine",529,534],["like",546,550],["like",642,646],["beauty",880,886]],"neg_words":[["rocky",93,98],["rocky",239,244],["embattled",474,483]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",84,88],["through",119,126],["through",194,201],["over",706,710],["round",785,790],["into",862,866]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0240963855,"vader_sentiment":0.81,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981546998},{"para_id":156,"paragraph":"To describe every picturesque view, that this region of landscape presents would be endless labour; and did language furnish expression to convey ideas of the innumerable changes, in the many grand constituent objects in these magnificent scenes, the imagination would be fatigued with the detail, and description weakened by redundancy.

The point for viewing this uncommon scene, is directly over the Alpine bridge, which hangs gracefully over the river. The town of Keswick appears no where to greater advantage than from this station. Helvellyn, in front, overlooks a vast range of varied hills, whose rocky sides are rent with many fissures, the paths of so many roaring rills and cataracts, that echo through the vales, and swell the general torment. To the east Cros Fell is discerned, like a cloud of blue mist, hanging over the horizon. In the middle space Mell Fell, a green pyramidal hill, is a singular figure. The eye wandering over Castle Rigg, will discover the druid-temple on the southern side of the Penrith road. Return to the path that leads down the ridge of the hill to the east; arrive at a gate that opens into a cross road; descend to the right, along the precipitous bank of a brawling brook, Glenderaterra Beck, that is heard tumbling from the mountain, concealed by woods that hang on the steep banks; in the course of the descent, remark Threskield Pike, browned with storms, and rent by a dreadful wedge-like rock, that tends to the centre. There are many pastoral cots and rural seats, scattered round the cultivated skirts of the mountains of Skiddaw, and Saddle Back, on this side sweetly placed and picturesque. The northern side is less hospitable, being more precipitous, and much concealed in shade. From the bridge the road leads to Threskield, and falls into the Penrith road four miles from Keswick. The last brook Glenderaterra, divides Skiddaw from Saddle Back, called here Threskield Fell. From the front of Mr. Wren's house, the eye will be delighted with the vale of St. John, sweetly spread out in rural beauty between two ridges of hills; Lothwaite and Naddle Fells, which in appearance lock just behind the Castle Rocks, these have the shew of magnificent ruins, in the centre point of view. A river is seen on both sides of the vale, lengthening its course in meanders, till it meets Threskield Water or Glenderamackin Beck at New Bridge, where it takes the name of Greeta. This picture is improved at the brow of the hill, on the western side of the house. Here the Greeta is seen from the bridge, running under the hill where you stand, and on the right, comes forth in a fine stream in a deep channel, between steep wooded banks. In a field on the left, near the second mile-post, stands conspicuous the wide circus of rude stones, the awful remains of the barbarous superstition of ancient times. Mr. Pennant has an excellent drawing of these druidical remains.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Greeta",220,226],["Keswick",564,571],["Helvellyn",634,643],["Mell Fell",961,970],["Castle",1041,1047],["Penrith",1113,1120],["Glenderaterra",1314,1327],["Threskield",1462,1472],["Pike",1473,1477],["Skiddaw",1670,1677],["Threskield",1866,1876],["Penrith",1897,1904],["Keswick",1926,1933],["Glenderaterra",1950,1963],["Skiddaw",1973,1980],["Threskield",2011,2021],["St. John",2107,2115],["Lothwaite",2181,2190],["Naddle Fells",2195,2207],["Castle Rocks",2250,2262],["Threskield Water",2428,2444],["Greeta",2510,2516],["Greeta",2611,2617]],"geonouns":[["gate",14,18],["wall",94,98],["precipice",157,166],["channel",253,260],["point",438,443],["bridge",505,511],["river",545,550],["town",556,560],["station",625,632],["hills",688,693],["paths",746,751],["cataracts",781,790],["vales",814,819],["horizon",932,939],["hill",990,994],["road",1121,1125],["path",1141,1145],["ridge",1166,1171],["hill",1179,1183],["gate",1209,1213],["road",1238,1242],["bank",1288,1292],["brook",1307,1312],["mountain",1366,1374],["woods",1389,1394],["banks",1418,1423],["rock",1534,1538],["seats",1605,1610],["mountains",1657,1666],["bridge",1841,1847],["road",1852,1856],["road",1905,1909],["brook",1944,1949],["house",2057,2062],["vale",2099,2103],["ridges",2164,2170],["hills",2174,2179],["point",2320,2325],["river",2337,2342],["vale",2372,2376],["brow",2550,2554],["hill",2562,2566],["house",2595,2600],["bridge",2635,2641],["hill",2661,2665],["stream",2723,2729],["channel",2740,2747],["banks",2770,2775],["field",2782,2787],["post",2822,2826],["stones",2871,2877]],"pos_words":[["right",76,81],["rapid",266,271],["finest",372,378],["fancy",417,422],["gracefully",525,535],["advantage",600,609],["like",888,892],["leads",1151,1156],["right",1259,1264],["like",1529,1533],["sweetly",1709,1716],["picturesque",1728,1739],["hospitable",1767,1777],["leads",1857,1862],["delighted",2080,2089],["sweetly",2117,2124],["beauty",2145,2151],["magnificent",2287,2298],["improved",2534,2542],["right",2694,2699],["excellent",2964,2973]],"neg_words":[["noise",207,212],["hangs",519,524],["rocky",701,706],["fissures",732,740],["torment",843,850],["cloud",895,900],["mist",909,913],["precipitous",1276,1287],["hang",1400,1404],["steep",1412,1417],["dreadful",1514,1522],["wedge",1523,1528],["precipitous",1790,1801],["falls",1882,1887],["ruins",2299,2304],["steep",2757,2762],["conspicuous",2835,2846],["rude",2866,2870],["awful",2883,2888],["barbarous",2904,2913],["superstition",2914,2926]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",2716,2722]],"times":[["The last",1935,1943]],"distances":[["two miles",299,308],["four miles",1910,1920],["mile",2817,2821]],"loc_advs":[["there",168,173],["here",2006,2010],["behind",2239,2245],["left",2795,2799],["near",2801,2805]],"spa_preps":[["through",236,243],["over",489,493],["over",536,540],["through",802,809],["over",923,927],["over",1036,1040],["down",1157,1161],["into",1225,1229],["along",1266,1271],["round",1622,1627],["into",1888,1892],["out",2132,2135],["between",2152,2159],["under",2651,2656],["between",2749,2756]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9988063574},{"para_id":158,"paragraph":"Station Viii.

From Armathwaite the lower bay is in full display, a fine expanse of water, spreading itself both ways behind a circular peninsula, Castle How, that swells in the middle, and is crowned with wood. In former times it has been surrounded by water, from the lake on one side, and the assistance of a brook that descends from Embleton, on the other. The accessible parts have been defended by trenches, one above another. The upper part has been occupied with building, the vestiges of ruins are visible; and, like other such places in this region, were probably occupied by the first inhabitants, as places of difficult access, and of easy defence. From the bottom of the bay, some waving inclosures rise to the side of a green hill, and some scattered houses are seen at the upper end of a fine slope of inclosures. The banks of the lake are fringed with trees, and under them the crystal water is caught in a pleasing manner. At the north west corner the Derwent issues from the lake, and is spanned by a handsome stone bridge of three arches. The whole western boundary is the noble range of wooded hills, the Wythop brows. On the eastern shore, the lake retires behind a peninsula, that rushes far into the water, and on its extreme point, a solitary oak, waving to every wind, is most picturesque. This is Scarenses. The coast upward is a fine cultivated tract to the skirts of Skiddaw, which raises here in awful majesty his purple front.

Return to the road by Scareness, and descend from the house to the oak tree, on the extremity of the promontory. The lake is here narrowest but immediately spreading itself both ways, forms two semicircular bays; that on the right is a mile across, the bay on the left is smaller, the shore on both sides finely variegated with low wood and scattered bushes, especially the peninsula itself. The upper bay is perfectly circular and finely wooded. In front, Wythop brows rise swift from the water's edge; the extremity of some inclosures are picturesque, seen just over the wood, with part of a cottage; the village of Wythop lies behind it in an aerial site. A grass inclosure scooped in the bosom of the hanging wood, and under it, a cot, on the very brink of the lake, stands sweetly. The views downward are fine, the banks high and woody to the bridge, of which two arches are in sight; behind it a white house is charmingly placed. More to the right, at the head of a gentle slope, in the very centre of view, stands Armathwaite, winged with groves; and behind, at a small distance, are deep hanging woods, and over them, spreading far to the right and left, a great reach of cultivated grounds. This termination is rich and pleasing to the eye. The view to the south is, as on the upper lake, much softned by distance.

In approaching the head of Newland Hawse, on the left, a mountain of purple coloured rock presents a thousand gaping chasms, excavated by torrents that roaring fall into a bason, formed in the bosom of the mountain, and thence precipitating over a wall of rock, become a brook below. In front is a vast rocky mountain, the barrier of the dell, that opposes itself to all further access. Among the variety of water-falls that distinguish this awful boundary of rock, one catches the eye at a distance, that exceeds the boasted Lowdore, as much as Cawsey Pike does Castle Rigg, in height of rock, and unity of fall; whilst the beholder is free from all anxiety of mind in the approach; not one pebble or grain of sand offends, but all is nature in her sweetest trim of verdant turf, spread out to please her votaries.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Rowlingend",165,175],["Keswick",249,256],["Gasgadale",664,673],["Newland",694,701],["Newland",1330,1337],["Hawse",1338,1343],["Lowdore",1829,1836],["Pike",1856,1860],["Castle",1866,1872]],"geonouns":[["road",4,8],["brook",67,72],["channel",100,107],["water",113,118],["tree",154,158],["mountain",186,194],["vale",241,245],["road",262,266],["vale",377,381],["hill",401,405],["vale",454,458],["hills",494,499],["mountains",538,547],["tower",554,559],["houses",684,690],["vale",818,822],["dell",837,841],["road",847,851],["path",854,858],["regions",954,961],["mountains",1172,1181],["head",1322,1326],["mountain",1360,1368],["rock",1388,1392],["mountain",1509,1517],["wall",1551,1555],["rock",1559,1563],["brook",1574,1579],["mountain",1612,1620],["dell",1641,1645],["water",1711,1716],["falls",1717,1722],["rock",1763,1767],["rock",1892,1896]],"pos_words":[["rapid",52,57],["clear",119,124],["pleasing",220,228],["gentle",273,279],["variety",576,583],["variety",786,793],["fantastic",797,806],["grandeur",1096,1104],["charming",1235,1243],["genius",1275,1281],["variety",1700,1707],["exceeds",1809,1816],["unity",1902,1907],["free",1940,1944]],"neg_words":[["hedge",144,149],["awful",526,531],["rude",533,537],["grotesque",587,596],["murky",617,622],["hang",638,642],["solemn",1059,1065],["gloom",1086,1091],["dreary",1108,1114],["fall",1463,1467],["rocky",1606,1611],["awful",1745,1750],["fall",1911,1915],["anxiety",1954,1961]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["The morning",1125,1136]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["below",323,328],["left",1352,1356]],"spa_preps":[["through",15,22],["along",32,37],["down",87,91],["under",159,164],["into",415,419],["down",445,449],["amidst",1075,1081],["into",1468,1472],["over",1544,1548],["below",1580,1585],["out",2091,2094]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.28,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986073375},{"para_id":197,"paragraph":"Whoever would enjoy, with ease and safety, Alpine views, and pastoral scenes in the sublime stile, may have them in this morning ride.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["enjoy",14,19],["ease",26,30],["sublime",84,91]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["this morning",116,128]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.2142857143,"vader_sentiment":0.82,"roberta_sentiment":0.998822391},{"para_id":198,"paragraph":"The road, or rather tract becomes less agreeable for a few roods, not from any difficulty in the finest mountain turf, where roads may be made at the least expence, but from the dulness of the dalesmen, who habituate themselves to tread in the tract made by their flocks.

A station here would be an efficacious check on any body of the enemy that might cross the estuaries, above or below Boulness, and pass the watch there, and the garrisons at old Carlisle, Ellenborough, Papcastle, and Moresby; for it was impossible for any body of men to proceed to the south but by Borrowdale or Dunmail Raise, and a garrison at Keswick commanded both these passes. The watch at Caer Mot would give the alarm to that on Castle Crag, in the pass of Borrowdale, and the centinel on Castlet Head that overlooks Keswick, would communicate the same to the garrison there; so it is apparently impossible that any body of men could pass that way. But if they attempted a rout on the northern side of Skiddaw, and over Hutton Moor to Patterdale, the watch at Caer Mot was in sight, both of old Carlisle and Keswick, and the garrison of the latter might either pursue, or give notice to Whitbarrow and Ambleside, to meet them in the pass at the head of Patterdale, called Kirkston, which is so steep and narrow, and crowded with rocks, that a few veteran troops would easily stop the career of a tumultuous crowd, who falling back upon each other, would increase their destruction, in flying down a precipitous pass; if they made good the pass, and turned to the east before the Romans arrived, they would in that case be harassed in the rear, till they arrived at Kendal, where the watchment from Water Crook would be ready to receive them, and then they would be attacked in front and rear. That the Romans have had engagements at Kirkston pass, is evident from the Roman arms that were lately found in the ajoining moss; there are also many heaps of stones collected, which have the appearance of barrows.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",52,60],["Penrith,",86,94],["Brougham Castle",112,127],["Keswick",153,160],["Ambleside",215,224],["Moresby",230,237],["Penrith",255,262],["Moresby",267,274],["Carlisle",311,319],["Papcastle",325,334],["Moresby",350,357],["Castle",390,396],["Keswick",461,468],["Greeta",532,538],["Derwent",543,550],["Papcastle",635,644],["Boulness",830,838],["Carlisle",891,899],["Ellenborough",901,913],["Papcastle",915,924],["Moresby",930,937],["Borrowdale",1012,1022],["Dunmail Raise",1026,1039],["Keswick",1059,1066],["Castle Crag",1150,1161],["Borrowdale",1178,1188],["Castlet",1210,1217],["Keswick",1238,1245],["Skiddaw",1423,1430],["Patterdale",1456,1466],["Carlisle",1516,1524],["Keswick",1529,1536],["Whitbarrow",1608,1618],["Ambleside",1623,1632],["Patterdale",1674,1684],["Kirkston",1693,1701],["Kendal",2086,2092],["Kirkston",2254,2262]],"geonouns":[["station",4,11],["station",184,191],["station",370,377],["station",418,425],["town",453,457],["rivers",525,531],["station",715,722],["estuaries",804,813],["pass",844,848],["passes",1088,1094],["pass",1170,1174],["pass",1355,1359],["pass",1654,1658],["head",1666,1670],["rocks",1750,1755],["pass",1932,1936],["pass",1960,1964],["pass",2263,2267],["stones",2374,2380]],"pos_words":[["convenient",481,491],["better",658,664],["efficacious",740,751],["good",1951,1955],["ready",2140,2145]],"neg_words":[["enemy",777,782],["impossible",950,960],["alarm",1133,1138],["impossible",1317,1327],["steep",1715,1720],["crowded",1737,1744],["tumultuous",1817,1827],["falling",1839,1846],["destruction",1890,1901],["precipitous",1920,1931],["harassed",2043,2051]],"events":[],"dates":[["three quarters",32,46],["five and a quarter",62,80],["The summer",359,369],["the winter",407,417]],"times":[],"distances":[["twelve miles",15,27]],"loc_advs":[["between",207,214],["between",243,250],["here",621,625],["here",723,727],["above",815,820],["there",859,864],["there",1290,1295],["there",2345,2350]],"spa_preps":[["about",95,100],["about",133,138],["between",292,299],["between",335,342],["below",824,829],["over",1436,1440],["down",1913,1917]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0297029703,"vader_sentiment":-0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9958106279},{"para_id":221,"paragraph":"These are the only passes amongst the mountains, that a body of Calendonians could attempt in their way to the south, and these could not be secured without a station at Keswick, and that could not be more advantageously placed, than were the town stands, on the meeting of the roads from the surrounding stations, all about an equal distance, and at such a distance as rendered a station here necessary, and the several castellums, on Castle Crag, and Castle Hill, and Castlet, useful in giving notice, and guarding these important posts. That no vestige is now visible of a station ever being here, nor any notice taken of it by Camden, Horsley, and others, nor even a traditional record of its existence, are seeming difficulties, which put the negative on what has been advanced. That no vestiges remain only proves that the place had been defaced at an early period, when no care was taken to preserve the memory of such remains, and that the town occupies the whole area of the station, and that the station had been placed within the site of the town, probably in the lower part, facing the pass of the Greeta. In the wheel of the Greeta, a meadow peninsulated by the river, just below the town, and called the Goats Field, there are vestiges of a foss, but too imperfect to draw a conclusion from, in favour of the station. The ground round the town is very fertile, and has been long enough cultivated to destroy any remains; what have been accidentally discovered are gone into oblivion, and no change happening in the town itself to occasion new discoveries, the memory of what has been is fled with time. If Camden visited Keswick, he was satisfied with the then present state of the\" little town, which King Edward I. made a market.\" The face of the country only drew his attention. The Horsley never visisted these parts is evident, from his mistaken account of the road from Plumpton Wall to Keswick, which he says passed through Graystock Park this, had he but seen the face of the country, he could never had imagined. His mistake, and Camden's silence, gave occasion to a regular survey of the said road, and finding the military roads from Papcastle, Elenborough, Moresby, Ambleside, and Plumpton, all concide at Keswick, and for the other reasons already assigned, it appeared evident that a station must be some where near. The Castle Hill above Keswick, is a faithful record of the existence of a station in this country. Here was the seat of the ancient lords of the manor by Derwent Water, probably raised on the ruins of the Roman fortress: But after the heiress of that family was married to Ratcliff's, the family seat was removed into Northumberland, and the castle went to ruins; and with the stones thereof the Ratcliffs built a house of pleasure in one of the islands of Derwent Water. The name Castle Hill, being more ancient that the last erection is still retained. At Ambleside when I enquired for the Roman station, a few years ago, no one could inform me, but upon one person considering the description I gave of it, answered, It is the castle. The station at Plumpton is called by the same name; and at Kendal, the castellum that overlooks the station, is also called the Castle Steads. So here the Castle Hill, is the place of the summer station, but being a fruitful tract, and much plowed, I have not been able to trace any appearance of a foss or vallum, and therefore the whole of this conjecture must rest upon the necessity, or at least on the expediency of a station here. Since the writing of the above, in a field below the town, an urn with other remains was found by the plow, and said to be Roman.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Keswick",170,177],["Castle Crag",436,447],["Castle",453,459],["Castlet",470,477],["Horsley",639,646],["Greeta",1110,1116],["Greeta",1138,1144],["Keswick",1635,1642],["Horsley",1800,1807],["Plumpton",1890,1898],["Keswick",1907,1914],["Graystock",1945,1954],["Park",1955,1959],["Papcastle",2159,2168],["Elenborough",2170,2181],["Moresby",2183,2190],["Ambleside",2192,2201],["Plumpton",2207,2215],["Keswick",2232,2239],["Castle",2349,2355],["Keswick",2367,2374],["Derwent Water",2499,2512],["Northumberland",2663,2677],["Derwent Water",2802,2815],["Castle",2826,2832],["Ambleside",2903,2912],["Plumpton",3098,3106],["Kendal",3142,3148],["Castle",3211,3217],["Castle",3238,3244]],"geonouns":[["passes",19,25],["mountains",38,47],["station",159,166],["town",243,247],["roads",278,283],["stations",305,313],["station",381,388],["posts",533,538],["station",576,583],["town",948,952],["station",984,991],["station",1006,1013],["town",1053,1057],["pass",1098,1102],["meadow",1148,1154],["river",1175,1180],["town",1197,1201],["station",1323,1330],["ground",1336,1342],["town",1353,1357],["town",1529,1533],["town",1704,1708],["market",1738,1744],["country",1763,1770],["road",1880,1884],["country",1998,2005],["road",2117,2121],["roads",2148,2153],["station",2312,2319],["station",2419,2426],["country",2435,2442],["seat",2457,2461],["seat",2641,2645],["castle",2687,2693],["stones",2722,2728],["house",2759,2764],["islands",2791,2798],["station",2943,2950],["castle",3075,3081],["station",3087,3094],["station",3183,3190],["station",3278,3285],["station",3506,3513],["field",3557,3562],["town",3573,3577]],"pos_words":[["advantageously",206,220],["useful",479,485],["important",523,532],["advanced",774,782],["proves",813,819],["favour",1309,1315],["fertile",1366,1373],["enough",1393,1399],["satisfied",1651,1660],["faithful",2381,2389],["pleasure",2768,2776],["fruitful",3299,3307]],"neg_words":[["difficulties",720,732],["negative",748,756],["vestiges",792,800],["vestiges",1241,1249],["imperfect",1269,1278],["destroy",1414,1421],["mistaken",1856,1864],["mistake",2040,2047],["ruins",2537,2542],["ruins",2702,2707]],"events":[],"dates":[["an early period",855,870],["the\"",1692,1696],["a few years ago",2952,2967],["the summer",3267,3277]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",149,156],["here",389,393],["here",595,599],["there",1231,1236],["near",2339,2343],["here",3229,3233],["here",3514,3518]],"spa_preps":[["amongst",26,33],["about",319,324],["within",1030,1036],["below",1187,1192],["round",1343,1348],["into",1483,1487],["through",1937,1944],["above",2361,2366],["into",2658,2662],["above",3545,3550],["below",3563,3568]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0065359477,"vader_sentiment":-0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.99751544},{"para_id":222,"paragraph":"Nicholeson's hist. of Cumber. page 86.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.38,"roberta_sentiment":-0.8548417091},{"para_id":223,"paragraph":"Ulls Water.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Ulls Water",0,10]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9979807734},{"para_id":224,"paragraph":"Those who do no chuse to go as far as Penrith, may, near the eighth mile-post turn off to the right; Mell Fell, a round green hill, will be on the left to Matterdale; and into Gowbarrow Park, which brings them upon Ulls Water, about the middle part of it, where it is seen to great advantage.

Farther on, Hutton St. John, a castle-like old mansion of Mr. Huddleston's. Approach Dunmallet, a fine pointed hill, covered with wood. Began to mount the hill, and with some toil, gained the summit. From hence saw the lake opening directly at my feet, majestic in its calmness, clear and smooth as a blue mirror, with winding shores, and low point of land, covered with green inclosures, white farm houses looking out among the trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almost every where bordered with cultivated lands, gently sloping upwards, from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, till they reach the feet of the mountains, which rise very rude and awful with their broken tops on either hand. Directly in frout, at better than three miles distance, Place Fell, one of the bravest among them, pushes its bold broad breast into the midst of the lake, and forces it to alter its course, forming first a large bay to the left, and then bending to the right. Descended Dunmallet by a side avenue, only not perpendicular, and came to Barton Bridge over the Eamon. Then walked through a path in the wood, round the bottom of the hill, came forth where the Eamon issues out of the lake, and continued my way along the western shore, close to the water, and generally on a level with it; it is nine miles long, and at widest under a mile in breadth. After extending itself three miles and a half in a line to the south west, it turns at the foot of Place Fell, almost due west, and is here not twice the breadth of the Thames at London. It is soon again interrupted by the root of Helvellyn, a lofty and very rugged mountain, and spreading again, turns off to the south east, and is lost among the deep recesses of hills.

In Whinfield Park are the Countes Pillar, the White Hart Tree, and the Three Brother Tree. The first is a filial tribute of Ann Countess Dowager of Pembroke, to the memory of her pious mother, Mary Countess Dowager of Cumberland; the others are the remains of aged oak, that have long outlived their own strength; one of them is upwards of nine yards in circumference. Brougham castle is an awful ruin, the Brovoniacum of the Romans, and since that the bulwark of Westmorland on that side, and the pride of its earls, for many descents. In a gallery overhead, is a stone with a Roman sepulchral inscription, much defaced. At Little Salkeld is the largest druidical circle in the northern parts. Near Eamont Bridge is Arthur's Round Table and at a small distance from it, is Mayborough, both of remote antiquity, and doubtful use. The first may be presumed to have been a place of public exhibition for martial exercises, and the latter has the conditions of a British fort; but the rude pillar inclines some to believe it the remains of a druid temple. It is entirely formed of loose stones and pebbles, collected from the adjacent rivers and fields; that the height has once been great, may be collected from the vast breadth of the base, encreased by the fall of stones from the top; it incloses a circular area of 80 yards of more, and near the middle stands a red stone, upwards of three yards high; the entrance is on the eastern side, and opens to a sweet view of Brougham House, to which the rude pillar, when whitened,( and of this Mr. Brougham is very careful,) is a fine obelisk.

Such places the druids had, and were the public schools destined for the colloquial instruction of pupils in mysteries of religion, and the arcana of civil government.

The descendants of the said Walter De Strikland have lived at Sizergh, in this neighbourhood ever since, and this chapel is the family burial place.] In Parr's chapel is a third alter tomb in the corner, no figure or inscription, but on the side, cut in stone, an escutcheon of Ros of Kendal, three water-budgets, quartering Parr, two bars in a bordure engrailed, 2dly, an escutcheon, vaire, a fess for marmion; 3dly, an escutcheon, three chevronels braced, and a chief, which I take for Fitzhugh: At the foot is an escutcheon, surrounded with the garter, bearing Ros and Parr quarterly, quartering the other two beforementioned. I have no books to look in, therefore cannot lay whether this is Lord Parr of Kendal, Queen Catherine's father, or her brother the Marquis of Northampton. Perhaps it is a cenotaph for the latter who was buried at Warwick, 1571.\" The castle he describes thus. \" The remains, with four towers, two square and two round, but their upper part and embattlements are demolished: It is a rough stone and cement, without any ornament or arms, round, inclosing a court of the lake form, and surrounded by a moat; nor ever could it have been larger then it is, for there are no traces of out-works. There is a good view of the town and river, with a fertile open valley through which it winds.\" Had Mr. Gray ascended to the castle, which was the only way to it when in its glory, and is the easiest at present, he would have observed a square area that had been fortified with a deep moat, and connected to the castle by a draw-bridge, where was probably the base-court; the stones now are entirely removed and the ground leveled,\" and laughing Ceres reassumes the land.\" The present structure was undoubtedly raised by the first barons of Kendal and probably on the ruins of the Roman station; this being the most eligible site in the country for a summer encampment, and at a small distance from Water Crook. There are still some remains of a dark red freestone used in facings, and in the doors and windows, that has been brought from the environs of Penrith, more probably by the Romans, then either the Saxon or Norman lords. Fame says this castle held out against Oliver Cromwell, and was battered from the Castle Law-Hill, but this is not so probably, a that its present ruinous state is owing to the jealousy of the usurper.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[["Westmorland",681,692],["Burneside",744,753],["Helsington",860,870],["Richmond",914,922],["Strikland",1319,1328],["Furness",1601,1608],["Elizabeth",1639,1648],["Strikland",1803,1812],["Furness",1892,1899],["Westmorland",1919,1930],["Strikland",2050,2059],["Sizergh",2074,2081],["Kendal",2297,2303],["Kendal",2720,2726],["Northampton",2784,2795],["Warwick",2855,2862],["Kendal",3772,3778],["Penrith,",4086,4094],["Castle",4245,4251]],"geonouns":[["town",31,35],["church",90,96],["castle",101,107],["town",145,149],["house",168,173],["church",220,226],["tower",270,275],["isles",320,325],["chapels",352,359],["church",426,432],["chapels",503,510],["church",588,594],["chapel",1109,1115],["chapel",1331,1337],["monuments",1357,1366],["chapel",2126,2132],["chapel",2172,2178],["stone",2266,2271],["water",2311,2316],["foot",2517,2521],["castle",2875,2881],["towers",2926,2932],["stone",3029,3034],["lake",3109,3113],["town",3259,3263],["river",3268,3273],["valley",3295,3301],["castle",3356,3362],["castle",3543,3549],["bridge",3560,3566],["stones",3607,3613],["ground",3647,3653],["land",3697,3701],["station",3818,3825],["country",3868,3875],["doors",4024,4029],["castle",4178,4184]],"pos_words":[["handsome",159,167],["ease",481,485],["proper",568,574],["succeeded",1028,1037],["modern",1350,1356],["great",1729,1734],["works",3224,3229],["good",3242,3246],["fertile",3282,3289],["glory",3405,3410],["easiest",3423,3430]],"neg_words":[["injurious",47,56],["rough",3023,3028],["ruins",3799,3804],["dark",3977,3981],["battered",4227,4235],["ruinous",4310,4317],["jealousy",4340,4348],["usurper",4356,4363]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of the",130,144],["the 20th",826,834],["1577",1184,1188],["23d",1754,1757],["quarterly",2589,2598],["1571",2864,2868],["a summer",3880,3888]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",1948,1953],["without",3047,3054],["there",3197,3202]],"spa_preps":[["inside",412,418],["into",676,680],["between",1459,1466],["round",2953,2958],["round",3077,3082],["out",3220,3223],["through",3302,3309],["out",4190,4193],["against",4194,4201]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0072815534,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9917078614},{"para_id":275,"paragraph":"Brit. page 300.","file_id":"1778_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9976398945},{"para_id":276,"paragraph":"There is a most pleasant morning ride of five miles, own the east side of the river, Water Crook is one mile distant on the right, close by the side of the Kent. This is the Concangium of the Romans, where a body of the Vigilatores, watchmen, kept guard, and was the intermediate station betwixt the Dictis at Ambleside, and the garrison at Overborough; the line of the foss may be still traced, though much defaced by the plough; alters, coins, and inscribed stones have been found here, and in the wall of the barn, on the very area of the station, is still legible the inscription, preserved by Mr. Horsley to the memory of two freed-men with an imprecation against any one who should contaminate their sepulchre, with a fine to the fiscal. There is also an alter without an inscription, and a Silenus without a head. At a small distance is a pyramidal knowl crowned with a single tree called Sattury, where something dedicated to the God Saturn has stood. Pass through the village of Natland; on the crest of a green hill on the left, called Helm are the vestiges of a castellum called Castle Steads, which corresponded, by smoke in the day and flame in the night, with the garrison at Lancaster, by the beacon on Warton Crag, during the residence of the watchmen at Water Crook. There is a house at a distance to the north, called Wath House, where Roman coins have been found. Proceed through Sigiswick, and fall in with the course of the river at Force Bridge, and from the crown of it have a very singular romantic view both ways of the river, working its way in a narrow deep channel of rocks, hanging over it in a variety of forms, streaming a thousand limpid rills into the flood. The rocks in the bottom are strangely excavated into deep holes of various shapes, that when the river is low remain full of water; from its depth, black as ink. The bridge is one bold arch suspended by the opposite rocks, its antiquity unknown; a mantle of ivy vails its ancient front, and gives it a most venerable appearance. If you ride down the west side of the river from the bridge, as far as the forge, to see the water-fall of the whole river, its stream is much impaired in beauty since the forge was erected. But if from the end of the uppermost house, you will look up between two trees in the midst of the channel you will see the whole body of the river issuing from a sable cavern, and tumbling over a rock of height just sufficient to convert into froth as white as snow, and behind it, the arch of the bridge is partly catched in a disposition that forms a very uncommon assemblage of picturesque beauties. This is seen in highest perfection when the stream is full. Return to the bridge, and ride down the east side of the river to Levins Park.

The grounds in places are bold and hang to the river, or fall into gentle slopes, and decline into easy plains; all is variety with pleasing transition. Thickets cover the brows, ancient thorns, and more ancient oaks are scattered over the plain, and clumps, and solitary beach trees of enormous size, equal, if not surpass any thing the Chiltern Hills can boast. The park is well stocked with fallow-deer. The side of the Kent is famous for petrifying springs, that incrust vegetable bodies, as moss, leaves of trees,&amp; c. There is one in the park, called the dropping well. At a small distance is Hincaster, where the Romans had a camp, and from the name the Britons have called it the old camp. Within the park is Kirks Head, mentioned by Camden as a place frequented by the Romans, yet nothing of late belonging to that people has been discovered at either place. Levins House, was the seat of a family of that name for many ages, then of Redman for many descernts, afterwards it came to Bellingham, and Adam, or his son James Bellingham gave it the present form in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and in taste of carvings in wood attempted to outdo his contemporary, Walter Strikland of Sizergh Esq; after Bellingham it came to Colonel Graham, and from his daughter by marriage to the ancestor of the present noble possessor.

This is evident from an escutcheon cut in stone on the west side of the tower, and hung cornerwise, D' Aincourt quartering Stirkland, three escalop shells, the crest on a close helmet a full topt holly-bush.
