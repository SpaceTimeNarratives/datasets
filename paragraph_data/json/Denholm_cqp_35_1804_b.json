Amongst the number of those attending the Scotch warden was one of the Armstrongs, called Will of Kinmonth, a celebrated freebooter; against him the English held an inveterate hatred, from the many injuries they had received. After the breaking up of the commission, he was accordingly way-laid, when returning privately home, and carried to the castle of Carlisle, where he was put in irons. This circumstance coming to the ears of Scot of Buccleugh, one of the deputy-wardens of the border, he insisted upon restitution from the Governor of Carlisle: Finding his request disregarded, although in time of peace betwixt the nations, he determined to rescue Armstrong by force, and for this purpose called together a number of his followers, amounting to about 200 horse, the place of rendezvous being the tower of Morton, about ten miles from Carlisle. With these, during the night, he crossed the Esk, and about two hours before day arrived at the Eden, which was much swollen by some late rains. This river the party likewise crossed, at the hazard of their lives, and came to the Sacery, a plain under the castle. Here making a halt at the side of a rivulet, he caused 80 of the company to alight from their horses, with the ladders they had prepared for scaling. Accompanying them to the foot of the wall, he caused the ladders to be set against it; these, however, being found too short, a breach was ordered to be made with other instruments, nigh the Postern gate. This, with much labour, was effected, so as to admit a single person, who quickly thereafter broke open the postern for the others. The noise occasioned by this alarmed some watchmen; who were, quickly secured and taken prisoners. The other doors that led into the prisoner's apartment were in succession broken open, and Armstrong in consequence relieved, but no farther damage done, or captives taken, although the whole garrison now lay at their mercy. Having gained their object, they retreated by sound of trumpet, marching again by the Sacery to the banks of the river. In the meantime, the town was alarmed, numbers flocked together to oppose the Scots recrossing the river; their ranks were, however, broken, and Buccleugh and his party plunged into the Eden, landed safely on the opposite bank, and two hours after sun rise, crossed the border into Scottish ground, after having performed one of the most daring and hazardous enterprizes recorded in the history of the two nations-- an enterprize, which had nearly again involved them in war and bloodshed.","file_id":"1804_b","plnames":[["Elizabeth",35,44],["Carlisle",586,594],["Carlisle",773,781],["Carlisle",1073,1081],["Eden",1179,1183],["Eden",2464,2468]],"geonouns":[["line",151,155],["castle",576,582],["force",900,905],["tower",1035,1040],["river",1233,1238],["castle",1339,1345],["foot",1522,1526],["wall",1534,1538],["gate",1696,1700],["doors",1943,1948],["banks",2258,2263],["river",2271,2276],["town",2299,2303],["river",2377,2382],["bank",2500,2504],["ground",2569,2575]],"pos_words":[["amicable",214,222],["celebrated",340,350],["peace",836,841],["led",1954,1957],["mercy",2151,2156],["gained",2165,2171],["trumpet",2213,2220],["safely",2477,2483],["daring",2616,2622]],"neg_words":[["hatred",406,412],["breaking",466,474],["swollen",1200,1207],["hazard",1274,1280],["breach",1625,1631],["broke",1795,1800],["noise",1838,1843],["alarmed",1863,1870],["prisoner",1967,1975],["broken",2007,2013],["damage",2074,2080],["object",2178,2184],["retreated",2191,2200],["alarmed",2308,2315],["oppose",2345,2351],["broken",2411,2417],["hazardous",2627,2636],["bloodshed",2757,2766]],"events":[],"dates":[["march",163,168],["day",1160,1163],["80",1402,1404]],"times":[["the night",1102,1111],["about two hours",1137,1152],["two hours",2510,2519]],"distances":[["about ten miles",1052,1067]],"loc_advs":[["home",551,555],["together",935,943],["nigh",1679,1683],["together",2333,2341],["opposite",2491,2499]],"spa_preps":[["against",363,370],["about",984,989],["under",1329,1334],["against",1572,1579],["into",1958,1962],["into",2455,2459],["into",2555,2559]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0386266094,"vader_sentiment":-0.15,"roberta_sentiment":0.9939433932},{"para_id":40,"paragraph":"Besides the cathedral, or St. Mary's church, as it is called, Carlisle has another church upon the establishment, St. Cuthbert's, a modern edifice, built upon the situation of the old church of that name, in 1778, with a short spire and dome; 3 protestant dissenting meeting-houses, a quaker meeting-house, one for the methodists, and a Roman catholic chapel.","file_id":"1804_b","plnames":[["Carlisle",62,70],["Cuthbert",118,126]],"geonouns":[["church",37,43],["church",83,89],["church",184,190],["houses",275,281],["house",300,305],["chapel",352,358]],"pos_words":[["modern",132,138]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["1778",208,212],["3",243,244],["quaker",285,291]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0263157895,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9969558716},{"para_id":41,"paragraph":"The prison or jail of the city stands near the west end of the town; it is an old fabric, and its apartments dark and gloomy; within its limits, however, a considerable area or open space is included, inclosed with a wall of brick, where the prisoners are allowed to take exercise in the day, contrary to the custom in the Scotch jails, where the benefit of the free air is not allowed.","file_id":"1804_b","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["town",63,67],["wall",217,221]],"pos_words":[["benefit",347,354],["free",362,366]],"neg_words":[["prison",4,10],["dark",109,113],["gloomy",118,124],["limits",137,143]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",284,291]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["near",38,42],["within",126,132]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0540540541,"vader_sentiment":-0.23,"roberta_sentiment":0.9885591865},{"para_id":42,"paragraph":"A small part of this area is inclosed by an iron rail; it is appropriated for criminals, many of whom we saw walking up and down with chains, clashing at every step.
