But reader, consider that keen bracing breeze - You forget that its sharpness will hunger increase; Besides that our breakfast we hastened to seize on There was a complete and efficient reason Which will satisfy you, I'm sure, when' tis known. ' Twas gallantry and sympathy hurried us home. Would you leave a lady, and muffins all hot too, There waiting and wondering where we had got to?
