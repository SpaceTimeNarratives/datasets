On the left of this road is Skirsgill, the seat of Hugh Parkin, Esq.; and further on, to the right, is Dalemain, the sweetly secluded mansion of Edward Williams Hasell, Esq. In the reign of Henry the Second, Dalemain, Dominium in Valle, belonged to John de Morville; and it was possessed successively by his immediate descendants, Nigel de Morville, Walter de Morville, John de Morville, and Richard de Morville. In the 38th of Henry the Third, Sir Richard Layton was lord of the manor and of Auldby. In the time of Edward the second, it belonged to Thomas Layton; in that of Edward the Third, to William Layton; and in that of Henry the Sixth, to William Layton. It continued in the male line of this family till after the time of William Layton, Esq. who was sheriff of Cumberland in the 20th of Charles the Second. At his death, having five daughters and no son, he devised the same by will to trustees with directions that they should sell it for the benefit of his daughters.

Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, who lived in the latter part of queen Elizabeth's reign, was the last of the name who inhabited this hall. This Sir Lancelot was wont to observe, that' he had three noble houses: one for pleasure at Crosby in Westmorland, where he had a park full of deer; one for profit and warmth, in which to reside in winter, namely, at Yanwith, nigh Penrith; and the third well stocked with tenants and men to go with him to the wars, at Threlkeld, near Keswick.' He had three daughters, co-heiresses, the eldest of whom married Thomas Dudley, of a younger branch of the Dudleys of the south, and possessed Yanwath; the other two married two brothers, younger sons of Sir James Pickering of Killington, and had one Threlkeld, and the other Crosby Ravensworth. Christopher Dudley, the descendant of Thomas Dudley, was the last of that name that inhabited Yanwath Hall. As he had no issue living, he sold the manor of Yanwath and Eamont Bridge to Sir John Lowther, baronet, about the year 1654, reserving in it both his own and his wife's estate for life.

They sometimes weigh thirty or forty pounds; and Mr. Clarke mentions one which weighed fifty - six pounds; but their ordinary weight is from seven to twenty pounds each. They are found chiefly in the deepest part of the lake, below the island of House Holme; but they are sometimes, though seldom, taken in other parts, except in the month of October, which is their spawning season. During that month, nets are set across the foot of Goldril Beck, which they attempt to ascend for the purpose of spawning; a few make a similar attempt to ascend Glenridding Beck; but it is not known that any enter the other streams which flow into the lake. Some of these trouts escape the nets, and succeed in getting into the river; but in that case, they are generally killed by the farmers, who, during the darkness of the night, strike them with a spear by the light of a torch. ' This lordly creature,' observes Mr. Wordsworth,' seems to know that' eretiredness is a piece of majesty,'' for it is scarcely ever caught, or ever seen, except when it quits the depths of the lake in the spawning season, and runs up into the streams, where it is too often destroyed in disregard of the law of the land and nature.' Mr. Clarke, however, mentions that he killed with the rod one which weighed upwards of seven pounds; and in the summer of 1831, a grey trout, which weighed twelve pounds, was taken with the net in the lower part of the lake.

Yet, at the base of Birk Fell, and' along the craggy side of Place Fell, richly adorned with juniper, and sprinkled over with birches,' a narrow track conducts from Martindale to Patterdale, by the way of Sandwyke.","file_id":"1833_a","plnames":[["Birk Fell",63,72],["Birk Fell",181,190],["Place Fell",194,204],["Birk Fell",553,562],["Place Fell",594,604],["Martindale",698,708],["Patterdale",712,722],["Sandwyke",738,746]],"geonouns":[["mountain",4,12],["water",53,58],["edge",101,105],["lake",113,117],["wall",139,143],["mountain",147,155],["mountains",264,273],["lake",397,401],["outlet",411,417],["winding",421,428],["water",436,441],["shore",501,506],["hills",516,521],["crags",526,531],["track",678,683]],"pos_words":[["glorious",163,171],["richly",606,612]],"neg_words":[["steep",86,91],["broken",286,292],["irregular",298,307],["barren",357,363],["steep",510,515]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",20,24]],"spa_preps":[["along",569,574],["over",649,653]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0416666667,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9868919253},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"At the north end of Birk Fell are Sandwyke and Sandwyke Force.

Even after that period, it was a title frequently bestowed on persons of that description.

In Shakespeare's' Merry Wives of Windsor,' the tutor, Hugh Evans, is designated by the title of Sir Hugh; and in the registers of institution, in the different dioceses, this designation is frequently given. Mr. Machel says, that within his own memory,' all readers in chapels were called Sirs, and were anciently so designated in writing;' and hence he is of opinion, that such of the laity as received the order of knighthood, had, for the sake of distinction, the word' knight,' written after their names, otherwise this would have been superfluous.

' Stybarrow,' he observes,' is a huge rock on the west side of Ulswater, in the way to Barton and Penrith Here is a strait passage about two yards broad, having on one side a high hanging rock, which threatens to fall on passengers, and on the other a steep precipice into Ulswater, which, near this crag, is said to be about forty - eight yards in depth. A few men might defend this passage against a great army; and this actually took place in 1648, during the civil wars, when the Scottish army attempted to force their way into Patterdale. A few shepherds posted themselves in this strait, and boring a hole in an oak tree, which stood upon the brink of the lake, they drove a bar through it into the rock on the other side. In this situation, they so conducted themselves, that they diverted the Scottish army from their purpose, and obliged them to retire into the parish of Bampton. This account seems to corroborate the tradition, that the ancestors of Mr. Mounsey were distinguished by the name of kings of Patterdale, in consequence of a gallant action performed by one of the family; who, at the head of a few trusty shepherds, defeated at the pass of Stybarrow Crag a numerous band of Scottish marauders.

The Floating, or more properly, as Mr. Wordsworth thinks, the Buoyant Island is not visible in the plate. This island, which appears only occasionally, is situated in the south-east corner of the lake, about one hundred and fifty yards from the shore, and not far from Lowdore. It is sometimes visible for several weeks successively, and sometimes does not appear for several years. Usually, however, it is seen after an interval of a few years, and towards the conclusion of a warm summer. Being attached by its sides to the adjacent earth under water, it never changes its situation, but always makes its appearance in the same place. In extent it is sometimes half an acre, and sometimes only a few perches. It has risen seven times during the last twenty - five years, and appeared in the summers of 1824, 1825, and 1826. The uncommon circumstance of its appearing in three consecutive years, has been attributed to the extraordinary warmth of the summers. Various hypotheses have been offered, to account for the alternate rising and sinking of this island. The most probable opinion seems to be, that the vegetable matter of which the island is composed, produces by decomposition a quantity of gas. This gas being generated most copiously, as well as being more rarefied in hot weather, at length distends the earth so much as to render the mass of less weight than the same bulk of water. The island then rises to the surface where it continues till the gas is reduced, partly by absorption, and partly by condensation, consequent on a decrease of heat. In the body of the island a considerable quantity of air is contained, and this air, when dislodged, has been found to consist of equal parts of carburetted hydrogen and azotic gases, with a little carbonic acid.

By these religious it was still continued in its military capacity, to defend their valuable possessions in the vale of Borrowdale, against the predatory incursions of the Scots, who, in those days, frequently made irruptions even thus far into the country.

Here with great labour, he sank a shaft, which he carried diagonally till he entered the mine; and, with secret joy, he continued his depredations for some time undiscovered. At length, his fraud was detected, and he was tried at Carlisle. The peculiarity of the case saved his life; but in the year 1752, an act of parliament was passed to secure this valuable property. By this act, both the stealer and the receiver are subjected to the same punishment as for felony. In the preamble to the act, this mineral is described as necessary to the casting of bomb-shells, round shot and cannon-balls.

The name of the Rev. William Langhorne, who died in 1775, is still remembered with great respect. The late master, the Rev. John Bowstead, B.D., who presided over this school for more than half a century, retired from the situation a short time ago, on being collated to the rectory of Musgrave, by the present bishop of Carlisle. Independently of those who, after being instructed at this school, have entered the universities, very many who possessed not the means of obtaining a college education, have acquired here such a knowledge of the learned languages, as enabled them to fill situations of some distinction, with credit to themselves, and honour to those from whom they received their instruction. If it were not invidious, and unjust to those who are not mentioned, many names of living men who were educated at this school, and who are an honour to their profession, and highly useful to the community, might easily be adduced. Very many who were brought up at Bampton school, entered into the church, in which some of them continued in the humble situation of curates - a situation certainly of great respectability and usefulness, but comparatively of little advantage to themselves. Others of them, indeed, rose to a degree of eminence in their profession. But they were all the sons of yeomen, or of those who had little to spare for giving them a university education. Add to this, that not only those sons who were intended for some of the learned professions, but even those who were designed to manage the farm, and to succeed to the property of their ancestors, were all instructed alike, and alike received such an education as this school could bestow. By this means, knowledge was diffused through the whole family - nearly through the whole community; and it was no uncommon thing to find the son who tilled the ground, and him who was destined for a profession, equally learned and well informed. It was no uncommon thing to find yeoman who could read the New Testament in Greek, and who was acquainted with the best writers of the Augustine age.","file_id":"1833_a","plnames":[["Bampton",94,101],["Carlisle",521,529],["Bampton",1174,1181]],"geonouns":[["school",102,108],["school",368,374],["school",590,596],["school",1029,1035],["school",1182,1188],["church",1207,1213],["farm",1727,1731],["school",1856,1862],["ground",2038,2044]],"pos_words":[["masters",83,90],["eminent",156,163],["useful",175,181],["great",283,288],["respect",289,296],["master",307,313],["distinction",806,817],["educated",1012,1020],["useful",1091,1097],["humble",1254,1260],["great",1309,1314],["advantage",1374,1383],["eminence",1443,1451],["succeed",1740,1747],["well",2109,2113],["best",2239,2243]],"neg_words":[["died",244,248],["invidious",924,933],["unjust",939,945]],"events":[],"dates":[["1775",252,256],["half a century",389,403]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",715,719]],"spa_preps":[["over",358,362],["into",1198,1202],["through",1915,1922],["through",1949,1956]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0755813953,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980851412},{"para_id":113,"paragraph":"The era succeeding the Reformation gave birth to those institutions which have been the means of diffusing happiness and knowledge among the people of this country, and especially among the inhabitants of Westmorland and Cumberland.

But what is the case at the present time? Why, the young men who cannot obtain a university education are precluded, by certain regulations which have been adopted, from entering into the church. The consequence is, that much of the learning, - such learning as was formerly taught at the endowed schools in the counties of Westmorland and Cumberland - is now entirely neglected. All, or chiefly all, which is now taught, is confined to English and writing. This is a state of things which cannot be too much lamented. The effects of such an education may easily be foreseen. Besides preventing some of benefiting either themselves or their country, the probable effects will be to render the yeomanry and peasantry of these counties, in a short time, as ignorant as their brethren in the south.
