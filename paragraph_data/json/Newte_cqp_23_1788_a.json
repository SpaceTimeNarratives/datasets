Penrith is a neat well built little town. On an eminence are the remains of an old castle. The church is a very handsome and spacious building. In the church-yard there are two very remarkable stones, about eight feet high, and fifteen feet asunder, with three very curious ones between, put edgeways, and joined at the top. This, I suppose, has been the burying place of some antient warrior; but the antiquarians have not been able to decypher the inscription, or to trace the antiquity of the monument. On an high hill, to the north of the town, stands a watch-tower, or beacon, built entirely of stone, which commands a very distant view of all the country round, and was formerly intended to give the alarm of the approach of an enemy. To the north-east is a range of very high mountains, called Cross Fells, or the British Alps, on which the snow, in large quantities, is very visible. In some places, I am told, it remains all the year round. Dine at Penrith, and ride to Carlisle in the evening. The country between these two towns is very capable of cultivation, and actually undergoing rapid improvement. In this tract of country, there is much corn land; and, about Carlisle, there is a great extent of rich grazing land, on both sides of the River Eden, which runs by the town.","file_id":"1788_a","plnames":[["Penrith",21,28],["Alps",850,854],["Penrith,",979,987],["Carlisle",1000,1008],["Carlisle",1198,1206],["River Eden",1275,1285]],"geonouns":[["town",57,61],["castle",104,110],["church",116,122],["building",155,163],["church",172,178],["stones",214,220],["top",341,344],["monument",517,525],["hill",538,542],["town",564,568],["tower",585,590],["beacon",595,601],["stone",621,626],["country",674,681],["mountains",804,813],["country",1029,1036],["towns",1055,1060],["country",1153,1160],["land",1181,1185],["land",1248,1252],["town",1305,1309]],"pos_words":[["neat",34,38],["well",39,43],["eminence",69,77],["handsome",133,141],["spacious",146,154],["remarkable",203,213],["capable",1069,1076],["rapid",1117,1122],["improvement",1123,1134],["great",1219,1224],["rich",1235,1239]],"neg_words":[["asunder",262,269],["alarm",727,732],["enemy",755,760]],"events":[],"dates":[["Saturday, 18th June",0,19],["all the year",951,963]],"times":[["the evening",1012,1023]],"distances":[["about eight feet",222,238],["fifteen feet",249,261]],"loc_advs":[["there",184,189],["between",300,307],["there",1162,1167],["there",1208,1213]],"spa_preps":[["round",682,687],["round",964,969],["between",1037,1044],["about",1192,1197]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0695652174,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984471202},{"para_id":32,"paragraph":"Sunday, 19th June. Carlisle is a city of considerable extent, surrounded by a wall thirty feet high, which is going fast to decay. At the north end of the town stands the castle, the rudest heap of stones that were ever piled together by the industry of man. There are four old invalids who take care of the ammunition kept in it, of which there is a considerable quantity, and 500 stand of arms. On the walls are mounted thirty guns, from six to twenty - four pounders, and among these the guns with which the town was reduced in 1745, by the Duke of Cumberland. The ditch around the castle is a filthy stagnated pool. Between the old citadel or castle, and the walls and mote by which it is separated from the town, is a declining bank, on which there is a row of trees, planted by the hands of the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots, when a prisoner in Carlisle. There are many very good houses in this town, though, in general, it is very ill built, and exces sively dirty, from the circumstances of its being surrounded by a wall, and having only a few outlets. Over the river, which is pretty large, are thrown two very elegant bridges. The cathedral is an handsome old building, in the Gothic style; the stone of a brick-dust red, like the cathedral at Litchfield. Near this edifice there is a very modern church, which looks on the outside more like a ballroom than a place of worship.","file_id":"1788_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",19,27],["Cumberland",552,562],["Carlisle",853,861]],"geonouns":[["town",155,159],["castle",171,177],["stones",198,204],["walls",404,409],["town",511,515],["castle",585,591],["castle",647,653],["walls",663,668],["town",712,716],["bank",733,737],["trees",766,771],["houses",888,894],["town",903,907],["wall",1027,1031],["outlets",1055,1062],["river",1073,1078],["bridges",1131,1138],["building",1173,1181],["stone",1208,1213],["church",1310,1316]],"pos_words":[["fast",116,120],["good",883,887],["pretty",1089,1095],["elegant",1123,1130],["handsome",1160,1168],["like",1235,1239],["modern",1303,1309],["like",1350,1354]],"neg_words":[["decay",124,129],["filthy",597,603],["declining",723,732],["unfortunate",801,812],["prisoner",841,849],["dirty",968,973],["dust",1225,1229]],"events":[],"dates":[["Sunday, 19th June",0,17],["1745",531,535]],"times":[],"distances":[["a wall thirty feet",76,94]],"loc_advs":[["there",340,345],["there",748,753],["there",1287,1292]],"spa_preps":[["together",226,234],["among",475,480],["around",574,580],["outside",1337,1344]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0080645161,"vader_sentiment":0.57,"roberta_sentiment":-0.8555814028}]
