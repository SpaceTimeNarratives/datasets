He was on his way to Edinburgh, to deliver a lecture, or a course of lectures, and had called, he said, to talk with me about spiritualism, being[ 17] desirous of having the judgement of a sincere mind on the subject. In his own mind, I should suppose, he is past the stage of doubt and enquiry; for he told me that, in every section of his life, he is governed by the councels received from the spiritual world, through a medium. I did not inquire whether the medium has suggested his visit to me. The medium is a small boy. My remarks to him were quite of a sceptical character, in regard to the faith to which he has surrendered himself. It seems he has lived in America, in times past, and had a son born there. He gave me a pamphlet written by himself, on the cure of consumption and other diseases by antiseptic remedies. The author's name is Dr. Washington Evans. I hope he will not bore me any more, though he seems to be a very sincere and good man; but these enthusiasts, who adopt such extravagant ideas, appear to me to lack imagination, instead of being misled by it, as they are generally supposed to be.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Edinburgh",180,189],["America",825,832]],"geonouns":[["door",30,34]],"pos_words":[["sociable",81,89],["desirous",310,318],["sincere",348,355],["spiritual",555,564],["regard",743,749],["faith",757,762],["cure",924,928],["sincere",1096,1103],["good",1108,1112]],"neg_words":[["doubt",436,441],["sceptical",719,728],["bore",1049,1053],["extravagant",1156,1167],["lack",1191,1195]],"events":[],"dates":[["The day",0,7],["17",306,308]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["past",418,422],["past",843,847],["there",868,873]],"spa_preps":[["about",279,284],["through",572,579]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0408163265,"vader_sentiment":0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961812496},{"para_id":2,"paragraph":"July 8th, Sunday","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["July 8th,",0,9],["Sunday",10,16]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961691499},{"para_id":3,"paragraph":"At the consulate, yesterday, a queer, stupid, good-natured, fat-faced individual came in, dressed in a sky blue, coarse, cut-away coat, and mixed pantaloons, which( both coat and trousers) seemed rather too small for his goodly size. He turned out to be the Yankee who came to England, a few weeks ago, to see the Queen, on the strength[ 18] of having sent her his own and his wife's daguerreotype, and having received a note of thanks from her secretary. Having been swindled by a fellow-passenger, he has loafed about here ever since his arrival, unable to get home - and, indeed, unwilling, until he shall have gone to London to see the Queen; and, to support himself, he has parted with all the clothes he brought with him, and thrusts himself into the narrow limits of this sky-blue coat and mixed pantaloons. It is certainly a very odd-looking court-dress; and he hinted, with a melancholy, stupid smile, that he did not look quite fit to see the Queen now. Of course, he wanted my assistance; but it is marvellous, the pertinacity with which he clings to his idea of going to court, and, though starving, will not think of endeavoring to get home, till that has been effected. I laid his absurdity before him, in the plainest terms. \" My dear man!\" quoth he, with good-natured, simple stubbornness,\" if you could but enter into my feelings, and see the business from beginning to end, as I see it!\" And this he repeated over and over again. He wished me, if I would not help him myself, to give him the names of some American merchants, to whom he might apply for means to get to London; but I refused to interfere with his affairs in any way, unless he promised to go back immediately to the United States, in case I could get him a passage. Besides his desire[ 19] to see the Queen, he has likewise( like so many of his countrymen) a fantasy that he is one of the legal heirs of a great English inheritance. No doubt, this dream about the Queen and his English estate has haunted his poor, foolish mind for years and years; and he deems it the strangest and mournfullest perversity of fate, and awfullest cruelty in me, that now - when he has reached England, and has wealth and royal honors almost within his grasp - he must turn back, a poor, penniless, be-fooled simpleton, merely because I will not lend him thirty shillings to get to London. I had never such a perception of a complete booby before, in my life; it made me feel kindly towards him, and yet impatient that such a fool should exist. Finally( as he had not a penny in his pocket, and no means of getting anything to eat) I gave him a couple of shillings, and told him not to let me see him again, till he had made up his mind to get back to America - when I would beg a passage for him if I could. He thanked me, and went away, half crying, and yet with something like a dull, good-natured smile on his face; still fixed in his inveterate purpose of getting to London to see the Queen!","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["England",277,284],["London",622,628],["London",1587,1593],["England",2160,2167],["London",2348,2354],["America",2718,2725],["London",2938,2944]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["good",46,50],["goodly",221,227],["support",655,662],["smile",904,909],["marvellous",1010,1020],["good",1271,1275],["promised",1661,1669],["like",1809,1813],["great",1890,1895],["kindly",2442,2448],["like",2841,2845],["good",2854,2858],["smile",2867,2872]],"neg_words":[["queer",31,36],["stupid",38,44],["fat",60,63],["coarse",113,119],["unable",549,555],["unwilling",583,592],["limits",764,770],["odd",838,841],["melancholy",885,895],["stupid",897,903],["pertinacity",1026,1037],["absurdity",1195,1204],["stubbornness",1292,1304],["refused",1601,1608],["interfere",1612,1621],["doubt",1920,1925],["poor",1993,1997],["foolish",1999,2006],["strangest",2053,2062],["perversity",2080,2090],["cruelty",2114,2121],["poor",2248,2252],["fooled",2268,2274],["impatient",2470,2479],["fool",2492,2496],["beg",2741,2744],["dull",2848,2852]],"events":[],"dates":[["yesterday",18,27],["a few weeks ago",286,301],["18",338,340],["19",1770,1772],["years",2016,2021],["years",2026,2031]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",520,524],["home",563,567],["home",1149,1153]],"spa_preps":[["away",125,129],["out",244,247],["about",514,519],["into",748,752],["into",1330,1334],["over",1427,1431],["over",1436,1440],["about",1938,1943],["within",2208,2214],["away",2799,2803]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0542635659,"vader_sentiment":-0.92,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9984922409},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"July 13th( Friday) Newby Bridge","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Newby Bridge",19,31]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["July 13th",0,9],["Friday",11,17]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9940978289},{"para_id":5,"paragraph":"I left Liverpool at \u00bd past 1 on Saturday last, by the London and Northwestern railway, for Leamington, arrived between 8&amp; 9, P.M.; spent Sunday there, and started at[ 20] about 12 \u00bd on Monday, for the English lakes, taking the whole family.

They load our supper and breakfast tables with trout, cold beef, ham, toast muffins, et cetera; and give us three fine courses for dinner, and excellent wine - the cost of which remains to be seen. This is not one of the celebrated stations among the lakes; but twice a day a stage coach passes from Milnthorpe towards Ulverston, and twice returns; and three times a little steamer passes to-and-fro between our hotel and the head of the lake.

This lake is a lovely little pool among the hills, long and narrow, beautifully indented with tiny bays and headlands; and when we saw it, it was one smile( as broad a smile as its narrowness allowed) with really brilliant sunshine. All the scenery we have yet met with is in excellent taste, and keeps itself within very proper bounds - never getting too wild and ragged to shock the sensibilities of cultivated people, as American scenery is apt to do. On the rudest surfaces of English earth, there is seen the effect of centuries of civilization; so that you do not quite get at naked Nature anywhere.

There is a railway-station close by the ruins; and a new hotel stands within the precincts of the Abbey Grounds; and continually there is the shriek, the whiz, the rumble, the bell-ringing, denoting the arrival of the trains, and passengers alight and step at once( as their choice may be) into the refreshment-room to get a glass of ale or cigar, or upon the gravelled paths of the lawn, leading to the old broken walls and arches of the Abbey. The ruins are extensive, and the closure of the Abbey is stated to have covered a space of sixty - five acres. It is impossible to describe them. The most interesting part is that which was formerly the church, and which, though now roofless, is still surrounded by walls, and has the remnants of the pillars that formerly supported the intermingling curves of the arches. The floor is all overgrown with grass, strewn with fragments and capitals of pillars. It was a great and stately edifice, the length and the nave and choir having been nearly three hundred feet,[ 25] and that of the transept more than half as much. The pillars along the nave were alternately a round, solid one, and a clustered one; now, what remains of some of them is even with the ground; others present a stump just high enough to form a seat, and others are perhaps a man's height from the ground - and all are mossy and with grass and weeds rooted in their chinks, and here and there a tuft of flowers is giving its tender little beauty to their decay. The material of the edifice is a soft, red stone; and it is now extensively overgrown with a lichen, of a very light gray hue, which at a little distance makes the walls look as if they had long ago been white-washed, and now had partially returned to their original color. I never saw anything like the immense, the noble arches of the nave and transept; there were four of them together, supporting a tower which has long since disappeared - arches loftier than I ever conceived to have been made by man. Very possibly, in some cathedral that I have see, or am yet to see, there may be arches as stately as these; but I doubt whether they can ever show to such advantage in a perfect edifice as they do in this ruin - most of them broken - only one, as far as I recollect, still completing its sweep. In this state, they[ 26] suggest a greater majesty and beauty than any human work can show - the crumbling traces of the half obliterated design producing somewhat of the effect of the first idea of anything admirable, when it dawns upon the mind of an artist or a poet - an idea which, do what he may, he is sure to fall short of.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Furness Abbey",11,24],["Abbey",133,138],["Abbey",474,479],["Abbey",529,534]],"geonouns":[["railway",46,53],["station",54,61],["hotel",92,97],["trains",253,259],["paths",405,410],["lawn",418,422],["walls",450,455],["church",684,690],["walls",747,752],["ground",1239,1245],["seat",1297,1301],["ground",1350,1356],["stone",1557,1562],["walls",1678,1683],["tower",1917,1922]],"pos_words":[["leading",424,431],["interesting",636,647],["supported",804,813],["great",949,954],["stately",959,966],["solid",1156,1161],["enough",1280,1286],["tender",1477,1483],["beauty",1491,1497],["soft",1547,1551],["like",1809,1813],["immense",1818,1825],["noble",1831,1836],["supporting",1904,1914],["stately",2112,2119],["advantage",2177,2186],["perfect",2192,2199],["majesty",2360,2367],["beauty",2372,2378],["work",2394,2398],["admirable",2525,2534]],"neg_words":[["ruins",75,80],["shriek",177,183],["broken",443,449],["ruins",485,490],["impossible",598,608],["stump",1264,1269],["decay",1507,1512],["doubt",2136,2141],["ruin",2227,2231],["broken",2247,2253],["crumbling",2414,2423],["obliterated",2443,2454],["fall",2634,2638]],"events":[],"dates":[["12",31,33],["the transept more than half",1066,1093],["26",2338,2340]],"times":[],"distances":[["nearly three hundred feet",1022,1047]],"loc_advs":[["there",164,169],["here",1430,1434],["there",1439,1444],["there",1870,1875],["there",2089,2094]],"spa_preps":[["about",25,30],["close",62,67],["within",105,111],["into",325,329],["along",1115,1120],["round",1149,1154],["together",1894,1902]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0352422907,"vader_sentiment":0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.9960759282},{"para_id":10,"paragraph":"In the middle of the choir is a much dilapidated monument of a cross-legged knight( a crusader, of course) in armor, very rudely executed; and up against the wall lie two or three more bruised and battered warriors, with square helmets on their heads, and visors down. Nothing can be uglier than these figures; the sculpture of those days seems to have been far behind the architecture. And yet they knew how to put a grotesque expression into the faces of their images, and we saw some fantastic shapes and heads at the lower points of arches, which would do to copy into Punch. In the chancel, just at the point below where the high altar stood, was the burial-place of the old barons of Kendal. The broken crusader perhaps represents one of them; and some of their stalwart bones might be found, by digging down. Against the wall of the choir, near the vacant space where the altar was, are some stone seats with canopies richly carved in stone, all quite perfectly preserved; these were where the priest used to sit[ 27] at intervals, during the celebration of mass. Conceive all these shattered walls, with here and there an arched door, or the great arched vacancy of a window - these broken stones and monuments scattered about - these rows of pillars up and down the nave - these arches, through which a giant might have stept, and not needed to bow his head, unless in reverence to the sanctity of the place - conceive it all with such verdure, and embroidery of flowers, as the gentle, kindly moisture of the English climate procreates on all good things, making them more beautiful old than new - conceive it with the grass for sole pavement of the long and spacious aisle, and the sky above for the only roof. The sky, to be sure, is more majestic than the tallest of those arches; and yet these latter perhaps make the stronger impression of sublimity, because they translate the sweep of the sky to our finite comprehensions.

I never before had given myself the trouble to form any distinct idea of what an abbey or monastery was - a place where holy rites were daily and continually to be performed, with places to eat and sleep contiguous and convenient, in order that the monks might always be at hand to perform those rites. They lived only to worship, and therefore lived under the same contiguity of roof with their place of worship, which, of course, was the principle object in the edifice, and hallowed the whole of it.

Old men look very antiqua32ted here, in their old fashioned coats and breeches, sunning themselves by the wayside. We reached home somewhere about eight o sup &gt; clock - home I see I have called it; and it seems as homelike a spot as any we have found in England, the old inn, close by the bridge, beside the clear river, pleasantly overshadowed by trees. It is entirely English, and like nothing that one sees in America; and yet I feel as if I might have lived here a long while ago, and had now come back because I retained pleasant recollections of it. The children, too, make themselves at home. Julian spends his time from morning till night, fishing for minnows or trout, and catching nothing at all; and Una and Rosebud have been riding between field and barn, in a hay-cart. The roads give us beautiful walks along the river-side, or wind away among the gentle hills; and if we had nothing else to look at in these walks, the hedges and stone fences would afford interest enough - so many and pretty are the flowers, roses, honey-suckle, and other sweet things, and so abundantly does the moss and ivy grow among the old stones of the fences, which would never have a single shoot of vegetation on them, in America, till the very end of time. But here, no sooner is a stone fence built, than Nature sets to work to make it a part of herself; she adopts it, and adorns it as if it were her own child. A little sprig of ivy may be seen creeping up the side, and clinging fast with its many feet;[ 33] a tuft of grass roots itself between two of the stones, where a little dust from the road has been moistened into soil for it; a small bunch of fern grows in another such crevice; a deep, soft, green moss spreads itself over the top and all along the sides of the fence; and wherever nothing else will grow, lichens adhere to the stones and variegate their hues. Finally, a great deal of shrubbery is sure to cluster along its extent, and take away hall hardness from the outline; and so the whole stone-fence looks as if God had had at least as much to do with it as man. The trunks of the trees, too, exhibit a similar parasitical vegetation. Parasitical is an unkind phrase to bestow on this beautiful love and kindred which seems to exist here, between one plant and thing another[ sic]; the strong thing being always ready to give support and sustenance, and the weak thing to repay with beauty, so that both are the richer; - as in the case of ivy and woodbine clustering up the trunk of a tall tree, and adding Corinthian grace to its lofty strength.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Ulverston",103,112],["England",731,738],["America",890,897],["America",1692,1699]],"geonouns":[["town",220,224],["market",299,305],["streets",354,361],["doors",467,472],["inn",748,751],["bridge",766,772],["river",791,796],["trees",825,830],["field",1229,1234],["roads",1264,1269],["river",1304,1309],["hills",1346,1351],["stone",1422,1427],["stones",1606,1612],["stone",1753,1758],["feet",1973,1977],["stones",2032,2038],["road",2069,2073],["stones",2314,2320],["hall",2433,2437],["stone",2482,2487],["trees",2575,2580],["tree",2985,2989]],"pos_words":[["agreeable",14,23],["hot",85,88],["pleasantly",798,808],["like",860,864],["pleasant",1003,1011],["beautiful",1278,1287],["gentle",1339,1345],["afford",1441,1447],["enough",1457,1463],["pretty",1478,1484],["sweet",1533,1538],["work",1792,1796],["fast",1954,1958],["soft",2172,2176],["top",2213,2216],["great",2358,2363],["beautiful",2679,2688],["love",2689,2693],["strong",2780,2786],["ready",2806,2811],["support",2820,2827],["beauty",2877,2883],["richer",2906,2912],["grace",3013,3018]],"neg_words":[["uncomfortably",61,74],["creeping",1919,1927],["dust",2055,2059],["unkind",2647,2653],["weak",2852,2856]],"events":[],"dates":[["weekly",292,298],["the day",405,412],["the clear",781,790]],"times":[["the morning",228,239],["morning",1105,1112],["night",1118,1123]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["home",29,33],["here",505,509],["home",600,604],["somewhere",605,614],["home",646,650],["here",939,943],["home",1071,1075],["here",1732,1736],["away",2428,2432],["here",2727,2731]],"spa_preps":[["through",200,207],["out",460,463],["about",615,620],["close",753,758],["beside",774,780],["between",1221,1228],["along",1294,1299],["away",1324,1328],["among",1329,1334],["among",1592,1597],["between",2013,2020],["into",2093,2097],["over",2204,2208],["along",2225,2230],["along",2401,2406],["between",2733,2740]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0678571429,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986658096},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"Mr. White( our landlord) has lent us a splendid work with engravings, illustrating the antiquities of Furness Abbey.

It was a very lonely road, though as smooth, hard, and well-kept, as any thoroughfare in the suburbs of a city; hardly a dwelling on either side, except one, half - barn, half farm-house; and one gentleman's gateway near the beginning of the road, and another more than a mile higher up. At two or three points, there were stone-barns, which are here built with great solidity. At one place, there was a painted board, announcing that a field of five acres was to be sold, and referring those desirous of purchasing to a solicitor in London. The lake-country is but a London Suburb. Nevertheless, this walk was lonely and lovely; the copse, and the broad-hillside, the glimpses of the lake, the great, misty company of pikes and fells, beguiled me into a sense of something like solitude; and the bleating of the sheep, remote and near, had a like tendency. Gaining the summit of the hill, I had the best view of lake Windermere which I have yet obtained; - the best, I should think, that can be had, though, being towards the south, it brings the softer instead of the more striking features of the landscape into view. But it shows nearly the whole extent of the lake, all the way from Lowwood to just above Newby Bridge; and I think that there can hardly be anything more beautiful in the world. The water was like a strip and gleam of sky, fitly set among lovely slopes of[ 39] earth. It was no broader than many a river; and yet you saw at once that it could be no river, its outline being so different from that of a running stream, not straight, nor winding, but stretching to one side or the other, as the shores made room for it; - a thing that could make its own way through the world, but must take what was allowed it.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Windermere",169,179],["Windermere",476,486],["London",1034,1040],["London",1068,1074],["Windermere",1418,1428],["Lowwood",1688,1695],["Newby Bridge",1710,1722]],"geonouns":[["road",69,73],["hill",92,96],["hotel",109,114],["road",149,153],["town",161,165],["winding",273,280],["town",319,323],["road",341,345],["valley",372,378],["ridges",396,402],["lake",437,441],["town",468,472],["road",521,525],["farm",676,680],["house",681,686],["road",742,746],["points",804,810],["stone",823,828],["field",937,942],["lake",1046,1050],["country",1051,1058],["lake",1185,1189],["pikes",1219,1224],["summit",1370,1376],["hill",1384,1388],["lake",1413,1417],["landscape",1600,1609],["lake",1665,1669],["water",1803,1808],["slopes",1867,1873],["river",1919,1924],["river",1970,1975],["stream",2031,2037],["winding",2057,2064],["shores",2114,2120]],"pos_words":[["led",259,262],["leading",404,411],["smooth",537,543],["well",555,559],["great",862,867],["desirous",993,1001],["lovely",1122,1128],["great",1195,1200],["like",1274,1278],["like",1343,1347],["best",1400,1404],["best",1462,1466],["softer",1548,1554],["striking",1575,1583],["beautiful",1775,1784],["like",1813,1817],["lovely",1860,1866]],"neg_words":[["lonely",514,520],["hard",545,549],["lonely",1111,1117]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the evening",3,14]],"distances":[["mile",221,225],["more than a mile",760,776]],"loc_advs":[["away",418,422],["near",716,720],["there",812,817],["here",846,850],["there",892,897],["there",1741,1746]],"spa_preps":[["along",266,271],["into",353,357],["between",379,386],["within",443,449],["into",1248,1252],["near",1331,1335],["into",1610,1614],["above",1704,1709],["among",1854,1859],["through",2177,2184]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0707070707,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9980555773},{"para_id":24,"paragraph":"This morning, it is rainy; and we are not very comfortable or contented, being all confined to our little parlor, which has a broken window, against which I have pinned the\" Times,\" to keep out the damp, chill air.

The town is a confused and irregular little place, of very uneven surface; there is an old church in it, and nothing else that I remember particularly, unless it be two or three large hotels. We staid there perhaps half an hour, and then went to the steamboat pier, where, shortly, a steamer arrived, with music sounding, on the deck of which, with her back to us, sat a lady in a gray travelling-cloak. Julian cried out\" Mamma, Mamma!\" - to which the lady deigned no notice; but he repeating it, she turned round, and was as much surprised, no doubt, at seeing her husband and son, as if this little lake had been the great ocean, and we encountering from opposite shores of it. We soon steamed back to Lowwood, and took a car thence for Rydal and Grasmere, after a cold luncheon.

It certainly did look very small; and I said, in my American scorn, that I could carry it away bodily in a porringer. It is nothing but a little, grassy-bordered pool, among the surrounding hills, which ascend directly from its margin; so that one might fancy it, not a permanent body of water, but a rather extensive accumulation of recent rain. Moreover, it was rippled with a breeze, as so, as I remember it( though the sun shone) looked dull and sulky, like a child out of humor. Now, the best thing these little ponds can do, is, to keep perfectly calm and smooth, and not attempt to show off any airs of their own, but to content themselves with serving[ 44] as a mirror for whatever of beautiful or picturesque there may be in the scenery around them.

We inquired whose it was; and the driver said it was\" Mr. W a rdsworth's!\" - and that Mrs. W a rdsworth was still residing there. So we were much delighted to have seen his abode; and as we were to stay the night at Grasmere, about two miles farther on, we determined to come back and inspect as particularly as should be allowable. Accordingly, after taking quarters at Brown's Hotel( a very good house, on a retired and picturesque site, with fine mountain-views about it) we got into out return-car, and reaching the head of Rydal water, alighted to walk through this familiar scene of so many years of Wordsworth's life. We ought to have seen DeQuincey's former residence and Hartley Coleridge's cottage, I believe, on our way, but we were not aware of it at the time. Near the lake there is a stone-quarry,[ 45] and a cavern of some extent, artificially formed, no doubt, by taking out the stone. Above the shore of the lake, not a great way from Wordsworth's residence, there is a flight of steps hewn in a rock, and ascending to a rocky seat whence a good view of Rydal water, such as it is, may be attained; and as Wordsworth has probably sat there hundreds of times, so did we ascend and sit down, and look at the hills, and at the flags on the lake's shore.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",88,97],["Grasmere",517,525],["Rydal",829,834],["Wordsworth",907,917],["Wordsworth",1253,1263],["Rydal",1372,1377],["Wordsworth",1424,1434]],"geonouns":[["foot",33,37],["lake",45,49],["house",132,137],["house",241,246],["house",699,704],["mountain",751,759],["head",821,825],["water",835,840],["residence",967,976],["cottage",1001,1008],["lake",1083,1087],["stone",1099,1104],["quarry",1105,1111],["stone",1196,1201],["shore",1213,1218],["lake",1226,1230],["residence",1266,1275],["rock",1314,1318],["seat",1345,1349],["water",1378,1383],["hills",1524,1529],["lake",1555,1559],["shore",1562,1567]],"pos_words":[["modern",142,148],["pretty",218,224],["comfortable",229,240],["commendable",282,293],["delighted",447,456],["good",694,698],["picturesque",723,734],["fine",746,750],["great",1238,1243],["good",1359,1363]],"neg_words":[["doubt",1171,1176],["rocky",1339,1344]],"events":[],"dates":[["so many years",890,903],["45",1114,1116]],"times":[["the night",504,513]],"distances":[["about two miles",527,542]],"loc_advs":[["there",424,429],["there",1088,1093],["there",1277,1282],["there",1452,1457]],"spa_preps":[["about",766,771],["into",783,787],["out",788,791],["through",859,866],["out",1188,1191],["down",1502,1506]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0547945205,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986640215},{"para_id":33,"paragraph":"Reaching the house that had been pointed out to us as Wordsworth's residence, we began to peer about, at its front and gables, and over the garden-wall, on both sides of the road - quickening up our enthusiasm as much as we could, and meditating to pilfer some flower or ivy-leaf from the house or its vicinity, to be kept as sacred memorials. At this juncture, a man approached who announced himself as the gardener of the place, and said he could show us Wordsworth's garden; - and said, too, that this was not Wordsworth's house at all, but the residence of Mr. Ball, a Quaker gentleman; - but that his grounds adjoined Wordsworth's, and that he had liberty to take visitors through the latter. How queer, if we should have carried away ivy-leaves and tender recollections from this domicile of a respectable quaker. The gardener was an intelligent young man, of pleasant, sociable and respectful[ 46] address; and as we went along, he talked about Wordsworth, whom he had known, and who, he said, was very familiar with the country-people. He lead us through his master's grounds, up a steep hillside, by winding, gravelled walks, with summer-houses at points favorable for that purpose. It was a very shady and pleasant spot, containing about an acre of ground, and all turned to much account by the manner of laying out; so that it seemed more than it really is. In one place( on a little, smooth slab of slate, let into a rock) there is an inscription by Wordsworth, which I think I have read in his works, claiming kindly regards from those who visit the spot, after his departure, because many trees had here been spared, at his intercession. Wordsworth's own grounds( or rather his ornamental garden) is separated from Mr. Ball's only by a wire fence, or some such barrier; and the gates have no fastening; so that the whole appears like one possession, and doubtless was so as regarded the poet's walks and enjoyments. We approached by such winding paths that I hardly know how the house stands in relation to the road; but, after much circuitry, we really did see Wordsworth's residence, an old house, with an uneven ridge-pole, built of stone, no doubt, but plaistered[ sic] over of some neutral tint; - a house that would not have been remarkably pretty in itself, but so delightfully situated, so secluded, so hedged about with shrubbery and adorned with flowers, so ivy-grown on one[ 47] side, so beautified with many years of the personal care of him who lived in it and loved it - that it seemed the very place for a poet's residence; and as if, while he lived so long in it, his poetry had manifested itself in flowers, shrubbery and ivy. I never smelt such a delightful fragrance of flowers as there was all through the garden. In front of the house, there is a circular terrace, of two ascents, in raising which Wordsworth had himself performed much of the labor; and here there are two seats, from which is obtained a fine view down the valley of the Rothay, and Windermere in the distance - a view of several miles, and which we did not think of seeing, after winding among the hills for far from the lake. It is very beautiful and picturelike. While we sat here, Mamma happened to refer to the ballad of little Barbara Lewthwaite; and the gardener said that little Barbara had died not a great while since, an elderly woman, leaving grown up children behind her. Her marriage name was Thompson; and the gardener believed that there was nothing remarkable in her character.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",54,64],["Wordsworth",457,467],["Wordsworth",513,523],["Wordsworth",623,633],["Wordsworth",952,962],["Wordsworth",1462,1472],["Wordsworth",1652,1662],["Wordsworth",2076,2086],["Wordsworth",2833,2843],["Rothay",2973,2979],["Windermere",2985,2995]],"geonouns":[["house",13,18],["residence",67,76],["wall",147,151],["road",174,178],["house",289,294],["house",526,531],["residence",548,557],["grounds",606,613],["country",1028,1035],["grounds",1076,1083],["winding",1109,1116],["houses",1147,1153],["points",1157,1163],["ground",1259,1265],["rock",1429,1433],["trees",1603,1608],["grounds",1669,1676],["gates",1792,1797],["winding",1952,1959],["paths",1960,1965],["house",1993,1998],["road",2025,2029],["residence",2089,2098],["house",2107,2112],["ridge",2129,2134],["stone",2150,2155],["house",2219,2224],["residence",2542,2551],["house",2764,2769],["terrace",2791,2798],["seats",2908,2913],["valley",2959,2965],["winding",3083,3090],["hills",3101,3106],["lake",3124,3128]],"pos_words":[["enthusiasm",199,209],["liberty",653,660],["tender",755,761],["respectable",800,811],["intelligent",840,851],["pleasant",866,874],["sociable",876,884],["respectful",889,899],["lead",1047,1051],["master",1067,1073],["favorable",1164,1173],["pleasant",1216,1224],["smooth",1396,1402],["works",1507,1512],["kindly",1523,1529],["like",1843,1847],["doubtless",1868,1877],["remarkably",2250,2260],["pretty",2261,2267],["delightfully",2286,2298],["loved",2488,2493],["delightful",2679,2689],["beautiful",3141,3150],["great",3312,3317],["remarkable",3468,3478]],"neg_words":[["queer",702,707],["steep",1090,1095],["shady",1206,1211],["uneven",2122,2128],["doubt",2160,2165],["smelt",2666,2671],["died",3301,3305]],"events":[],"dates":[["quaker",812,818],["summer",1140,1146],["47",2400,2402],["many years",2429,2439],["a fine",2938,2944]],"times":[],"distances":[["several miles",3024,3037]],"loc_advs":[["away",735,739],["there",1435,1440],["here",1613,1617],["there",2714,2719],["there",2771,2776],["here",2889,2893],["there",2894,2899],["here",3181,3185],["behind",3375,3381],["there",3450,3455]],"spa_preps":[["out",41,44],["about",95,100],["over",131,135],["through",678,685],["along",929,934],["about",946,951],["through",1055,1062],["about",1242,1247],["out",1322,1325],["into",1422,1426],["over",2188,2192],["about",2332,2337],["through",2728,2735],["down",2950,2954],["among",3091,3096]],"normalised_sentiment":0.06271777,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9923801422},{"para_id":34,"paragraph":"There is a summer house at one extremity of Wordsworth's ground, in deepest shadow, but with glimpses of mountain views through trees which shut it in, and which have spread intercepting boughs since Wordsworth died.

Nevertheless, rain is rain, and wets a man just as much among the mountains as anywhere else; so we have been kept within doors all day, till an hour or so ago, when Julian and I went down to the village in quest of the post-office.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["hills",116,121],["points",147,153],["fall",181,185],["forces",213,219],["hill",303,307],["country",308,315],["mountains",736,745],["doors",792,797],["village",866,873],["post",890,894]],"pos_words":[["better",486,492],["fair",602,606]],"neg_words":[["cloudy",31,37],["mists",82,87],["hang",88,92],["swollen",243,250],["gloomy",291,297],["breaks",356,362],["gloom",407,412],["lie",546,549],["cloudy",617,623],["superficial",646,657]],"events":[],"dates":[["5",0,1],["All day",11,18],["day",277,280],["to-day",435,441],["day",607,610],["all day",798,805]],"times":[["an hour or so ago",812,829]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",236,240],["there",336,341],["anywhere",749,757]],"spa_preps":[["through",395,402],["among",726,731],["within",785,791],["down",854,858]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.1052631579,"vader_sentiment":-0.02,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973866343},{"para_id":37,"paragraph":"We took a path that leads from the hotel across the fields, and coming into a road, crosses the Rothay by a one arched bridge, and passes the village church. The Rothay is very swift and turbulent to-day, and hurries along with foam-specks on its surface, filling its banks from brim to brim, a stream of perhaps twenty feet across. Perhaps more; for I am willing that the good little river should have all it can fairly claim; it is the Saint Lawrence of several of these English lakes, through which it flows, and carries off their superfluous waters. In its haste, and with its rushing sound, it was pleasant both to see and hear; and it sweeps by one side of the old churchyard where Wordsworth lies buried - the side where his grave is made. The church of Grasmere is a very plain structure, with a low body, on one side of which is a low porch with a pointed arch; the tower is[ 50] square, and look ancient; but the whole is overlaid with plaister[ sic] of a buff or pale yellow hue. It was originally built, I suppose, of rough, shingly stones, as many of the houses hereabouts are now; and, like many of them, the plaister[ sic] is used to give a sort of finish. We found the gate of the church-yard wide open; and the grass was lying on the graves, having probably been mowed yesterday. It is but a small churchyard, and with few monuments of any pretension in it, most of them being slate headstones standing erect. From the gate at which we entered, a distinct foot track leads to the corner nearest the river-side; and I turned into it by a sort of instinct, the more readily as I saw a tourist-looking man approaching from that point, and a woman looking among the grave stones.

Hartley Coleridge lies a little behind, in the direction of the church, his feet being towards Wordsworth's head, who lies in the row of those of his own blood. I found Hartley Coleridge's grave sooner than[ 51] Wordsworth's; for it is of marble, and, though simple enough, has more of a sculptured device about it - having been erected, as I think the inscription states, by his brother and sister. Wordsworth has only the very simplest slab of slate with\" William Wordsworth,\" and nothing else upon it. As I recollect, it is the midmost grave of the row. It is, or has been, well grass-grown; but the grass s quite worn away from the top, though sufficiently luxuriant at the sides; it looks as if people had stood upon it, and so does the grave next to it, which I believe is one of his children. I plucked some grass and weeds from it; and as he was buried within so few years, they may fairly be thought to have drawn their nutriment from Wordsworth's mortal remains - and I gathered them from just above his head. There is no fault to be found with his grave - within view of the hills, within sound of the river murmuring near by - no fault, except that he is packed so closely with his kindred; and, moreover, that, being so old a churchyard, the earth over him must all have been human once. He might have had fresh earth to himself; but he chose this grave deliberately. No very stately and broad-based monument can ever be erected over it, without infringing upon, covering, and overshadowing, the graves not only of his family, but of individuals who probably were quite disconnected with him.

I call it a village; but it is no village at all, all the dwellings standing apart, each in its own little domain, and each, I believe, with its own little lane leading to it, independently of the rest. Most of these are old cottages, plaistered[ sic] white, with antique porches, and roses and other shrubbery trained against them, or growing about them; some, too, are ivy-grown. There are a few edifices of more pretension, and of modern build, but not so strikingly as to put the rest out of countenance. The post-office, when I found it, proved to be an ivied cottage, with a good deal of shrubbery around it, having its own pathway, like the other cottages.

We were surprised at the extremely antique appearance of the church. It is paved with bluish gray flag-stones, over which uncounted generations have trodden, leaving the floor as well laid as ever. The walls are very thick; and the arched windows open through them at a considerable distance above the floor. There is no middle aisle; but first a row of pews next either wall, and then an aisle on each side of the pews occupying the centre of the church - thus, two side aisles, but no middle one. And right down through the centre of the church runs a row of five arches, the rudest and the roundest-headed that I ever saw, all of rough stone, supported by rough and massive pillars, or rather, square stone blocks, which stand in the pews, and stood in the same place, probably, long before the wood of those pews began to grow. Above this row or arches is another row, built upon the same mass of stone, and almost as broad, but lower; and on this upper row rests the frame-work, the oaken[ 54] beams, the black skeleton of the church-roof. It seems a very clumsy contrivance for supporting the roof; and if it were modern, we should certainly condemn it as very ugly; but being a relic of a simpler age, it comes in well with the antique simplicity of the whole structure. The roof goes up, barn-like, into its natural angle, and all the rafters and cross-beams are visible. There is an old font; and in the chancel is a niche, where( judging from a similar one in Furness Abbey) the holy water used to be places for the priest's use, while celebrating mass. Around the inside of the porch is a stone-bench, placed against the wall, narrow and uneasy, but where a great many people have sat, who now have found quieter resting-places.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",62,72],["Furness Abbey",1748,1761]],"geonouns":[["door",98,102],["church",110,116],["church",339,345],["stones",381,387],["walls",480,485],["wall",649,653],["church",726,732],["church",818,824],["stone",917,922],["stone",982,987],["wood",1076,1080],["stone",1179,1184],["church",1310,1316],["water",1772,1777],["stone",1878,1883],["wall",1910,1914]],"pos_words":[["sweeping",165,173],["well",457,461],["right",781,786],["supported",924,933],["work",1256,1260],["supporting",1362,1372],["modern",1398,1404],["simpler",1474,1481],["well",1499,1503],["like",1579,1583],["holy",1767,1771],["great",1947,1952],["quieter",1994,2001]],"neg_words":[["cloud",242,247],["dust",251,255],["rough",911,916],["rough",937,942],["clumsy",1339,1345],["condemn",1426,1433],["ugly",1445,1449],["uneasy",1927,1933]],"events":[],"dates":[["first a row",617,628],["54",1273,1275]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",18,23]],"spa_preps":[["out",224,227],["over",389,393],["through",530,537],["above",570,575],["down",787,791],["through",792,799],["into",1585,1589],["inside",1853,1859],["against",1898,1905]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0274725275,"vader_sentiment":0.4,"roberta_sentiment":0.9949151278},{"para_id":41,"paragraph":"The woman was a very intelligent looking person, not of the usual English ruddiness; but rather thin, and somewhat pale, though bright of aspect.

One went away almost immediately; but the other remained, and entering into a conversation with him, he told me that he was going to New Zealand, and expected to sail in September.

These people had gone to Quebec. He was a very civil, well-behaved, kindly sort of person, of a simple character, which I took to belong to the class and locality, rather than to himself individually. I could not very easily understand all that he said, owing to hs provincial dialect; and when he spoke to his own countrymen, or to the women of the house, I really could but just catch a word here and there. How long it takes to melt England down into a homogeneous mass!

Sophia( who is bolder than I, in these matters) ventured through what seemed a back-garden gate; and I soon heard her in conversation with some man, who now presented himself, and proved to be a gardener. He said that he had formerly acted in that capacity for Southey, although a gardener had not been kept by him as a regular part of his establishment. This was an old man with an odd crookedness of legs, and strange, disjointed limp. Sophia told him that we were Americans; and he[ 66] took the idea that we had come this long distance over sea and land, with the sole purpose of seeing Southey's residence; so that he was inclined to do what he could towards exhibiting it. This was but little; the present occupant( a Mr. Radday, I believe the gardener called him) being away, and the house shut up.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Greta Hall",367,377]],"geonouns":[["lane",28,32],["house",61,66],["house",250,255],["gate",613,617],["sea",1067,1070],["land",1075,1079],["residence",1123,1132],["house",1313,1318]],"pos_words":[["led",38,41],["great",299,304],["spacious",389,397]],"neg_words":[["discredit",341,350],["neglect",513,520],["odd",905,908],["strange",934,941],["limp",954,958]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",111,118],["there",458,463]],"spa_preps":[["into",92,96],["through",579,586],["over",1062,1066],["away",1299,1303]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0175438596,"vader_sentiment":-0.6,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961419702},{"para_id":55,"paragraph":"But he showed us about the grounds, and let us peep into the windows of what had been Southey's library, and those of another of the front apartments, and showed us the window of the chamber( in the rear of the house) where Southey died.

He might, indeed, get there out of his study in a moment. There are two paths, one above the other, well laid out on the steep declivity of the high bank; and there is such a very thick shade of oaks and elms( planted by Southey himself) over the bank, that all the ground and grass were moist, although it has been a sunny day. It is a very sombre walk; not many glimpses of the sky through those dense boughs. The Greta is here perhaps twenty yards across, and very dark of hue; and it[ s] voice is melancholy, and very suggestive of musings and reveries, but I should question whether it were favorable to any settled scheme of thought. The gardener told us that there used to be a pebbly beach on the margin of the river; and that it was Southey's habit to sit and write there, using a tree of peculiar[ 68] shape for a table. An alteration in the current of the river has swept away the beach, and the tree, too, has fallen. All these things were interesting to me, although Southey was not, I think, a picturesque man nor one whose personal character takes a strong hold of the imagination. In these walks, he used to wear a pair of shoes heavily clamped with iron; very ponderous they must have been, from the particularity with which the gardener mentioned them.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Greta",33,38],["Greta",93,98],["Greta",808,813]],"geonouns":[["house",4,9],["river",117,122],["house",242,247],["bank",289,293],["river",301,306],["paths",464,469],["bank",541,545],["bank",639,643],["ground",658,664],["beach",1084,1089],["river",1111,1116],["tree",1182,1186],["table",1216,1221],["river",1259,1264],["beach",1284,1289],["tree",1299,1303]],"pos_words":[["right",17,22],["audible",63,70],["swift",104,109],["led",262,265],["well",492,496],["favorable",988,997],["interesting",1344,1355],["picturesque",1400,1411],["strong",1457,1463]],"neg_words":[["steep",513,518],["dense",790,795],["dark",860,864],["melancholy",893,903],["peculiar",1190,1198],["fallen",1314,1320]],"events":[],"dates":[["a sunny day",708,719]],"times":[["hours and hours",366,381]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",23,28],["together",382,390],["there",414,419],["above",475,480],["there",551,556],["here",817,821],["there",1058,1063],["there",1167,1172]],"spa_preps":[["about",75,80],["along",279,284],["close",308,313],["out",420,423],["out",502,505],["over",630,634],["through",776,783],["across",843,849],["away",1275,1279]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0211267606,"vader_sentiment":0.84,"roberta_sentiment":0.9982947707},{"para_id":57,"paragraph":"The gardener dismissed us through the front entrance to the grounds; and returning to the King's Arms, we took a one horse fly for the falls of Lodore. Our ride thither was along the banks of Derwentwater; and it is as beautiful a road, I imagine, as can be found in England, or any where else. I like Derwentwater the best of all the lakes, so far as I have yet seen them. Skiddaw lies at the head of a long even ridge of mountain, rising into several peaks, and one the highest; on the eastern side, there are many noble eminences; and on the west( along which we rode) there is, a part of the way, a lovely wood, and, nearly the whole distance, a precipitous range of lofty cliff, descending sheer down, without any slope except what has been formed, in the lapse of ages, by the fall of fragments and the washing down of smaller stones. The declivity thus formed, along the base of the cliffs, is in some places covered with[ 69] trees or shrubs; elsewhere it is quite bare and barren. The precipitous part of the cliffs is very grand; the whole scene indeed might be characterized - without lauding it a great deal too much - as stern grandeur with an embroidery of rich beauty. All the sternness of it is softened by vegetative beauty, wherever it can possibly be thrown in; and there is not here, so strongly as along Windermere,[ evidence] that human art has been helping out Nature. I wish it were possible to give any idea of the shapes of the hills; with these, at least, man has had nothing to do, nor ever will. As we approached the bottom of this lake, and of the beautiful valley in which it lies, we saw one hill that seemed to crouch down, like a Titanic watch-dog, with its rear towards the spectator, guarding the entrance to the valley. The great superiority of these mountains over those of New England( besides the abundance everywhere of water-prospects, which are wanting among our own hills) is their variety and definiteness of shape. They rise up decidedly; and each is a hill by itself; while ours mingle into one another; and, besides, have such large bases that you can tell neither where they begin nor end. These Cumberland mountains have, many of them, at least, a marked vertebral shape, so that they can often look like a group of huge lions, lying down with their[ 70] rears turned towards each other. They slope down steeply from narrow ridges; hence these picturesque seclusions of valleys and dales, which subdivide the lake region into so many communities.

We found pleasant rooms here, and established ourselves for the night. From this point we have a view up the beautiful lake, and of Skiddaw at the head of it. The cascade, too, is within three or four minutes' walk, through the garden-gate, towards the cliff at the base of which the inn stands. The visitor would need no other guide than its own voice, which is said to be audible, sometimes, to the distance of four miles. As we were coming from Keswick, at some little distance from the inn, we caught glimpses of its white foam, high up on the precipice; and it is only glimpses that can be caught anywhere, because there is no regular sheet of falling water. Once, I think, it must have fallen right over the edge of the long line of precipice that here extends along, parallel with the[ 71] shore of the lake; but, in the course of time, it has gnawed and sawn its way into the heart of the cliff - this persistent little stream - so that now it has formed a rude gorge, adown which it hurries and tumbles, in the wildest way, over the roughest imaginable staircase. Standing at the bottom of the fall, you have a far vista, sloping upward to the sky, with the water - everywhere as white as snow - pouring and pouring down, now[ on] one side of the gorge, now on the other, among immense boulders which try to choke its passage. It does not attempt to leap over these huge rocks, but finds its way in and out among them, and finally gets to the bottom after a hundred tumbles. It cannot be better described than in Southey's verses, though worthy of better poetry than that. After all, I do not know that the cascade is anything more than the beautiful fringe to the grandeur of the scene; for it is very grand - this fissure through the cliff, with a steep, lofty precipice on the right hand, sheep up and down, and on the other hand, too, another lofty precipice, with a slope of its own ruin, on which trees and shrubbery have grown. The right hand precipice, however, has shelves affording sufficient hold for small trees; but nowhere does it slant. If it were not for the white little stream, tumbling softly downward, and for the[ 72] soft verdure up and down either precipice, and even along the very pathway of the cascade, it would be a very stern vista up that gorge.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Lodore",31,37],["Skiddaw",422,429],["Keswick",738,745]],"geonouns":[["inn",23,26],["country",59,66],["inn",67,70],["country",227,234],["inn",235,238],["point",371,376],["lake",409,413],["head",437,441],["gate",525,529],["inn",574,577],["inn",780,783],["precipice",838,847],["water",947,952],["edge",1004,1008],["line",1021,1025],["precipice",1029,1038],["shore",1087,1092],["lake",1100,1104],["stream",1218,1224],["water",1457,1462],["rocks",1670,1675],["precipice",2062,2071],["precipice",2152,2161],["slope",2170,2175],["trees",2202,2207],["precipice",2249,2258],["trees",2317,2322],["stream",2387,2393],["precipice",2470,2479]],"pos_words":[["good",11,15],["convenience",139,150],["fame",188,192],["pleasant",299,307],["beautiful",399,408],["audible",664,671],["right",989,994],["immense",1577,1584],["better",1787,1793],["worthy",1837,1843],["better",1847,1853],["beautiful",1940,1949],["grandeur",1964,1972],["grand",2002,2007],["right",2079,2084],["right",2238,2243],["sufficient",2291,2301],["soft",2438,2442]],"neg_words":[["primitive",48,57],["falling",939,946],["fallen",982,988],["rude",1255,1259],["tumbles",1294,1301],["choke",1607,1612],["tumbles",1765,1772],["steep",2049,2054],["ruin",2187,2191],["stern",2548,2553]],"events":[],"dates":[["71",1083,1085],["the fall",1389,1397]],"times":[["the night",350,359],["three or four minutes",477,498]],"distances":[["four miles",703,713]],"loc_advs":[["here",314,318],["anywhere",892,900],["there",910,915],["here",1044,1048],["upward",1429,1435],["everywhere",1465,1475],["nowhere",2328,2335]],"spa_preps":[["within",470,476],["through",506,513],["over",995,999],["along",1057,1062],["into",1165,1169],["over",1323,1327],["down",1515,1519],["among",1571,1576],["over",1654,1658],["out",1702,1705],["among",1706,1711],["through",2023,2030],["down",2104,2108],["down",2458,2462],["along",2490,2495]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0377358491,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987384677},{"para_id":59,"paragraph":"I shall not try to describe it any more; it has not been praised too much, though it may have been praised amiss.

But it seemed to me a good work of art; - a recumbent figure of white marble, on a couch, the drapery of which he has drawn about him - being quite enveloped in what may be a sheet or a shroud. The sculptor has not intended to represent death; for the figure lies sidelong, and has a book in its hand, and the face is lifelike, and looks full of expression - a thin, high-featured poetic face, with a finely proportioned head, and abundant hair. It represents Southey( and rightly, at whatever age he died) in the full maturity of manhood, when he was strongest and richest. I liked the statue, and wished that it lay in a broad aisle, or in the chancel, where there is an old tomb of a knight and lady of the Ratcliffe family, who have held the place of honor long enough to yield it now to a poet. Southey's sculptor was Lough.

Along the walls, on each side of the church, between the arched windows, there are marble-slabs, affixed, with inscriptions to the memories of those who used to occupy the seats beneath. I remember none of great antiquity, nor any old monument except that in the chancel, over the knight and lady of the Ratcliffe family. This consists of a slab of stone, on four small stone pillars about two feet high; the slab is inlaid with a brass-plate, on which is engraved the knight in armor, and the lady in the costume of Elizabeth's time, exceedingly well done and well preserved, and each figure as much a eighteen inches in length. The sexton produced a rubbing of them, on paper. Under the slab - which, supported by the low stone pillars, form a canopy for them - lie two sculptured figures of stone, of life-size and at full length,[ 75] representing this same knight and lady; but I think the sculptor was hardly equal in his art to the engraver.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Elizabeth",1388,1397]],"geonouns":[["church",129,135],["church",245,251],["stone",488,493],["walls",557,562],["walls",881,886],["church",908,914],["seats",1043,1048],["monument",1106,1114],["stone",1220,1225],["stone",1241,1246],["stone",1595,1600],["stone",1665,1670]],"pos_words":[["loving",93,99],["cheerful",104,112],["interesting",233,244],["free",483,487],["support",500,507],["modern",665,671],["finely",822,828],["great",1077,1082],["exceedingly",1406,1417],["well",1418,1422],["well",1432,1436],["supported",1574,1583]],"neg_words":[["lie",1635,1638]],"events":[],"dates":[["a few years",260,271],["centuries",373,382],["five hundred years old",765,787],["75",1706,1708]],"times":[],"distances":[["about two feet",1255,1269]],"loc_advs":[["there",201,206],["there",741,746],["there",944,949]],"spa_preps":[["amidst",721,727],["between",916,923],["beneath",1049,1056],["over",1143,1147]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0658682635,"vader_sentiment":0.87,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984496832},{"para_id":62,"paragraph":"The most curious antiquity in the church is the font.

After riding a few miles, we again came within sight of the enchanted ruin. It appears to stand rather more than midway adown the declivity of one of the ridges( to the left, as you go southwards) that form the valley; and its site would have been a good one for a fortress intended to defend the lower entrance of this mountain defile. At a proper distance, it looks not unlike the gray dilapidation of a Gothic castle, which has been crumbling and crumbling away for ages, until Time might be supposed to have imperceptibly stolen its massive pile away from men, and give it back to Nature; its towers, and battlements, and arched entrances being so much defaced and decayed, that all marks of human labor had nearly been obliterated; and the angles of the hewn stones rounded away; while mosses, and weeds, and bushes, grow over it as freely as over a natural ledge of rocks. It is conceivable that, in some lights, and in some states of the atmosphere, a traveller, at the entrance of the valley, might really imagine that he be78held a castle here; but, for myself, I must acknowledge that it required a willing fancy, to make me see it. As we drew nearer, the illusion did not immediately grow less strong; but at length we found ourselves passing at the foot of the declivity, with its mimic towers right above us; and, behold! it was nothing but an enormous ledge of rock, coning squarely out of the hillside, with other parts of the ledge cropping out in its vicinity. Looking back, after passing, we saw a knoll or hillock, of which the castled rock is the bare face. There are two or three stone cottages along the road-side, beneath the magic castle, and within the enchanted ground.

At an English hotel, the traveller feels as if everybody, from the landlord downward, were in a joint and individual purpose of fleecing him; because all the attendants, who come in contact with him, are to be separately considered. So, after paying, in the first instance, a very heavy bill for what would seem to cover the whole indebtedness, there remain divers dues still to be paid, to no trifling amount, to the landlord's servants - dues not to be ascertained, and which you never know whether you have properly satisfied. You can know, perhaps, when you have less than satisfied them, by the aspect of the waiter, which I wish I could describe; - not disrespectful, in the slightest degree, but a look of profound surprise, a gaze at the offered coin( which he nevertheless pockets) as if[ 89] he either did not see it, or did not know it, or could not believe his eyesight; - all this, however, with the most quiet forbearance, a Christian like non-recognition of an unmerited wrong and insult; - and, finally( all in a moment's space indeed) he quits you and goes about his other business. If you have given too much, too, you are made sensible of your folly by the extra amount of his gratitude, and the bows with which he salutes you from the door-step. But, generally, you cannot very decidedly say whether you have been right or wrong; but, in almost all cases, you decidedly feel that you have been fleeced. Then the living at the best of the English hotels( so far as my travels have brought me acquainted with them) deserves but moderate praise, and is especially lacking in variety. Nothing but joints, joints, joints; sometimes, perhaps, a meat pie, which, if you eat it, weighs upon your conscience with the idea that you have eaten the scraps and rejected relics of other people's dinners. At the lake-hotels, the fare( with the exception of trout, which are not always fresh, and which one soon tires of, at any rate) is mutton.

Close beside the Castle stands what looks like an old church.","file_id":"1870_a","plnames":[["Lancaster",51,60],["Lancaster Castle",431,447],["England",599,606],["Castle",676,682],["Castle",1012,1018]],"geonouns":[["town",43,47],["water",150,155],["town",482,486],["town",529,533],["stone",544,549],["houses",563,569],["streets",630,637],["town",705,709],["castle",736,742],["walls",796,801],["entrance",985,993],["church",1049,1055]],"pos_words":[["promised",351,359],["fine",377,381],["remarkable",511,521],["modern",608,614],["eminence",654,662],["satisfactory",748,760],["modern",823,829],["fine",857,861],["like",1037,1041]],"neg_words":[["delayed",322,329],["hasty",413,418]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the hour",245,253],["half an hour",330,342],["every minute",360,372]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",83,87],["without",99,106]],"spa_preps":[["down",228,232],["around",424,430],["down",646,650],["about",722,727],["over",957,961],["beside",1001,1007]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0729166667,"vader_sentiment":0.58,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9994978905},{"para_id":84,"paragraph":"The train left Lancaster at half past nine, and reached Liverpool( over as flat and uninteresting a country as I ever travelled) at twelve.
