Around the shores of the lake there are many places which may be made the temporary residence of the tourist while exploring the beauties of the adjacent country, and probably he may find it advantageous to make several of them his abode in succession: Bowness, on the east shore, half way between the two extremities, and therefore the most eligible; Ambleside, one mile beyond the head of the lake; Low Wood Inn, a mile and a half from its head on the east shore; the Ferry Inn on the promontory over against Bowness; and Newby Bridge at its foot,-- all furnish comfortable quarters for the tourist, where boats, guides, and all his other wants can be supplied.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Windermere",47,57],["Bowness",963,970],["Ambleside",1062,1071],["Low Wood Inn",1111,1123],["Ferry Inn",1180,1189],["Bowness",1221,1228],["Newby Bridge",1234,1246]],"geonouns":[["lakes",184,189],["head",254,258],["mountains",270,279],["hills",515,520],["cottages",570,578],["woods",598,603],["landscape",699,708],["shores",721,727],["lake",735,739],["residence",794,803],["country",864,871],["shore",984,989],["head",1093,1097],["lake",1105,1109],["head",1152,1156],["shore",1169,1174],["promontory",1197,1207],["boats",1318,1323]],"pos_words":[["soft",61,65],["graceful",70,78],["beauty",79,85],["admiration",206,216],["grandeur",233,241],["admirable",323,332],["gentle",409,415],["exuberantly",440,451],["richness",466,474],["beauty",634,640],["enrich",671,677],["advantageous",901,913],["comfortable",1274,1285]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["one mile",1073,1081],["a mile and a half",1125,1142]],"loc_advs":[["there",740,745]],"spa_preps":[["around",40,46],["amid",589,593],["between",1000,1007],["beyond",1082,1088],["over",1208,1212],["against",1213,1220]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1111111111,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987320304},{"para_id":44,"paragraph":"We shall commence our perambulation at the town first named, proceeding along the west border, and returning by the east border of the water.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["town",43,47],["water",135,140]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["along",72,77]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966770411},{"para_id":45,"paragraph":"Bowness.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Bowness",0,7]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9840923548},{"para_id":46,"paragraph":"[ Hotels:-- Crown.]","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9927095175},{"para_id":47,"paragraph":"This pretty village is placed on the edge of a large bay, opposite Bell Isle, about eight miles from Kendal, and six from Ambleside.

On the left is Bowfell, a square-topped hill, between which and the Pikes, Great End, and Great Gable peep up. On the left of Bowfell, the summit of Scawfell Pike is faintly visible. The road is intersected two miles from Bowness by the Kendal and Ambleside road, at a place called Cook's House, nine miles from Kendal. A road proceeds into Troutbeck Bridge is almost a mile. From this place a road conducts by the west bank of the stream to the village of Troutbeck, the nearest part of which is a mile and a half distant. Continuing our progress towards Ambleside, Calgarth, embossed in trees, is passed on the left. The late Bishop Watson built this mansion, and resided here during the latter years of his life; it is still occupied by his descendants. Two miles beyond is Low Wood Inn, which, standing pleasantly on the margin of the lake at its broadest part, is an excellent station for those who are able to devote a few days to the beauties of the neighbourhood. Most of the excursions recommended to be made from Ambleside may, with almost equal advantage, be performed from this inn. Close at hand is Dove's Nest, the house Mrs. Hemans inhabited one summer. Her description of the place, taken from her delightful letters, will not be deemed uninteresting:--\" The house was originally meant for a small villa, though it has long passed into the hands of farmers, and there is, in consequence, an air of neglect about the little demesne, which does not at all approach desolation, and yet it gives it something of touching interest. You see everywhere traces of love and care beginning to be effaced-- rose trees spreading into wildness-- laurels darkening the windows with too luxriant branches; and I cannot help saying to myself,' Perhaps some heart like my own in its feelings and sufferings has here sought refuge and repose.' The ground is laid out in rather an antiquated style; which, now that nature is beginning to reclaim it from art, I do not at all dislike. There is a little grassy terrace immediately under the window, descending to a small court, with a circular grass-plot, on which grows one tall, white-rose tree. You cannot image how much I delight in that fair, solitary, neglected-looking tree. I am writing to you from an old-fashioned alcove in the little garden, round which the sweet-briar and the rose-tree have completely run wild; and I look down from it upon a lovely Winandermere, which seems at this moment even like another sky, so truly is every summer cloud and tint of azure pictured in its transparent mirror.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Bowness",9,16],["Ambleside",21,30],["Westmorland",637,648],["Pikes",719,724],["Langdale",728,736],["Bowfell",775,782],["Pikes",828,833],["Great End",835,844],["Great Gable",850,861],["Bowfell",886,893],["Scawfell",909,917],["Pike",918,922],["Bowness",982,989],["Kendal",997,1003],["Ambleside",1008,1017],["Kendal",1072,1078],["Troutbeck Bridge",1101,1117],["Troutbeck",1217,1226],["Ambleside",1316,1325],["Calgarth",1327,1335],["Low Wood Inn",1537,1549],["Ambleside",1783,1792],["Dove's Nest",1872,1883],["Winandermere",3168,3180]],"geonouns":[["woods",44,49],["bay",125,128],["lake",136,140],["road",179,183],["waters",227,233],["edge",235,239],["wood",274,278],["road",284,288],["hill",305,309],["terrace",363,370],["mountains",614,623],["hill",800,804],["summit",899,905],["road",947,951],["road",1018,1022],["road",1082,1086],["road",1154,1158],["bank",1180,1184],["stream",1192,1198],["village",1206,1213],["trees",1349,1354],["mansion",1413,1420],["lake",1599,1603],["station",1642,1649],["inn",1850,1853],["house",1889,1894],["house",2035,2040],["trees",2377,2382],["ground",2606,2612],["terrace",2766,2773],["tree",2897,2901],["tree",2981,2985],["tree",3099,3103]],"pos_words":[["stately",36,43],["magnificent",373,384],["magnificent",588,599],["progress",1299,1307],["pleasantly",1567,1577],["excellent",1632,1641],["recommended",1755,1766],["advantage",1816,1825],["delightful",1974,1984],["love",2332,2336],["like",2523,2527],["reclaim",2695,2702],["delight",2931,2938],["fair",2947,2951],["sweet",3074,3079],["lovely",3161,3167],["like",3214,3218],["transparent",3297,3308]],"neg_words":[["steep",299,304],["neglect",2174,2181],["desolation",2239,2249],["antiquated",2638,2648],["dislike",2732,2739],["plot",2855,2859],["neglected",2963,2972],["wild",3124,3128],["cloud",3257,3262]],"events":[],"dates":[["the latter years",1446,1462],["a few days",1683,1693],["one summer",1917,1927],["every summer",3244,3256]],"times":[],"distances":[["a mile",93,99],["two miles",967,976],["nine miles",1056,1066],["almost a mile",1121,1134],["a mile and a half",1257,1274],["Two miles",1517,1526]],"loc_advs":[["left",213,217],["near",218,222],["there",437,442],["there",503,508],["left",767,771],["between",806,813],["left",878,882],["left",1373,1377],["here",1434,1438],["beyond",1527,1533],["there",2138,2143],["everywhere",2311,2321],["here",2570,2574]],"spa_preps":[["into",1096,1100],["into",2107,2111],["about",2182,2187],["into",2393,2397],["out",2621,2624],["under",2786,2791],["round",3058,3063],["down",3141,3145]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0289389068,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987275004},{"para_id":60,"paragraph":"\" I am so delighted with the spot, that I scarcely know how I shall leave it.

Passing Croft Lodge( J. Holmes, Esq.) on the right, Brathay Bridge is crossed at Clappersgate, one mile from Ambleside, and shortly afterwards Brathay Hall,( G. Redmayne, Esq.) is seen on the left. A bay, called Pull Wyke, there makes a deep indentation; and looking across the lake, Wansfell Holm, Low Wood Inn, and lower down, Calgarth, the seat of the late Bishop Watson, are pleasing objects. Wansfell Pike and the Troutbeck Hundreds tower above them. The road to Hawkshead having deviated to the right, the village of High Wray is gained, five miles from Ambleside; and three miles beyond is the Ferry Inn. At this place the shores suddenly contract, and between the two promontories a public ferry is established, by means of which, passengers, cattle, and vehicles are conveyed across the lake at a trifling charge. About the year 1635, a marriage was celebrated at Hawkshead, between a wealthy yeoman from the neighbourhood of Bowness, and a lady of the family Sawrey of Sawrey. As is still customary in Westmorland amongst the rustic population, the married couple were attended by a numerous concourse of friends, some of whom were probably more than cheerful. In conducting the bridegroom homewards, and crossing the ferry, the boat was swamped, either by an eddy of wind, or by too great a pressure on one side, and thus upwards of fifty people, including the bride and bridegroom, perished. While at the Ferry Inn, the tourist should not fail to visit the Station, a pleasure house belonging to Mr. Curwen of Belle Isle, standing on a spot whence fine views of the circumjacent scenery are commanded. \" The view from the Station,\" says Professor Wilson,\" is a very delightful one, but it requires a fine day. Its character is that of beauty, which disappears almost utterly in wet or drizzly weather. If there be a strong bright sunshine. a' blue breeze' perhaps gives animation to the scene. You look down on the islands whih are here very happily disposed. The banks of Windermere are rich and various in groves, woods, coppice, and corn-fields.

He therefore raised a small band of horse and set forth one Sunday morning in search of Briggs. Upon arriving at Kendal, he was informed that the Colonel was at prayers. Without further consideration he proceeded to the church, and having posted his men at the entrance, dashed forward himself down the principal aisle into the midst of the assemblage. Whatever were his intentions-- whether to shoot the Colonel on the spot, or merely to carry him off prisoner-- they were defeated; his enemy was not present. The congregation was at first too much surprised to seize the Major, who, in discovering that his object could not be effected, galloped up the next aisle. As he was making his exit from the church, his head came violently in contact with the arch of the door-way, which was much smaller than that through which he had entered. His helmet was struck off by the blow, his saddle girth gave way, and he himself was much stunned. The congregation, taking advantage of the confusion, attempted to seize him; but with the assistance of his followers, the Major made his escape after a violent struggle, and rode back to his brother's house.

The three bads of the lakes led the cheers that hailed Scott and Canning; and music, and sunshine, flags, streamers, and gay dresses, the merry hum of voices, and the rapid splashing of innumerable oars, made up a dazzling mixture of sensations as the flotilla wound its way among the richly-foliaged islands, and along bays and promontories peopled with enthusiastic spectators.\"","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Bolton",43,49],["Wordsworth",100,110],["Windermere",1197,1207],["Bolton",1417,1423]],"geonouns":[["seat",52,56],["woods",970,975],["lake",1023,1027],["point",1325,1330],["lakes",1462,1467],["islands",1741,1748],["bays",1760,1764],["promontories",1769,1781]],"pos_words":[["entertain",239,248],["illustrious",287,298],["proud",313,318],["loved",371,376],["brightest",476,485],["courtly",574,581],["plentiful",619,628],["fancy",702,707],["wise",726,730],["beautiful",818,827],["accomplished",832,844],["enjoy",864,869],["brilliant",937,946],["delicious",997,1006],["splendid",1159,1167],["radiant",1284,1291],["happy",1408,1413],["led",1468,1471],["merry",1578,1583],["rapid",1607,1612],["dazzling",1654,1662],["sensations",1674,1684],["richly",1725,1731],["enthusiastic",1795,1807]],"neg_words":[["difficult",412,421],["misunderstood",792,805],["hum",1584,1587],["wound",1701,1706]],"events":[],"dates":[["the last day",1046,1058]],"times":[["mornings",983,991]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["through",958,965],["over",1138,1142],["into",1350,1354],["among",1715,1720],["along",1754,1759]],"normalised_sentiment":0.1212121212,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9980154037},{"para_id":72,"paragraph":"Ambleside.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",0,9]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961099029},{"para_id":73,"paragraph":"[ Inns.-- Salutations; Commercial; White Lion.]","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9951751232},{"para_id":74,"paragraph":"Ambleside, a small and irregularly built market-town of 1592 inhabitants, is situate on steeply inclined ground, a mile from the head of Windermere, upon or near to the spot formerly occupied by the Roman Station-- Dictis.

Though more circuitous than the highway, it presents finer combinations of scenery. The tourist, intending to take this round, should pursue the road to Clappersgate for half a mile to Rothay Bridge, and having crossed the bridge, enter the first gate on the right. The road leads alongside the river, passing many handsome villas, to Pelter Bridge, 2 \u00bd miles. Rydal Hall, with its park, and Rydal Mount, will be frequently in sight. Behind, Ambleside, backed by Wansfell, has a picturesque appearance. On the right are the heights of Fairfield and Kirkstone. By crossing the bridge, the Keswick road will be gained, and the tourist can then either return to Ambleside, or proceed to Rydal, which is 300 or 400 yards further. Those who are fond of long walks ought to abstain from crossing the bridge, but, keeping to the left, pursue the road behind the farm house, called Coat How, which leads along the south-west shore of Rydal Mere. This mere being passed, the road ascends the hill side steeply for some time, until it reaches a splendid terrace, overlooking Grasmere Lake, with its single islet, and then, climbing again, joins on Red Bank the Grasmere, and Langdale road. Here the tourist has the choice of returning to Ambleside by Loughrigg Tarn and Clappersgate, or proceeding to Grasmere village, in doing which he will pass in succession Tail End, the Wyke, and the Cottage. The village is a sweet little place, at the head of the lake, 4 miles from Ambleside. In the churchyard are interred the remains of the poet Wordsworth. An excellent hotel( The Lowther and Hollins) has recently been opened on an eminence overlooking the high road from Ambleside to Keswick. Allan Bank, the residence of Thomas Dawson, Esq., stands on a platform of ground behind the village. The house was, for some time, the abode of Wordsworth. The house, however, in which he lived for many years, and in which he composed many of his most beautiful pieces, is at Grasmere Town End.

The cascade is not so remarkable in itself, as for the magnificent scenery around it. Langdale Pikes have a particularly striking appearance. By this bridge the traveller is conducted into Lancashire, in which county the road does not continue for more than a mile before it re-enters Westmorland at Colwith Bridge. A short distance above the bridge, the stream, issuing from a tarn further up, makes a fine cascade called Colwith Force. It is in a dell close to the road, and is about 70 feet high. A stupendous mountain, called Wetherlamb, occupies a conspicuous position in a chain of lofty hills on the south-west. Proceeding, Little Langdale Tarn becomes visible on the left-- on the right is Lingmoor, a hill which serves as a partition between the two Langdales. At the termination of the inclosed land, amongst a few trees, are two dwellings, called Fell Foot, seven and a-half miles from Ambleside. One of them was formerly an inn, whereat the gangs of pack-horses were refreshed previous to their ascent of the mountain passes of Wrynose and Hardknot-- this being the route by which the manufactures of Kendal were transported to the western coast. Taking the road to the right, and ascending some distance between the mountains, a solitary pool of water, named Blea Tarn, is perceived in the bottom of an elevated depression.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",55,64],["Langdales",90,99],["Great Langdale",160,174],["Dungeon Gill Force",203,221],["Pikes",241,246],["Skelwith",376,384],["Little Langdale",405,420],["Langdales",618,627],["Great Langdale",688,702],["Dungeon Gill Force",731,749],["Pikes",769,774],["Skelwith",904,912],["Little Langdale",933,948],["Blea Tarn",953,962],["Langdales",1145,1154],["Ambleside",1193,1202],["Clappersgate",1218,1230],["Brathay",1260,1267],["Loughrigg Fell",1345,1359],["Skelwith Bridge",1610,1625],["Ambleside",1644,1653],["Langdale Pikes",1827,1841],["Lancashire",1930,1940],["Westmorland",2026,2037],["Colwith Bridge",2041,2055],["Colwith Force",2164,2177],["Little Langdale Tarn",2372,2392],["Langdales",2500,2509],["Ambleside",2638,2647],["Wrynose",2781,2788],["Kendal",2854,2860],["Blea Tarn",3013,3022]],"geonouns":[["vale",152,156],["road",267,271],["carriages",298,307],["country",355,362],["foot",492,496],["vale",680,684],["road",795,799],["carriages",826,835],["country",883,890],["foot",1019,1023],["road",1210,1214],["winding",1232,1239],["banks",1247,1252],["chapel",1375,1381],["bank",1436,1440],["river",1448,1453],["stream",1465,1471],["ground",1531,1537],["seas",1577,1581],["stream",1659,1665],["rock",1698,1702],["bridge",1891,1897],["county",1951,1957],["road",1962,1966],["bridge",2084,2090],["stream",2096,2102],["tarn",2119,2123],["dell",2190,2194],["road",2208,2212],["mountain",2254,2262],["hills",2335,2340],["hill",2451,2455],["land",2546,2550],["trees",2566,2571],["inn",2677,2680],["mountain",2762,2770],["passes",2771,2777],["coast",2893,2898],["road",2911,2915],["mountains",2970,2979],["water",3000,3005]],"pos_words":[["finer",180,185],["perfectly",272,281],["finer",708,713],["perfectly",800,809],["charming",1404,1412],["richer",1501,1507],["remarkable",1763,1773],["magnificent",1796,1807],["striking",1862,1870],["stupendous",2243,2253],["right",2430,2435],["refreshed",2720,2729],["right",2923,2928]],"neg_words":[["object",108,114],["object",636,642],["fear",1572,1576],["conspicuous",2294,2305],["depression",3066,3076]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",2142,2148]],"times":[],"distances":[["about eighteen miles",540,560],["about eighteen miles",1067,1087],["three miles",1627,1638],["a fall twenty feet",1711,1729],["more than a mile",1989,2005],["about 70 feet",2221,2234],["seven and a-half miles",2610,2632]],"loc_advs":[["nowhere",1542,1549],["within",1561,1567],["above",1604,1609]],"spa_preps":[["through",74,81],["near",1270,1274],["under",1317,1322],["over",1682,1686],["around",1816,1822],["into",1925,1929],["above",2074,2079],["close",2195,2200],["between",2484,2491],["amongst",2552,2559],["between",2958,2965]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0290909091,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9949575067},{"para_id":100,"paragraph":"Those magnificent objects,--","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["magnificent",6,17]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.3333333333,"vader_sentiment":0.6,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981828332},{"para_id":101,"paragraph":"---- the two huge peaks That from some other vale peer into this,","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["peaks",18,23],["vale",45,49]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["into",55,59]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.32,"roberta_sentiment":0.9943742752},{"para_id":102,"paragraph":"are the two Pikes of Langdale.

Mill Becks, a farm-house, at which refreshment is usually taken, is soon reached. Here a guide to Dungeon Gill Force, and to the summit of the Pikes, can be obtained. The former is a fall of water, formed by a stream which runs down a fissure in the mountain's side not far above the house. A curious natural arch has been made, by a large stone having rolled from a higher part of the mountain, and got wedge in between the cheeks of rock. Over the bridge thus formed, ladies have been known, like Wordsworth's Idle Shepherd Boy, to possess the intrepidity to pass. Two roads traverse the valley, one of which keeps under the hills on the left, the other takes the middle of the vale;-- the former is to be preferred by those unencumbered with carriages. One mile and a half from Mill Becks, is the little Chapel of Langdale, whence a road strikes up the hill-side, crossing Red Bank into Rydal, or Grasmere. A large sheet of water, lying amongst the meadows, which now comes into sight, is Elterwater Tarn, at the head of which stands Elterwater Hall. The stream feeding the tarn is crossed by a bridge, a short distance above the tarn. Near the bridge are the works of Elterwater Gunpowder Company.

One mile and a-half from Keswick, on an eminence to the right of the old road to Penrith, is a small Druidical circle, measuring 100 feet by 108, consisting of forty - eight stones, some of which are 7 feet high.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Keswick",34,41],["Crow Park",77,86],["Friar Crag",91,101],["Castle Head",273,284],["Borrowdale",310,320],["Keswick",350,357],["Borodale",432,440],["Castle Crag",452,463],["Cat Bells",502,511],["Newlands",618,626],["Castlerigg",650,660],["Keswick",676,683],["Ambleside",691,700],["Derwentwater",763,775],["Bassenthwaite",780,793],["Derwent",830,837],["Skiddaw",910,917],["Keswick",950,957],["Latrigg",1109,1116],["Skiddaw's Cub",1119,1132],["Keswick",1263,1270],["Keswick",1362,1369],["Penrith,",1418,1426]],"geonouns":[["shore",134,139],["foot",150,154],["lake",162,166],["lake",191,195],["vale",197,201],["mountains",219,228],["road",321,325],["lake",538,542],["mountains",579,588],["tower",595,600],["vale",610,614],["summit",635,641],["road",701,705],["lakes",754,759],["vale",807,811],["lake",872,876],["road",1410,1414],["stones",1511,1517]],"pos_words":[["interesting",59,70],["beautiful",168,177],["eminence",257,265],["enchanting",371,381],["like",472,476],["prominent",479,488],["fine",548,552],["well",565,569],["fertile",799,806],["delightful",1178,1188],["finest",1302,1308],["eminence",1377,1385],["right",1393,1398]],"neg_words":[["stranger",1152,1160],["impossible",1220,1230]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",419,423],["forty",1497,1502]],"times":[],"distances":[["about half a mile",327,344],["one mile",662,670],["One mile",1337,1345],["100 feet",1466,1474],["7 feet",1537,1543]],"loc_advs":[["left",302,306],["there",359,364],["there",707,712],["without",1272,1279]],"spa_preps":[["near",141,145],["into",414,418],["over",601,605],["through",812,819],["round",974,979],["behind",1021,1027],["over",1104,1108]],"normalised_sentiment":0.074829932,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987459183},{"para_id":129,"paragraph":"Perhaps an excursion exhibiting more beautiful prospects of rock, wood, and water, than that round Derwentwater, does not exist in the vicinity of the Lakes. It is not more than 10 miles in length, if Grange Bridge be the limit of the ride in that direction; but if the excursion be extended to Bowder Stone, two miles must be added. Leaving Keswick by the Borrowdale Road, Castle Head, Wallow Crag, and Falcon Crag, are successively passed on the left. A hollow in the summit of Wallow Crag is visible from the road. There is a tradition current in the country, that, by means of this hollow, the Countess of Derwentwater effected her escape when the Earl was arrested for high treason, carrying with her a quantity of jewels and other valuables. It has ever since borne the name of the Lady's Rake. Barrow House stands two miles from Keswick, on the left of the road. Behind the house there is a fine cascade 124 feet in height, which may be seen on application at the lodge. A mountain road strikes off at this point to the village of Watendlath, two miles from the deflection. The road, after passing the village, near which there is a tarn, re-enters the Borrowdale road a little beyond Bowder Stone. In making the ascent to the village, splendid views of the lake and Skiddaw are obtained. One mile beyond Barrow, the road having passed under Thrang Crag, is the little inn of Lowdore, behind which is the celebrated Lowdore Waterfall. The grandeur of the rocks around the stream render the scene impressive, whatever may be the state of the weather, but the cascade is dependent in a great measure for its effect on the quantity of water. After heavy rains, the noise of the fall may be heard as far down the lake as Friar Crag. Gowder Crag rises on the left, Shepherd's Crag on the right, of the waterfall. One mile further, Grange Bridge, spanning Borrowdale Beck, is attained. Should the tourist desire to see the curious mask of rock called Bowder Stone, the road into Borrowdale must be continued for a mile further. This immense block, which has evidently rolled from the heights above, stands on a platform of ground, a short distance to the left of the road. A branch road has been made to the stone, which rejoins the Borrowdale road further on. It has been computed to weigh upwards of 1900 tons. Its summit may be gained by means of a ladder which has been affixed to it for the use of strangers.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Derwentwater",99,111],["Lakes",151,156],["Grange Bridge",201,214],["Bowder Stone",295,307],["Keswick",342,349],["Borrowdale Road",357,372],["Castle Head",374,385],["Wallow Crag",387,398],["Falcon Crag",404,415],["Wallow Crag",480,491],["Derwentwater",610,622],["Lady's Rake",788,799],["Barrow House",801,813],["Keswick",836,843],["Watendlath",1038,1048],["Borrowdale",1160,1170],["Bowder Stone",1192,1204],["Skiddaw",1274,1281],["Barrow",1312,1318],["Thrang Crag",1349,1360],["Lowdore",1383,1390],["Lowdore",1423,1430],["Waterfall",1431,1440],["Friar Crag",1724,1734],["Crag",1743,1747],["Shepherd's Crag",1767,1782],["Grange Bridge",1833,1846],["Borrowdale Beck",1857,1872],["Bowder Stone",1952,1964],["Borrowdale",1980,1990],["Borrowdale",2234,2244]],"geonouns":[["rock",60,64],["wood",66,70],["water",76,81],["summit",470,476],["road",512,516],["country",554,561],["road",864,868],["house",881,886],["mountain",980,988],["road",989,993],["point",1014,1019],["village",1027,1034],["road",1085,1089],["village",1109,1116],["tarn",1140,1144],["road",1171,1175],["village",1234,1241],["lake",1265,1269],["road",1324,1328],["inn",1376,1379],["rocks",1462,1467],["stream",1479,1485],["water",1639,1644],["lake",1716,1720],["waterfall",1804,1813],["rock",1940,1944],["road",1970,1974],["ground",2124,2130],["road",2168,2172],["road",2183,2187],["stone",2209,2214],["road",2245,2249],["summit",2318,2324]],"pos_words":[["beautiful",37,46],["splendid",1243,1251],["celebrated",1412,1422],["grandeur",1446,1454],["impressive",1503,1513],["great",1591,1596],["right",1790,1795],["immense",2034,2041],["gained",2332,2338]],"neg_words":[["limit",222,227],["hollow",456,462],["hollow",586,592],["treason",679,686],["noise",1669,1674]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",896,902],["the fall",1678,1686]],"times":[],"distances":[["more than 10 miles",168,186],["two miles",309,318],["two miles",821,830],["124 feet",911,919],["two miles",1050,1059],["One mile",1296,1304],["One mile",1815,1823],["a mile",2013,2019]],"loc_advs":[["left",448,452],["left",852,856],["there",887,892],["near",1118,1122],["there",1129,1134],["left",1761,1765],["above",2093,2098],["left",2156,2160],["upwards",2292,2299]],"spa_preps":[["round",93,98],["beyond",1185,1191],["beyond",1305,1311],["under",1343,1348],["behind",1392,1398],["around",1468,1474],["down",1707,1711],["into",1975,1979]],"normalised_sentiment":0.017699115,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985285997},{"para_id":130,"paragraph":"\" Upon a semicirque of turf-clad ground, A mass of rock, resembling, as it lay Right at the foot of that moist precipice, A stranded ship, with keel upturned, that rests Careless of winds and waves.\"","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["ground",33,39],["rock",51,55],["foot",92,96],["precipice",111,120],["ship",133,137]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.36,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9894346595},{"para_id":131,"paragraph":"Wordsworth.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",0,10]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.8560164571},{"para_id":132,"paragraph":"Close to Bowder Stone, but on the opposite side of the river, from the bank of which it suddenly rises, is an elevation clothed with wood called Castle Crag, so termed from a Roman fortification having once occupied the summit, the faint traces traces of which still remain.

These batteries received extensive additions after the alarm caused by the descent of the notorious Paul Jones in 1778.

The stream which enters at its head is called the Liza, but the river issuing from the lake takes the name of Ehen. This stream is crossed for the first time by those approaching the lake five miles from Whitehaven, and a second time three miles further up, at the village of Ennerdale Bridge, at which is the chapel, and near it two small inns; the foot of the lake is one mile beyond. The first mile and a half of Ennerdale Water is the most picturesque part, and, therefore carriages need not proceed further along the road than this distance, as there is no outlet for them at the upper end of the valley. The pedestrian or horseman will do well to traverse the whole length of the vale, as the mountains round its upper end are thrown into magnificent groups. Long before reaching the head of the lake the scenery becomes wild and desolate. A mile and a half beyond the extremity is the farm house of Gillerthwaite, the last habitation in the vale.

The pretty village of Strands is four miles beyond Gosforth. It was two decent inns, at which boats on the lake my be procured. The ascent of Scawfell Pikes may be conveniently made from the place, by taking a boat to the head of the lake and landing at the foot of the mountain. Wast Water, one mile from Strands, is three and a half miles in length, and about half a mile broad. The deepest part yet discovered is forty - five fathoms. It has never been known to be iced over even in the severest winter. The mountains round this lake rise to a great altitude. The Screes hang over the south-east margin, and form an extraordinary feature in the landscape. Seatallan guards the opposite shore. The road traverses the north-western shore, and, six miles from Strands, arrives at the village of Waterdale Head, which consists merely of a few scattered homesteads and a little chapel. It would be a great accommodation to tourists if there were an inn at this place. Refreshment can, however, be obtained at one of the farm-houses, for which, of course, some remuneration will be given. The panorama of mountains surrounding this level area is strikingly grand. Standing at the head of the lake, the spectator will have Yewbarrow, like the slanting roof of a house, on his left, further up, Kirkfell, and immediately before him Great Gable,-- a little on the right of which is Lingmell, a protrusion from Scawfell-- the Pikes,( the highest land in England,) and Scawfell then follow. Between Yewbarrow and Kirkfell there is the path over Black Sail into Ennerdale, before noticed. A foot road, passing round the head of the lake, and climbing the high ground between the Screes and Scawfell, descends by way of Burnmoor Tarn into Eskdale. Tourists on foot or horseback may proceed to Keswick, fourteen miles distant, by the pass of Sty Head-- the highest in the lake district. The Borrowdale road is entered on the right.

As, however, it is a general rule that lake scenery, in order to be seen to advantage, should be visited in a direction opposite to that in which the waters flow, it would be better to invert this order of approach. Two roads conduct from Penrith to Pooley Bridge, at the foot of the lake about six miles distant, both of which lead through a country abounding in picturesque scenery. One leaves the Keswick road two miles and a-half from Penrith, and, passing through Mr Hasell's park at Dalemain, reaches Ulleswater, three - quarters of a mile above Pooley Bridge. The other road leads along the Shap road to Eamont Bridge, shortly before reaching which, Carleton Hall is seen on the left. After crossing the bridge, by which Westmorland is entered, the first road on the right must be taken. In the angle of the field on the left at this deviation, is King Arthur's Round Table, and a little beyond on the right is Mayborough, both of which antique remaisn have been previously noticed. At Yanwath, two and a-half miles from Penrith, there are the ruins of an ancient Hall, formerly one of the\" noble houses\" of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld. The road, passing through Tirrel and Barton, ultimately arrives at Pooley Bridge, six miles from Penrith - The Eamont is crossed by a stone bridge upon issuing from Ulleswater. There are two small inns, at which boats upon the lake may be procured. On the west of the village is a steep and conical hill, clothed with wood, called Dunmallet, upon which there were formerly the vestiges of a Roman fortification. Winding walks lead to the summit, from which a fine view of the lake is commanded. About half a mile from Pooley, on the east side of the lake, is a villa named Eusemere, which for some time was the residence of the late William Wilberforce. From Pooley Bridge to Patterdale, a distance of ten miles the road traverses the west margin of Ulleswater. The lake itself is nine miles in length, and is partitioned by the mountains into three separate chambers, or reaches, as they are locally termed, no two of which can be seen at once from any point near the margin. Its extreme width is about three - quarters of a mile. The first reach, commencing at the foot, is terminated on the left by Hallin Fell, which stretches forward to a promontory, from the opposite side called Skelley Neb, upon whihc stands Mr Marshall's house, Halsteads. The middle and longest reach is closed in by Birk Fell on the left, and on the right by Stybarrow Crag, far away above which\" the dark brow of the mighty Helvellyn\" rises into thin air. The little island, called House Holm, spots the water exactly at the termination of this section of the lake. The highest reach is the smallest and narrowest, but the mingled grandeur and beauty which surround it, are beyond the power of the liveliest imagination to depict. Four or five islands dimple the surface, and by their diminutive size impress more deeply upon the beholder the vastness of the hills which tower above them; Stybarrow Crag, and other offshoots from Helvellyn on one side, Birk Fell and Place Fell on the other, springing from the lake's margin almost at one bound, shut in this terrestrial paradise.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",72,81],["Penrith,",86,94],["Penrith",402,409],["Pooley Bridge",413,426],["Keswick",563,570],["Penrith,",602,610],["Dalemain",652,660],["Ulleswater",670,680],["Pooley Bridge",715,728],["Shap",761,765],["Eamont Bridge",774,787],["Carleton Hall",820,833],["Westmorland",891,902],["King Arthur's Round Table",1018,1043],["Mayborough",1081,1091],["Yanwath",1156,1163],["Penrith,",1191,1199],["Threlkeld",1291,1300],["Pooley Bridge",1369,1382],["Penrith",1399,1406],["Eamont",1413,1419],["Ulleswater",1467,1477],["Dunmallet",1633,1642],["Pooley Bridge",1961,1974],["Patterdale",1978,1988],["Ulleswater",2052,2062],["Halsteads",2540,2549],["Birk Fell",2596,2605],["Stybarrow Crag",2639,2653],["Helvellyn",2705,2714],["Holm",2769,2773],["Stybarrow Crag",3170,3184],["Helvellyn",3211,3220],["Birk Fell",3234,3243],["Place Fell",3248,3258]],"geonouns":[["lake",11,15],["road",102,106],["passes",130,136],["shore",156,161],["lake",202,206],["waters",313,319],["roads",383,388],["foot",435,439],["lake",447,451],["country",506,513],["road",571,575],["park",644,648],["road",740,744],["road",766,770],["bridge",874,880],["road",925,929],["field",978,983],["houses",1267,1273],["road",1306,1310],["stone",1436,1441],["bridge",1442,1448],["inns",1499,1503],["boats",1514,1519],["lake",1529,1533],["village",1570,1577],["hill",1601,1605],["wood",1620,1624],["summit",1740,1746],["lake",1778,1782],["lake",1852,1856],["residence",1913,1922],["road",2018,2022],["lake",2068,2072],["mountains",2131,2140],["point",2256,2261],["foot",2369,2373],["promontory",2446,2456],["house",2533,2538],["brow",2686,2690],["island",2748,2754],["water",2785,2790],["lake",2841,2845],["islands",3025,3032],["hills",3140,3145],["tower",3152,3157],["lake",3292,3296]],"pos_words":[["advantage",239,248],["better",338,344],["lead",491,495],["picturesque",527,538],["leads",745,750],["right",937,942],["right",1072,1077],["noble",1261,1266],["lead",1728,1732],["right",2630,2635],["mighty",2698,2704],["grandeur",2912,2920],["beauty",2925,2931],["impress",3082,3089],["paradise",3352,3360]],"neg_words":[["deviation",1004,1013],["ruins",1214,1219],["steep",1583,1588],["vestiges",1679,1687],["dark",2681,2685]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",1256,1260],["a fine",1759,1765]],"times":[["The first",2334,2343]],"distances":[["about six miles",452,467],["two miles",576,585],["a mile",702,708],["two and a-half miles",1165,1185],["six miles",1384,1393],["half a mile",1803,1814],["ten miles",2004,2013],["nine miles",2083,2093],["a mile",2326,2332]],"loc_advs":[["between",107,114],["opposite",283,291],["left",849,853],["left",991,995],["beyond",1058,1064],["there",1200,1205],["there",1655,1660],["left",2396,2400],["forward",2433,2440],["opposite",2467,2475],["left",2613,2617],["above",2664,2669]],"spa_preps":[["between",64,71],["along",137,142],["through",496,503],["through",624,631],["above",709,714],["along",751,756],["through",1320,1327],["into",2141,2145],["near",2262,2266],["about",2300,2305],["away",2659,2663],["into",2722,2726],["beyond",2955,2961],["above",3158,3163]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0308641975,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9785692692},{"para_id":204,"paragraph":"\" Abrupt and sheer the mountains sink At once the level brink.\"","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["mountains",23,32]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["sink",33,37]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.125,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9762969613},{"para_id":205,"paragraph":"Leaving Pooley Bridge by the high road, Waterfoot is passed on the right about a mile from the bridge, and Rampsbeck Lodge, on the left, about two miles from the same place.

Marshall, Esq., is seen on the left,-- the grounds circling which are beautifully laid out. The wood at the foot of Hallin Fell, on the other shore, has a pleasing effect. A mile from Halsteads, Gowbarrow Park is entered. This park, which contains upwards of a thousand acres, must attract the attention of the most careless observer, by its\" grace of forest chasms decayed,\" and innumerable sylvan groups of great beauty still remain, round which herds of deer will be seen bounding. It belongs to Henry Howard, Esq. of Greystoke Castle, to whom it was devised by Charles, 11th Duke of Norfolk, his uncle. The Duke's predecessor erected upon an eminence in the park a hunting-box in the castellated style, which is called Lyulph's Tower; it commands a splendid view of the lake. About five and a-half miles from Pooley Bridge, a stream is crossed by a small bridge, a mile above which, in a rocky dell, is a waterfall of considerable volume, called Airey Force. The banks of the stream, which are thickly sown with trees, become exceedingly precipitous as the cascade is approached. Two wooden bridges are thrown across the stream, one above, the other below, the fall. Glencoin Beck, issuing from Linking Dale Head, runs under the road a mile beyond Airey bridge, and forms the line of demarcation between Cumberland and Westmorland. The highest reach of lake is now unfolded to the view. The road soon afterwards passes under Stybarrow Crag, at which point it has been much widened,-- formerly it was a narrow path between the steep mountain and the water's edge. An ancestor of the Mounseys of Goldrill Cottage acquired the title of King of Patterdale, from having successfully repulsed a body of Scotch moss-troopers at the place, with the aid of a few villages. His residence was at that time Patterdale hall, but a few years ago the patrimonial estate was sold to Mr Marshall of Leeds. The brook from Glenridding is then crossed. Helvellyn may be ascended from this valley for which purpose a guide should be obtained at Patterdale. The path to the summit lies for a considerable distance by the side of Glenridding Beck. On the left is Glenridding House, Rev. Mr Askew; Patterdale Hall is passed on the right, and the village of Patterdale is soon afterwards reached. The Churchyard, in which lie interred the remains of the unfortunate Charles Gough, contains a yew-tree of remarkable size. At the Inn, where there is excellent accommodation, guides may be had to any of the mountains in the vicinity, and boats procured for excursions upon the lake. A few days might be pleasantly spent at this place, in investigating the hidden beauties of the neighbourhood.

Helton is rather more than a mile beyond, and Bampton is nearly four miles further. The grammar school at this village has been long in great repute. Shap, a straggling village on the mail road between Kendal and Penrith, is five miles distant. The road passes near the ruins of Shap Abbey, lying on the banks of the Lowther, now bare, but once occupied by a thick forest. This abbey, anciently called Heppe, was founded by Thomas, the son of Gospatrick, for monks of the Premonstratensian order, about the year 1150. It was dedicated to St Magdalen. Upon the dissolution, the abbey and manor were granted to Thomas Lord Wharton, from whose descendant, the Duke of Wharton, an ancestor of the Earl of Lonsdale, purchased them. The only part left standing is the church tower. From the vestiges of buildings yet visible, the abbey appears to have been extensive. In the vicinity of Shap are two of those rude structures to which no certain date can be assigned, and which are therefore usually referred to the primitive times of the Druids. Karl Lofts, the name of one, consists of two parallel lines of unhewn masses of granite, half a mile long by sixty or seventy feet broad, terminating at the south extremity in a small circle of similar blocks.

A broad promontory enters the lake at this place, and approaches within 200 or 300 yards of the other margin. The mountains surrounding the head of this lake present a magnificent contour. They consist of High Street and Kidsty Pike, with their nameless dependencies. The little chapel of Mardale stands close to the road about a mile above the lake, and over against it is a neat white house, called Chapel Hill, the residence of a yeoman named Holme. The ancestor of this family came originally from Stockholm, and landed in England in the train of the Conqueror. He was rewarded with an estate in the Northamptonshire, where the family were seated until the reign of King John, at which period, its head, flying from his enemies, flying from his enemies, concealed himself in a cavity( to this day called Hugh's cave) in one of the hill sides. The estate on which his descendent resides was purchased by the fugitive. Having wound round a rocky screen, a few houses, called collectively Mardale Green,( amongst which there is a small inn,) are seen thinly sown over the floor of the narrow valley.

Of these, the station from which the ascent may be most readily be made is Strands, at the foot of Wast Water. A boat being taken up the lake, will land the pedestrian at the foot of Lingmell, which projects towards the water. The top of Lingmell being almost gained, a turn must be made to the right, and that direction persevered in for three - quarters of a mile. Deflections to the right and left in succession will place the hardy climber upon Scawfell Pikes. From Borrowdale the best course is to pursue the Wastdale road, until Sty Head Tarn is reached. Leaving this tarn on the left, and bending you way towards Sprinkling Tarn, which must also be kept on the left, a turn to the right must shortly be made conducting to a pass called East Haws, having on the left, Hanging Knott, and on the right Wastdale Broad Crag. The summit of Scawfell Pikes is in view from this place, but much exertion will be required before either will be reached. Great End will have to be ascended, and continuing along the summit-ridge, some rocky eminences will be passed on the left. A considerable descent must then be made, and two small hollows crossed, from the second of which the trigonometrical station on the Pikes will be reached. The two elevations of Scawfell and Scawfell Pikes, though not more than three - quarters of a mile distant from each other in a direct line, are separated by a fearful chasm, called Mickle Dore, which compels a circuit to be made of two miles in passing from one to the other. The passage by Mickle Dore, though dangerous, is not impassable, as some of the adventurous dalesman can testify. All vegetation but that of lichens has forsaken the summits of Scawfell Pikes and its rival;\" Cushions or tufts of moss parched and brown,\" says Wordsworth with his usual poetical feeling,\" appear between the huge blocks and stones that lie on heaps on all sides to a great distance, like skeletons or bones of the earth not needed at the creation, and there left to be covered with never-dying liches, which the clouds and dews nourish and adorn with colours of exquisite beauty.

The mountains having lost the shapes they possessed when viewed from beaneath, are only to be recognized by those acquainted with the locality of each; however, with the aid of his compass, map, and our directions, the enquiring gazer will be able to assign its name to most of them. Turning to the south, Morecambe Bay and the Lancashire coast to a great extent are seen, and on clear days the prospect comprehends a portion of the Welsh Highlands. Scawfell intercepts the view of Wast Water and part of the Screes. To the left Eskdale and Miterdale are seen contributing their waters to the ocean. Furness and the Isle of Walney are visible in the same direction, as well as Devoke Water, placed on an elevated moor, beyond which Black Combe is a prominent object. Still more to the east Wyrnose, Wetherlam, Coniston Old Man, with the rest of the mountains at the head of Eskdale, Seathwaite, and Little Langdale are conspicuous. Bowfell, obscuring Langdale, appears in the east, and beyond, part of the middle of Windermere. Far away, beyond, are the Yorkshire hills with Ingleborough, the monarch of them all, plainly visible. To the left of Bowfell, Langdale Pikes are descried, and in the east the eye rests upon Hill vell, High Street, Wansfell, Fairfield, Seat Sandal, and Helvellyn in succession. In the north Skiddaw and Saddleback cannot be mistaken, beyond which, the blue mountains of Scotland bound the prospect. Immediately beneath the spectator he will perceive Sty Head Tarn dwindled to a little spot. Great End conceals Borrowdale, and a little to the left rises the mighty mass of Great Gable. Castle Crag, Grange Crag, and Gate Crag, shut out the greater part of Derwentwater. In the north-west are a series of hills, the principal of which are, Causey Pike, Grizedale Pike, Maiden Mawr, Hindscarth and Robinson. Then come the Buttermere and Crummock mountains, with Grasmoor conspicuously visible. Nearer are the Pillar, Hay Cock, High Style, and Red Pike. Westward the eye sinks into the depths of Wastdale, round which are piked Kirkfell, Yewbarrow, Seatallan, and Buckbarrow.

It may be well, perhaps, to mention, that ponies can be used for a great portion of the way if the lowland be quitted at Grasmere, a facility of which none of the other paths will admit. The ascent from Wythburn, though the shortest, is the steepest. A guide can be procured at the little inn which stands near the chapel, but as the path is easily discovered without his assistance, many persons will feel inclined to dispense with this restraint upon their motions and conversation. The path, which begins to ascend almost at the inn-door, will be pointed out by the people of the inn. A spring, called Brownrigg's Well, issuing from the ground within 300 yards of the summit, sends out a stream, which, after rushing violently down the mountain's side, crosses the highway 200 or 300 yards from the Horse's Head at Wythburn. Taking this stream as a guide, the stranger need have no fear of losing his way, for Helvellyn Man is a little to the left, at the distance we have mentioned, above its source.

The latter glen is to be preferred, as the stream flowing through it, which has its rise in the Red Tarn, may be taken as a guide up the mountain. This tarn lies 600 feet immediately below the highest elevation, fenced in on the south-east, by a ridge of rock called Striding Edge, and on the north-west by a similar barrier, called Swirrel Edge. Cathcedecum, the termination of the latter, must be ascended, and the ridge crossed, in order to attain the object of the climber's ambition. Although the path along this ridge may be somewhat startling, there is no real danger to be apprehended. Sometimes, from mistake or fool-hardiness, Striding Edge is taken' but this is at once appalling and perilous, for at one part the path is not more than two yards broad, with a tremendous precipice on either side. It was at this spot that Charles Gough met with the accident which caused his death. The Edge being passed, little exertion is required to place the weary pedestrian by the side of Helvellyn Man-- as the pile of stones on the summit is called-- thence to gaze on the wonderful display of mountains and lakes which every where surround him. This Man. and that on a lower elevation to the north, form the separating landmarks between Cumberland and Westmorland. And now, as to the view, and the multitudinous objects within its range. Northwards, Keppel Cove Tarn is perceived, having on the right Catchedecam. Beyond the extremity of the tarn Saddleback rears its huge form, a little to the left of which is Skiddaw. Between the two, and in the north-west, a portion of the Solway Firth is descried, and the extreme distance is bounded by the Scottish mountains. Turning eastwards, the Red Tarn below its\" huge namless rock,\" lies between Swirrel Edge on the left, and Striding Edge on the right. Beyond is the crooked form of Ulleswater, on the left margin of which are Gowbarrow Park and Stybarrow Crag, whilst the right is bounded by the dwindled precipices of Place Fell, Beck Fell, and Swarth Fell. High Street and High Bell are seen in the east over Striding Edge. Kirkstone, Fairsfield, and Dolly Waggon Pike, are more to the south. A portion of Windermere is seen over the last named hill, whilst in a clear atmosphere, Lancaster Castle can be descried beyond Windermere. Esthwaite water is directly south, and beyond is the sea in the Bay of Morecambe. In the south-west, the Old Man stands guarding the right shore of Coniston Lake. On the right is the assemblage of hills termed Coniston Fells, whilst Black Combe, beheld through Wrynose Gap, lifts its dreary summit in the distance. The\" gorgeous pavillions\" of the Buttermere mountains are pitched in the west, amongst which the Pillar and Grasmere are prominent. Cat Bells are visible, though Derwentwater, upon the west margin of which they stand, is hidden. Our old acquaintance, Honister Crag, may be seen in a hollow, a little to the left of Cat Bells. From the lower Man views of Thirlmere and Bassenthwaite Lake are commanded, both of which are concealed by the breast of the mountains from those on the highest Man.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Patterdale",5,15],["Grisedale",30,39],["Glenridding",44,55],["Helvellyn",100,109],["Red Tarn",207,215],["Striding Edge",378,391],["Swirrel Edge",444,456],["Striding Edge",748,761],["Helvellyn",1100,1109],["Cumberland",1351,1361],["Westmorland",1366,1377],["Keppel Cove Tarn",1464,1480],["Catchedecam",1515,1526],["Saddleback",1561,1571],["Skiddaw",1626,1633],["Solway Firth",1692,1704],["Red Tarn",1804,1812],["Swirrel Edge",1857,1869],["Striding Edge",1887,1900],["Ulleswater",1945,1955],["Gowbarrow Park",1989,2003],["Stybarrow Crag",2008,2022],["Place Fell",2082,2092],["Swarth Fell",2109,2120],["High Street",2122,2133],["Bell",2143,2147],["Striding Edge",2174,2187],["Kirkstone",2189,2198],["Pike",2229,2233],["Windermere",2271,2281],["Lancaster Castle",2346,2362],["Windermere",2386,2396],["Esthwaite",2398,2407],["Morecambe",2469,2478],["Old Man",2503,2510],["Coniston Lake",2546,2559],["Coniston Fells",2608,2622],["Black Combe",2631,2642],["Wrynose Gap",2659,2670],["Buttermere",2746,2756],["Pillar",2810,2816],["Grasmere",2821,2829],["Cat Bells",2845,2854],["Derwentwater",2875,2887],["Honister Crag",2964,2977],["Cat Bells",3028,3037],["Thirlmere",3067,3076],["Bassenthwaite Lake",3081,3099]],"geonouns":[["glens",21,26],["glen",122,126],["stream",154,160],["mountain",248,256],["tarn",263,267],["ridge",357,362],["rock",366,370],["ridge",528,533],["path",613,617],["ridge",629,634],["path",836,840],["precipice",893,902],["stones",1131,1137],["summit",1145,1151],["mountains",1207,1216],["lakes",1221,1226],["tarn",1556,1560],["mountains",1770,1779],["rock",1837,1841],["precipices",2068,2078],["hill",2310,2314],["water",2408,2413],["sea",2451,2454],["shore",2537,2542],["hills",2595,2600],["summit",2689,2695],["mountains",2757,2766],["hollow",2996,3002],["mountains",3164,3173]],"pos_words":[["wonderful",1186,1195],["right",1509,1514],["right",1908,1913],["right",2035,2040],["clear",2328,2333],["right",2531,2536],["right",2568,2573],["gorgeous",2718,2726],["prominent",2834,2843]],"neg_words":[["lies",268,272],["object",566,572],["startling",651,660],["danger",679,685],["mistake",721,728],["fool",732,736],["appalling",792,801],["perilous",806,814],["death",997,1002],["weary",1068,1073],["lies",1844,1848],["crooked",1929,1936],["dreary",2682,2688]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["600 feet",273,281]],"loc_advs":[["there",662,667],["within",1434,1440],["left",1609,1613],["below",1813,1818],["between",1849,1856],["left",1877,1881],["left",1964,1968],["beyond",2437,2443],["left",3020,3024]],"spa_preps":[["through",169,176],["below",294,299],["along",618,623],["between",1343,1350],["over",2169,2173],["over",2290,2294],["beyond",2379,2385],["through",2651,2658],["amongst",2792,2799]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0133779264,"vader_sentiment":-0.86,"roberta_sentiment":0.9954202175},{"para_id":226,"paragraph":"This unfortunate\" young lover of nature\" attempted to cross Helvellyn from Patterdale one day in the srping of 1805, after a fall of snow had partially concealed the path, and rendered it dangerous.

According to the Government surveyors, its height is 3022 feet above the sea; upon one part of it granite is to be found, but the great mass of this mountain, as well as of Saddleback, is composed of a dark schistose stone. It is seldom ascended from any other place but Keswick, at which town every thing necessary for the expedition will be furnished. The Penrith road must be pursued for half a-mile, to a bridge which spans the Greta Bank, and skirts Latrigg, at an elevation sufficient to command delightful views of Keswick vale. \" This road,\" says Green,\" is unequalled for scenic beauty in the environs of Keswick.\" Traversing a plantation of wood, it enters another road, upon which the visitor, turning to the right, must proceed for a few yards only, as, just beyond a gate across the way, the road to be taken turns to the left at right angles, by the side of a fence, to a hollow at the foot of the steepest hill on the ascent, having on the right a deep ravine, down which a transparent stream is seen falling. The path then holds along for about a mile by the side of a wall, which it crosses, and proceeds in a direct line forward, whilst the wall diverges to the right.

A view will always be indistinct in proportion as it is extensive. Nothing can exceed the charming appearance of the valley and town of Keswick, of Derwentwater and its surrounding eminences, when beheld from the mountain's side; the lake especially, with its bays and islands is nowhere seen to such advantage. In consequence of Skiddaw being exposed to the blasts of the west wind from the Irish Channel, the visitor will not be inclined, from the intense cold, to stay long on the summit; we shall therefore proceed to run over hastily the names of the principal objects which are visible from that elevated position. In the north, beyond the lowlands of Cumberland, in which Carlisle and its cathedral are perceived, the Solway Frith is seen, on the further side of which the Scottish mountains are displayed in fine arrangement. Criffel is seen over Skiddaw Far Man, and the Moffat and Cheviot hills stretch away to the right. Dumfries is visible at the mouth of the frith. In the north-west, over High Pike and Long Brow, the vale and town of Penrith are beheld, with Cross Fell( 2901 feet) beyond. Directly east is the rival summit of Saddleback, separated by the tract called Skiddaw Forest from the mountain on which the spectator is standing. Hevellyn is in the south-east; beyond, Ingleborough in Yorkshire is dimly descried. Between Helvellyn and Saddleback, Place Fell, at the head of Ulleswater, and High Street are visible. When the atmosphere is clear, Lancaster Castle may be seen in the south-east. Derwentwater is not comprehended in the view from the highest Man, being concealed by some of the other eminences of Skiddaw, but from the third man a perfect bird's - eye perspective of that lake is obtained. In the south\" there is a succession of five several ranges of mountain seen out-topping each other, from a stripe of the lovely valley to the highest of the Pikes. Grisedale in one grand line stretches from the inclosures at Braithwaite to it Pike, succeeded in the second range by Barrow Stile End, and Utterside. Rising from the fields of Newlands, third range commences with Rolling End, ascending from which are Causey Pike, Scar Crag, Top Sail, Ill Crags, and Grasmoor,-- the latter lessening the Pike of Grisedale by appearing over its top. The fourth line in this wild combination is composed of Cat Bells, Maiden Moor, Dalehead, Hindsgarth, Robinson, High Crag, High Stile, and Red Pike. The fifth and last is that sublime chain of summits, extending on the south from Coniston to Ennerdale on the north; amongst these the High Pile or Man, standing towering over the rest, has on the left Great End, Hanging Knott, Bow Fell, and the Fell of Coniston; on the right, Lingmell Crags, Great Gable, Kirk Fell, Black Sail, the Pillar, the Steeple, and the Hay Cock, with Yewbarrow and part of the Screes through the pass at Black Sail. On the right of Grisedale Pike and Hobcarten Crag is low Fell, succeeded by Whinfield Fell, over which, in a clear atmosphere, may be observed more than the northern half of the Isle of Man; and on a mistless sunny evening, even Ireland may be seen. The north-west end or foot of Bassenthwaite Water is seen here, the head being obscured by Longside.\" Workington can be seen at the mouth of the Derwent in the west, and more to the north the coast towns of Maryport and Allonby. The town and castle of Cockermouth are perceived, over the extremity of Bassenthwaite Lake, seated on the Cocker.

The most southerly is termed Pike o' Stickle, and is lower by 100 feet than Harrison Stickle, which is 2400 feet in height. They are of a porphyritic structure, and, on account of their steepness, are somewhat difficult to ascend. They are conspicuous objects from the upper end of Windermere, and from the road leading from Kendal to Ambleside. They are usually ascending during the Langdale excursion,( as to which see page 277,) but pedestrians would have no difficulty in making the ascent from the Stake, or from Grasmere through Easdale. The easiest mode, however, is that from Langdale. A guide can be procured at Milbecks, where tourists commonly take some refreshment. The path pursues a peat road leading to Stickle Tarn, well known to the angler for its fine trout, which lies under a lofty ridge of rock called Pavey Ark. This tarn must be left on the right, and a streamlet which runs down the hill-side taken as a guide. The path becomes at this part exceedingly steep, but a little patient exertion will soon place the tourist on the summit of Harrison Stickle. Though of considerably inferior elevation to the other mountains we have described, the views from this spot are extremely fine. Looking eastward, Helvellyn, Seat Sandal, and Fairfield bound the prospect; and, in the north-west and north, Skiddaw and Saddleback are seen in the distance. Stickle Tarn is immediately below the eye, guarded by the frowning heights of Pavey Ark. In the south-east are the hills around the valley of Ambleside, beyond those at the head of Troutbeck and Kentmere. In turning to the south, the eye is attracted by the valley of Great Langdale, containing Elterwater and Loughrigg Tarn, and terminated by Windermere, with Curwen's Isle and the other islands diversifying its smooth surface. Loughrigg Fell conceals a portion of the head of the lake as well as the town of Ambleside. Underbarrow Scar, near Kendal, is seen over Bowness. Esthwaite Water is seen in the south-south-east, and close at hand, towards the right, is the bluff summit of Wetherlam End. A small part of the sea is embraced in the view in the this direction.

It contains upwards of thirty acres. Mr. Curwen's house, of a circular shape, is upon it. From the summit of the ascent from the Ferry, Ingleborough is visible. The Old Man is in sight. This lake is two miles in length, and one - third of a mile in breadth. The scenery around it is pleasing, but destitute of any features of grandeur. A peninsula swells from the west shore, and pleasantly relieves the monotonous regularity of the margin. The stream which issues from it, is called the Cunsey; it enters Windermere a mile and a half below the ferry. Many handsome villas enliven the banks of the lake. In a pond near the head, is a diminutive floating island, having upon it several small trees. 7 Sawrey vill. along the east shore of Esthwaite Lake, and round its head 11 Langdale Pikes are visible: on the right is the Pass Dunmail Raise, to east of which are Helvellyn, Seat Sandal, and Fairfield.

To Ulverston, 16 miles. 13 Hawkshead is a small but ancient market-town at the head of the valley of Esthwaite. The old hall where the Abbots of Furness held their Courts, is a farm-house lying about a mile distant. St. Michael's Church, a structure of great antiquity, is placed on a rocky eminence immediately over the town, commanding fine views of the adjacent country. --\" the grassy churchyard hangs Upon a slope above the village school.\" This school was founded in 1585, by Archibishop Sandys, a member of an ancient family still seated in the neighbourhood. The poet Wordsworth, and his brother, the late Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, were educated here. In the verses of the former, allusion is frequently made to \" The antique market village, where days were passed My school-days.\" At the termination of the ascent, the lake and vale of Coniston, hemmed in by magnificent mountains, break upon the eye with almost theatrical surprise.

is an ancient borough and neat market-town of 7275 inhabitants, seated at the junction of the Cocker with the Derwent, from which circumstance it derives its name. It sent two representatives to Parliament as early as the twenty - third year of Edward I., and, by the Reform Act, it has still the privilege of returning two members. The honour and castle of Cockermouth belong to General Wyndham. The ruins of this ancient fortress, formerly a place great strength, are seated on a bold eminence which rises from the east bank of the Cocker. It was built soon after the Norman Conquest by Waldieve, first lord of Allerdale, of whose successors it was for many centuries the baronial seat. In 1648, it was garrisoned for King Charles, but being afterwards taken by the Parliamentarians, was dismantled by them, and has ever since lain in ruins, except a small part at present occupied by Lieut. - General Wyndham. The Gateway Tower, embellished with the arms of the Umfravilles, Multons, Lucies, Percies, and Nevilles, is a striking object. On the north side of the town is a tumulus, called Toots Hill; one mile to the west are the remains of a rampart and ditch of an encampment, 750 feet in circuit, called Fitt's Wood. On the summit of a hill at Pap Castle, a village one mile and a-half south-west of Cockermouth, are the traces of a Roman castrum. A great number of antique remains have been discovered at this place, and in the neighbourhood. The castle was subsequently the residence of the above-mentioned Waldieve, by whom it was demolished, and the materials used in the construction of Cockermouth Castle. Tickell, the poet, Addison's friend, was born at Bridekirk, two miles distant.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Cockermouth",0,11],["Cocker",106,112],["Derwent",122,129],["Cockermouth",370,381],["Cocker",546,552],["Castle",1265,1271],["Cockermouth",1317,1328],["Cockermouth",1609,1620],["Castle",1621,1627],["Bridekirk",1678,1687]],"geonouns":[["market",43,49],["town",50,54],["junction",90,98],["castle",360,366],["bank",534,538],["seat",695,699],["town",1077,1081],["summit",1241,1247],["hill",1253,1257],["village",1275,1282],["castle",1465,1471],["residence",1493,1502]],"pos_words":[["neat",38,42],["privilege",309,318],["great",462,467],["eminence",499,507],["striking",1035,1043],["great",1367,1372]],"neg_words":[["ruins",413,418],["ruins",849,854],["object",1044,1050]],"events":[],"dates":[["the twenty - third year",230,253],["many centuries",667,681],["1648",704,708]],"times":[],"distances":[["one mile",1115,1123],["750 feet",1193,1201],["one mile",1283,1291],["two miles",1689,1698]],"loc_advs":[["above",1510,1515]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0189873418,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981688261},{"para_id":272,"paragraph":"Cockermouth is the birth-place of the poet Wordsworth, who was born on the 7th April, 1770.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Cockermouth",0,11],["Wordsworth",43,53]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["the 7th April, 1770",71,90]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9963271022},{"para_id":273,"paragraph":"The seats in the neighbourhood are-- Dovenby Hall( Mrs Dykes), three miles north-west; Tallentire Hall( William Browne, Esq.), three and a half miles north; Isel Hall( Sir Wilfrid Lawson Bt.)., three and a half miles north-east; Woodhall( J. s.

Here is a powerful brook, which dashes among rocks through a deep glen hung over every side with a rich and happy intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and hollies decked with honey suckles; and fallow deer glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets. Lyulph's Tower, a hunting seat, the property of Mr Howard. There is a splendid view of the lake from the front. List, ye who pass by Lyulph's Tower At eve; how softly then Doth Aire Force, that torrent hoarse, Speak from the woody glen! Fit music for a solemn vale! And holler seems the ground To him who catches on the gale The spirit of a mournful tale Embodied in the sound. Wordsworth's Somnambulist. 13 \u00bd 11 cr. Airey Bridge. Road to Keswick through Matterdale 10 \u00bd miles. A mile above the bridge the stream is precipitated down a fall of eighty feet. Two wooden bridges are thrown across the brook, one above the other, below the fall. The banks are beautifully wooded, and the scenery around the inconceivable magnificence. Birk Fell rises rapidly from the opposite margin.","file_id":"1853_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",52,61],["Eamont Bridge",177,190],["Kendal",206,212],["Yanwath",255,262],["King Arthur's Round Table",291,316],["Yanwath",338,345],["Westmorland",412,423],["Pooley Bridge",588,601],["Penrith",648,655],["Ulles Water",722,733],["Westmorland",752,763],["Penrith",925,932],["Penrith",947,954],["Penrith",961,968],["Penrith",983,990],["Keswick",1008,1015],["Keswick",1071,1078],["Dalemain",1086,1094],["Park",1095,1099],["Dalemain",1101,1109],["Dacre",1162,1167],["Dunmallet",1168,1177],["Pooley Bridge",1219,1232],["Dunmallet",1436,1445],["Ulles Water",1477,1488],["Old Church",1920,1930],["Elizabeth",2060,2069],["Watermillock",2251,2263],["Halsteads",2269,2278],["Swarth Fell",2418,2429],["Corby",2583,2588],["Sandwyke",2655,2663],["Gowbarrow Park",2754,2768],["Gowbarrow Park",2777,2791],["Wordsworth",2798,2808],["Lyulph's Tower",3164,3178],["Lyulph's Tower",3297,3311],["Wordsworth",3542,3552],["Keswick",3603,3610],["Matterdale",3619,3629],["Birk Fell",3895,3904]],"geonouns":[["road",137,141],["road",198,202],["building",375,383],["hall",470,474],["church",545,551],["boat",818,822],["lake",879,883],["road",891,895],["road",1016,1020],["foot",1268,1272],["lake",1280,1284],["inns",1333,1337],["post",1359,1363],["boats",1375,1380],["lake",1426,1430],["hill",1449,1453],["village",1463,1470],["lake",1499,1503],["promontories",1614,1626],["islands",1758,1765],["lake",1965,1969],["promontory",2308,2318],["shore",2379,2384],["lake",2494,2498],["bay",2506,2509],["park",2542,2546],["stream",2704,2710],["lake",2739,2743],["brook",2873,2878],["rocks",2899,2904],["glen",2920,2924],["wood",2991,2995],["beds",3006,3010],["lawns",3132,3137],["seat",3190,3194],["lake",3255,3259],["pass",3289,3293],["glen",3395,3399],["vale",3424,3428],["ground",3451,3457],["bridge",3659,3665],["stream",3670,3676],["bridges",3732,3739],["brook",3762,3767],["banks",3810,3815]],"pos_words":[["right",229,234],["good",387,391],["deserving",499,508],["right",567,572],["recommended",669,680],["advantage",737,746],["good",1409,1413],["distinction",1903,1914],["well",2173,2177],["fine",2537,2541],["well",2628,2632],["lover",2814,2819],["powerful",2864,2872],["rich",2953,2957],["happy",2962,2967],["luxuriant",3014,3023],["splendid",3234,3242],["beautifully",3820,3831],["magnificence",3881,3893]],"neg_words":[["ruin",494,498],["stranger",859,867],["unequal",1667,1674],["regret",2096,2102],["refused",2154,2161],["deprived",2238,2246],["hung",2925,2929],["torrent",3358,3365],["solemn",3417,3423],["mournful",3505,3513],["fall",3700,3704],["inconceivable",3867,3880]],"events":[],"dates":[["24",63,65],["\u00bd",66,67],["three quarters",115,129],["three quarters",628,642],["23",992,994],["1",1036,1037],["22",1079,1081],["\u00bd",1082,1083],["2",1084,1085],["18",1472,1474],["5",1490,1491],["1558",2022,2026],["17",2248,2250],["7",2265,2266],["\u00bd",2267,2268],["15",2745,2747],["9",2770,2771],["\u00bd",2772,2773],["\u00bd",3572,3573],["11",3574,3576],["the fall",3796,3804]],"times":[["hours",2847,2852]],"distances":[["five miles and",100,114],["two miles",271,280],["a mile",450,456],["a mile",573,579],["five miles and",613,627],["three or four miles",795,814],["two miles",1025,1034],["a quarter of a mile",1233,1252],["nine miles",1530,1540],["a mile",1547,1553],["about 200 feet",1564,1578],["10 \u00bd miles",3630,3640],["A mile",3642,3648],["eighty feet",3708,3719]],"loc_advs":[["left",324,328],["across",868,874],["left",1313,1317],["near",1454,1458],["left",1863,1867],["upwards",2599,2606],["here",2997,3001],["above",3649,3654],["above",3773,3778],["below",3790,3795]],"spa_preps":[["below",148,153],["beyond",244,250],["beyond",580,586],["into",1627,1631],["around",1799,1805],["opposite",2370,2378],["below",2433,2438],["between",2452,2459],["opposite",2672,2680],["among",2893,2898],["through",2905,2912],["over",2930,2934],["over",3123,3127],["through",3142,3149],["through",3611,3618],["down",3693,3697],["across",3751,3757],["around",3856,3862],["opposite",3928,3936]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0163934426,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.5168980956},{"para_id":284,"paragraph":"Lyulph's Tower, a hunting seat, the property of Mr Howard.

There were formerly two monastic institutions in Preston, one called the Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, the other a monastery of Greyfriars. The last was occupied as a prison until about fifty years ago, and traces of it yet remain. During the civil wars Preston was first occupied by the Royal Party, but was quickly taken by the Parliamentary forces, and the mayor killed in the assault. It was afterwards retaken by the Earl of Derby, who demolished the defences. At Ribbleton Moor, near Preston, the Duke of Hamilton was defeated, in 1648, by Cromwell; and, in 1715, the friends of the Pretender were routed by Generals Willes and Carpenter at the same spot. Preston contains five churchs and one chapel, belonging to the Established Church, and numerous chapels belonging to dissenting bodies. It was also a guild-hall, a town-hall, a corn exchange, a cloth and market-hall, assembly rooms, a theatre,&amp; c. What are called the\" Guilds\" of Present are held every twenty years, when the trades meet with banners and music, form a procession, and hold a jubilee at considerable cost to the town. Preston is well provided with schools of all descriptions. About 10,000 Sunday scholars are graciously educated. Preston is a port-- vessels of 150 tons ascending nearly to the town, and the customs duties amounted in 1850 to L. 75,295: 8; 6. Sir Richard Arkwright was born at Preston in 1732; and here, in 1768, he commenced, in connection with a mechanic named John Kay, some of his improvements in the cotton-spinning mechanism. The chief manufacture is cotton, but there is also a good deal of flax-spinning executed here. Two M.P.

It is supposed to be of British origin, and there is reason to conclude that it was a Roman station. It appears to have been first fortified about the time of Agricola; the erection of its castle is attributed to William Rufus. Carlisle was taken by David, King of Scots, and afterwards besieged unsuccessfully by Robert Bruce in 1312. It suffered severely during the civil wars, having declared for Charles I. In 1745, it surrendered to Prince Charles Stuart, and on being retaken by the Duke of Cumberland, was the scene of many cruel severities upon the conquered. After the junction of the kingdoms it sank into decay, but has made great progress since the commencement of the present century. The principal business of the town consists in its manufactures of cotton goods and ginghams, and in a coasting trade. There is a canal from Carlisle to the Solway, and some traffic arises also from its lying on the North Western line of Railway from London to Edinburgh, Glasgow,&amp; c. Before the Reformation, there were several ecclesiastical establishments in the city. It was erected into a see by Henry I. in 1133. Dr Paley was Arch Deacon of Carlisle, and is buried in the cathedral, where a monument has been recently erected to his memory. The cathedral is an ancient building of red freestone, some parts of which are assigned to the Saxon times. It has however suffered much from neglect and the lapse of time, and contains a few monuments of interest. There are numerous other churches in Carlisle, several meeting-houses, a Roman Catholic chapel, a Mechanics' Institute, a theatre, a grammar school founded by Henry Viii. and forty - seven other schools of various kinds. The court-houses were built at an expense of L. 100,000. A considerable portion of the old castle still remains, comprising the keep, a lofty and massive tower, in whihc is a very deep well. The whole has been restored and is a striking feature of the town. Towards the north were the apartments in Mary Queen of Scots was confined on her flight to England, after the battle of Langside.
