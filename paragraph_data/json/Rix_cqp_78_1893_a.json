Keeping down the left bank, therefore, I chose a longer but a prettier route to Ulpha. On the way we pass a set of eighteen stepping-stones-- the fourth set since leaving Cockley Beck. Here the stream again freshens into life, and is very turbulent from this point all the way to Ulpha. The banks, too, are rocky, and often of considerable height, and at one point they form a vista which is somewhat remarkable. The stream takes a sudden and unexpected turn to the right, and, as if by magin, opens up a view down a long straight channel walled in on each side by slabs and pillars of slate. Half way down this corridor, which is known to the natives by the name of Long Dub, is a somewhat noteworthy spot. The forst, or some other of Nature's agents, has here split off a quantity of slate in thin slabs, and these slabs have got themselves jammed together at all sorts of angles, the interstices being filled with luxuriant growth of feathery fern. Here a rill trickles down and falls into the river by a miniature cascade, and just beyond it is a cliff of rock, some twelve or fifteen feet in height, overhanging a deep sullen pool, where the thick foliage of oak and beech casts a black shadow on the waters. This pool, I cannot doubt, is the scene of Wordworth's twenty - second sonnet; there is no other which answers so well to the description. Hither came the poor broken-hearted girl, seeking to solace herself with the beauty of the spring flowers, and here, by some slip of the foot or some failing of the heart or brain, she fell, and the cold waves of Duddon closed over her.","file_id":"1893_a","plnames":[["Ulpha",275,280],["Cockley Beck",366,378],["Ulpha",475,480],["Long Dub",862,870],["Duddon",1761,1767]],"geonouns":[["bridge",20,26],["road",35,39],["stream",62,68],["fields",105,111],["river",176,181],["bank",217,221],["pass",296,300],["stream",389,395],["point",454,459],["banks",486,491],["point",554,559],["stream",612,618],["channel",726,733],["river",1192,1197],["rock",1255,1259],["waters",1401,1407],["foot",1685,1689]],"pos_words":[["right",49,54],["remarkable",596,606],["right",661,666],["noteworthy",886,896],["luxuriant",1112,1121],["well",1523,1527],["solace",1601,1607],["beauty",1625,1631]],"neg_words":[["turbulent",434,443],["rocky",502,507],["unexpected",638,648],["split",957,962],["falls",1177,1182],["sullen",1319,1325],["doubt",1429,1434],["poor",1564,1568],["broken-hearted",1569,1583],["failing",1698,1705],["fell",1733,1737],["cold",1747,1751]],"events":[],"dates":[["the spring",1635,1645]],"times":[["twenty - second",1464,1479]],"distances":[["twelve or fifteen feet",1266,1288]],"loc_advs":[["left",212,216],["here",952,956],["there",1488,1493],["here",1659,1663]],"spa_preps":[["close",138,143],["down",203,207],["into",411,415],["down",705,709],["down",797,801],["together",1045,1053],["down",1168,1172],["into",1183,1187],["beyond",1231,1237],["over",1775,1779]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0251572327,"vader_sentiment":0.91,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974888563},{"para_id":40,"paragraph":"\" Upon the steep rock's breast The lonely primrose yet renews its bloom, Untouched memento of her hapless doom!\"","file_id":"1893_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["rock",17,21]],"pos_words":[["bloom",66,71]],"neg_words":[["steep",11,16],["lonely",35,41],["hapless",98,105],["doom",106,110]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.1875,"vader_sentiment":-0.64,"roberta_sentiment":0.9905551076},{"para_id":41,"paragraph":"There is but one other spot worthy of note before we come to Ulpha, and that is the ancient burial-place at New Close.
