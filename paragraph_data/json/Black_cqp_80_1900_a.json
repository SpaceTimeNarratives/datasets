It overlooks the Lake,-- distant about \u00be of a mile,-- and is 1 \u00bd miles north of Bowness, the chief port of Windermere Lake; so far Bowness is the nearest point on the lake accessible by road, the route to Millerground Landing( \u00be m., see map) being a footpath. The village has a population of nearly 2000, steadily increasing. It consists of several streets, all descending from the railway station, and a large number of gentlemen's residences and detached villas. The great feature of the place, it is needless to say, is Lake Windermere, which extends 10 \u00bd miles in length, and 1 mile in breadth at the widest part. Its principal feeder is formed by the confluence of the Brathay and Rothay shortly before entering the lake. The streams from Troutbeck, Blelham Tarn, and Esthwaite Water also pour in their waters at different points. Numerous islands, varying considerably in size, diversify its surface at no great distance from one another-- none of them being more than 1 \u00bd miles from the central part of the lake. By far the largest is Belle Isle( otherwise\" Curwen Isle\" or\" Long Holm\"), a private park belonging to the Curwen family, and adorned with a mansion familiarly known as the\" Tea Caddy.\" This island, like all the rest, is charmingly wooded, and is a most effective contributor to the beauty of the scene between Bowness and the Ferry. Windermere is deeper than any of the other lakes, except Wastwater, its greatest depth being 219 feet, and its mean depth, in respect of which it ranks below Crummock and Ullswater as well as Wastwater, 78 \u00bd feet. It is plentifully stocked with perch, pike, trout, and char, which last, at the proper season, are potted in large quantities and forwarded to the south. An Angling Association has lately much improved the fishing by removing nearly all the nets, except for char, and destroying to some extent the pike. It is a remarkable fact, that at the spawning season, when the trout and char leave the lake, the former fish takes the Rothay and the latter the Brathay.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Windermere",15,25],["Kendal",89,95],["Lake District",168,181],["Bowness",263,270],["Windermere Lake",290,305],["Bowness",314,321],["Lake Windermere",706,721],["Brathay",857,864],["Rothay",869,875],["Troutbeck",927,936],["Blelham",938,945],["Esthwaite Water",956,971],["Belle Isle",1225,1235],["Isle",1255,1259],["Holm",1270,1274],["Bowness",1514,1521],["Ferry",1530,1535],["Windermere",1537,1547],["Wastwater",1594,1603],["Crummock",1695,1703],["Ullswater",1708,1717],["Wastwater",1729,1738],["Rothay",2175,2181],["Brathay",2201,2208]],"geonouns":[["village",4,11],["station",42,49],["line",64,68],["point",108,113],["port",282,286],["point",337,342],["lake",350,354],["road",369,373],["village",447,454],["streets",532,539],["railway",565,572],["station",573,580],["residences",616,626],["lake",904,908],["streams",914,921],["waters",991,997],["points",1011,1017],["islands",1028,1035],["lake",1197,1201],["park",1288,1292],["mansion",1344,1351],["island",1394,1400],["lakes",1580,1585],["pike",1789,1793],["pike",2049,2053],["lake",2143,2147]],"pos_words":[["accessible",355,365],["great",652,657],["great",1095,1100],["like",1402,1406],["charmingly",1424,1434],["effective",1457,1466],["beauty",1486,1492],["greatest",1609,1617],["respect",1663,1670],["well",1721,1725],["proper",1831,1837],["improved",1944,1952],["remarkable",2063,2073]],"neg_words":[["needless",686,694]],"events":[],"dates":[["nearly 2000",475,486],["the\"",1372,1376],["season",1838,1844],["the spawning season",2088,2107]],"times":[],"distances":[["1 \u00bd miles",244,253],["10 \u00bd miles",737,747],["1 mile",763,769],["1 \u00bd miles",1158,1167],["219 feet",1630,1638],["78 \u00bd feet",1740,1749]],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["about",216,221],["between",1506,1513],["below",1689,1694]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0542986425,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986708164},{"para_id":84,"paragraph":"See Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes, by Hugh Robert Mill, B.

It is built of the dark-grey stone of the district, but the spire-- distressingly heavy and out of harmony with the natural surroundings-- is of freestone. The interior is handsome, and is seated for about 1000.

Its principal thoroughfares are Main Street, St. John's Street, Station Road, Lake Road, Penrith Road and Southey Street. Many additional ones have lately been laid out, and a splendid recreation ground, Fitz Park, has been acquired for the town through the generosity of the Hewetson family, and greatly through the personal exertions of the late H.I. Jenkinson, to whom the fine entrance gates in Station Road are a memorial. It occupies the ground between the river and the railway on both sides of Station Road, covering an area of 36246 acres. The Hewetsons not only gave the land, but also endowed the Mary Hewetson Cottage Hospital, which stands on the site of the Old Monks' Hall at the extreme west end of the ground, facing the back of Greta Hall. The eastern portion of the Park between the Keswick Hotel and the river is laid out as a garden, planted with shrubs, and affording facilities for tennis and bowls; while the western part is devoted to the more robust sports of golf( 9 holes), football, cricket, etc. Opposite the\" Jenkinson\" gate is the Museum, erected as a memorial of Mr. J. Fisher Crosthwaite, a highly esteemed public benefactor. It contains an excellent model of the Lake District( Flintoft's). Keswick has long been famous for its black-lead pencils. The mine from which the plumbago( black lead) used to be obtained is situated at Seathwaite in Borrowdale, but it has long been closed. The manufactories( admission free) are on either side of the street on the town side of Greta Bridge. The Town Hall, erected in 1813, upon the site of the old Court House, stands in the centre of the town. The clock bell, which was taken from a building that formerly stood on Lord's Island in the lake, bears the letters and figures\" H. D. R. 1001,\" which may be regarded rather as the founder's number than as proof of antiquity. The Parish Church, an ancient structure dedicated to St. Kentigern, stands \u00be of a mile distant, on a slight acclivity to the right of the Portinscale road. It contains a recumbent marble statue of the poet Southey( d. 1843), with an inscription by Wordsworth; also statues of Lord and Lady Derwentwater. In the churchyard the ashes of the poet, his first wife, his eldest son, and of other members of his family repose. Greta Hall, the residence of s. T. Coleridge at the beginning of the century, and of Southey from 1805 till 1843, occupies a knoll some way to the right of the road at Greta Bridge, and on the way to Crosthwaite Church and Portinscale.

The honour and castle of Cockermouth belong to Lord Leconfield. The ruins of this ancient fortress, formerly a place of great strength, are seated on a bold eminence which rises from the east bank of the Cocker. It was built soon after the Norman Conquest by Waldieve, first lord of Allerdale, of whose successors it was for many years the baronial seat. In 1648 it was garrisoned for King Charles, but being taken afterwards by the Parliamentarians, was dismantled by them, and has ever since lain in ruins, except a small part at present occupied by Lord Leconfield. The Gateway Tower, embellished with the arms of the Umfravilles, Multons, Lucies, Percies, and Nevilles, is a striking object. On the north side of the town is a tumulus, called Toots Hill; one mile to the west are the remains of a rampart and ditch of an encampment, 750 feet in circuit, called Fitt's Wood.

A flask of spirits is also, in the event of unlooked-for delay, a most desirable accompaniment.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Lake District",21,34],["Scafell",80,87],["Pike",88,92],["Helvellyn",94,103],["Skiddaw",105,112],["Coniston",114,122],["Old Man",123,130],["Langdale Pikes",140,154]],"geonouns":[["mountains",4,13],["hotels",204,210],["summits",507,514],["mountains",518,527],["valley",609,615],["mountain",728,736],["top",737,740],["hills",816,821],["field",982,987],["mountain",1066,1074]],"pos_words":[["best",35,39],["clear",332,337],["well",397,401],["advantage",410,419],["beautiful",564,573],["finer",663,668],["clears",750,756],["agreeable",849,858],["sensations",859,869],["led",897,900],["useful",964,970],["clear",1009,1014],["accurate",1029,1037],["desirable",1314,1323]],"neg_words":[["unusually",55,64],["creeping",532,540],["lowly",603,608],["mist",702,706],["delay",1300,1305]],"events":[],"dates":[["days",338,342]],"times":[["hours",1106,1111]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",646,651]],"spa_preps":[["along",541,546]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0810810811,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9985675812},{"para_id":568,"paragraph":"The description of the mountains is in alphabetical order as follows:--","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["mountains",23,32]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9935130477},{"para_id":569,"paragraph":"Coniston Old Man.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Coniston",0,8],["Old Man",9,16]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9917500615},{"para_id":570,"paragraph":"Helvellyn.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Helvellyn",0,9]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9899356961},{"para_id":571,"paragraph":"Langdale Pikes.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Langdale Pikes",0,14]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9961744547},{"para_id":572,"paragraph":"Scafell Pike.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Scafell",0,7],["Pike",8,12]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9871544838},{"para_id":573,"paragraph":"Skiddaw.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",0,7]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9951508045},{"para_id":574,"paragraph":"Coniston Old Man stands at the north-west angle of Coniston Lake, from the eastern shore of which it presents a magnificent appearance.

The more westerly is termed Pike o' Stickle, and is lower by 78 feet than Harrison Stickle, which is 2401 feet in height. They are of a porphyritic structure, and, on account of their steepness, require more care than ordinary mountains in ascending. ( A guide may be had at either of the hotels below.) They are conspicuous objects from the upper end of Windermere, and from almost all the southern half of the Lake District; indeed, as far south as Lancaster and Morecambe. They are usually ascended from Langdale, but pedestrians would have no difficulty in making the ascent from the Stake, or from Grasmere through Easedale. The easiest mode, however, is that from Langdale. From either of the hotels take the path to Dungeon Gill( p. 39). This path continues to ascend steeply from the waterfall, keeping the beck on the right hand, and then doubling under a rocky point above. The next part is a more gradual climb over rank grass to the foot of the final steep pitch. Then, keeping the beck that descends between the two pikes a good way off on the right, you will climb somewhat abruptly to a point from which the ascent of either is quite simple. Though of considerably inferior elevation to the other mountains we have described, the views from either of the Pikes are extremely fine. Looking eastward, Helvellyn, Seat Sandal, and Fairfield bound the prospect, and in the north-west and north Skiddaw and Saddleback are seen in the distance. From Harrison Stickle, Stickle Tarn is immediately below the eye, guarded by the frowning heights of Pavey Ark. In the south-east are the hills around the valleys of Ambleside, and beyond, those at the head of Troutbeck and Kentmere. In turning to the south, the eye is attracted by the valley of the Great Langdale, containing Elterwater and Loughrigg Tarn, and terminated by the upper part of Windermere, far away beyond which rise the Yorkshire Fells. Loughrigg Fell conceals a portion of the head of the lake, as well as the town of Ambleside. Underbarrow Scar, near Kendal, is seen over Bowness. Esthwaite Water appears in the south-south-east, and close at hand, towards the right, is the bluff summit of Wetherlam. A small part of the sea is embraced in the view in this direction. Through an opening, having on the left Pike o' Blisco, and on the right Crinkle Crags, Black Combe is presented in the south-west.

The mountains, having lost the shapes they possessed when viewed from beneath, are only to be recognised by those acquainted with the locality of each; however, with the aid of his compass, map, and our directions, the inquiring gazer will be able to assign their names to most of them. Turning to the south, Morecambe Bay and the Lancashire coast to a great extent are seen, and on very clear days the prospect comprehends a portion of North Wales. Scafell intercepts the view of one side of Wastwater and the Screes. To the south the upper end of Eskdale is seen backed by the rocky summit of Harter Fell, between which and Scafell itself the prospect takes in the Duddon estuary, Black Combe, and Devoke Water. Beyond the estuary appear the chimneys of Barrow and Walney. Still more to the east, Bowfell, Wetherlam, Coniston Old Man, with the rest of the mountains at the head of Eskdale, Seathwaite, and Little Langdale, are conspicuous. Bowfell obscures Langdale, but the upper part of Windermere, with the Low Wood Hotel, is seen between it and Crinkle Crags. Far away, beyond, are the Yorkshire hills, with Ingleborough, the monarch of them all, plainly visible. To the left of Bowfell, Langdale Pikes are descried, and in the east the eye rests upon Wansfell, Red Screes, High Street, Fairfield, Seat Sandal, and Helvellyn in succession. In the north Skiddaw and Saddleback cannot be mistaken, beyond which the blue mountains of Scotland bound the prospect. Almost beneath his eyes, the spectator will perceive Sty Head Tarn dwindled to a little spot. Great End rises on the right of it and Great Gable on the left, while beyond appear a portion of Borrowdale, Castle Crag, and Derwentwater, part of which is hidden by the Catbells range. In the north are a series of hills, the principal of which are-- Dale Head, Causey Pike, Grisedale Pike, Maiden Moor, Hindscarth, and Robinson. Then come the Buttermere and Crummock mountains, with Grasmoor conspicuously visible. Nearer are the Pillar, Hay Cock, High Stile, and the Wasdale Red Pike; and still nearer Kirkfell, Yewbarrow, Seatallan, and Buckbarrow sink to the dale and lake of Wastwater. The Irish Sea bounds the whole western horizon, and over the extremity of the vale of Wastwater the Isle of Man can often be perceived.","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Pikes",18,23],["Morecambe Bay",533,546],["Lancashire",555,565],["North Wales",661,672],["Scafell",674,681],["Wastwater",717,726],["Screes",735,741],["Eskdale",773,780],["Harter Fell",819,830],["Scafell",850,857],["Duddon",891,897],["Black Combe",907,918],["Devoke Water",924,936],["Barrow",980,986],["Walney",991,997],["Bowfell",1023,1030],["Wetherlam",1032,1041],["Coniston",1043,1051],["Old Man",1052,1059],["Eskdale",1107,1114],["Seathwaite",1116,1126],["Little Langdale",1132,1147],["Bowfell",1166,1173],["Langdale",1183,1191],["Windermere",1215,1225],["Low Wood",1236,1244],["Crags",1283,1288],["Yorkshire",1316,1325],["Ingleborough",1338,1350],["Bowfell",1409,1416],["Langdale Pikes",1418,1432],["Wansfell",1482,1490],["Screes",1496,1502],["High Street",1504,1515],["Fairfield",1517,1526],["Seat Sandal",1528,1539],["Helvellyn",1545,1554],["Skiddaw",1583,1590],["Saddleback",1595,1605],["Scotland",1661,1669],["Sty Head",1743,1751],["Great End",1784,1793],["Great Gable",1823,1834],["Borrowdale",1881,1891],["Castle Crag",1893,1904],["Derwentwater",1910,1922],["Catbells",1955,1963],["Causey Pike",2047,2058],["Grisedale Pike",2060,2074],["Buttermere",2129,2139],["Crummock",2144,2152],["Grasmoor",2169,2177],["Pillar",2216,2222],["Hay Cock",2224,2232],["High Stile",2234,2244],["Wasdale",2254,2261],["Red Pike",2262,2270],["Kirkfell",2289,2297],["Yewbarrow",2299,2308],["Wastwater",2365,2374],["Irish Sea",2380,2389],["Wastwater",2462,2471],["Isle",2476,2480]],"geonouns":[["hill",115,119],["mountains",228,237],["coast",566,571],["summit",809,815],["estuary",898,905],["estuary",949,956],["mountains",1082,1091],["head",1099,1103],["hills",1326,1331],["mountains",1648,1657],["hills",2000,2005],["mountains",2153,2162],["dale",2348,2352],["lake",2357,2361],["horizon",2415,2422],["vale",2454,2458]],"pos_words":[["tops",120,124],["great",577,582],["clear",612,617],["right",1807,1812]],"neg_words":[["tumultuous",90,100],["waste",101,106],["confused",162,170],["lost",246,250],["rocky",803,808],["conspicuous",1153,1164],["obscures",1174,1182],["mistaken",1616,1624],["conspicuously",2178,2191],["sink",2336,2340]],"events":[],"dates":[["days",618,622]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beneath",294,301],["between",832,839],["between",1260,1267],["away",1294,1298],["left",1401,1405],["left",1842,1846]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",1300,1306],["beyond",1626,1632],["beneath",1697,1704],["beyond",1854,1860],["over",2428,2432]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0254237288,"vader_sentiment":0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9404165745},{"para_id":600,"paragraph":"Skiddaw","file_id":"1900_a","plnames":[["Skiddaw",0,7]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9948977828},{"para_id":601,"paragraph":"3058 feet high.

Nothing can exceed the charming appearance of the valley and town of Keswick, of Derwentwater and its surrounding eminences, when beheld from the mountain's side; the lake especially, with its bays and islands, is nowhere seen to such advantage. The principal objects which are visible from the summit are as follows:\" In the north, beyond the lowlands of Cumberland, in which Carlisle and its cathedral are perceived, the Solway Firth is seen, on the farther side of which the Scottish mountains are displayed in fine arrangement. Criffel is seen over Skiddaw Far Man, and the Moffat and Cheviot hills stretch away to the right. In the east the rival summit of Saddleback( Blencathra) is descried, and far away to the left of it Penrith may be seen reposing in its verdant vale, beyond which the long Pennine range, culminating in the level-topped Crossfell, the highest summit in England outside the Lake District, bounds the prospect. Helvellyn is in the south-east; beyond, Ingleborough in Yorkshire is dimly descried. Between Helvellyn and Saddleback, the High Street range far away beyond Ullswater is visible. When the atmosphere is clear, Lancaster Castle may be seen in the south-east. Derwentwater is not comprehended in the view from the highest Man, being concealed by some of the other eminences of Skiddaw, but from the third Man a perfect bird's - eye prospect of that lake is obtained. In the south there is a succession of five several ranges of mountain seen out-topping each other, from a stripe of the lovely valley to the peak of Scafell Pike. Grisedale in one long line stretches from the enclosures at Braithwaite to its Pike, succeeded in the second range by Barrow, Stile End, and Outerside. Rising from the fields at Newlands, the third range commences with Rowling End, ascending from which are Causey Pike, Scar Crag, Sail, Eel Crag, and Grasmoor-- the last-named lessening the Pike of Grisedale by appearing over its top. The fourth line in this wild combination is composed of Catbells, Maiden Moor, Dale Head, Hindscarth, Robinson, High Crag, High Stile, and Red Pike. The fifth and last is that sublime chain of summits extending on the south from Coniston to Ennerdale on the north; amongst these Scafell Pike and Scafell, towering over the rest, have on the left Great End, Hanging Knott, Bow Fell, and the Fells of Coniston; on the right, Lingmell, Great Gable, Kirk Fell, the Pillar, the Steeple, and the Hay Cock, with Yewbarrow and part of the Screes through the pass at Black Sail. On the right of Grisedale Pike, and beyond Hobcarton Crags and Whiteside, in a clear atmosphere, may be observed more than the northern half of the Isle of Man; and on a mistless sunny evening even Ireland may be seen. The north-west end or foot of Bassenthwaite Water is here seen, the head being obscured by Longside\"( Green). Workington can be seen at the mouth of the Derwent in the west, and more to the north the coast-towns of Maryport and Allonby. The town and castle of Cockermouth are perceived, over the extremity of Bassenthwaite Lake, seated on the Cocker.
