Derwent Coleridge, I called to-day at Rydal Mount. I had great interest in entering again the grounds and the house which six years ago I visited with such eager expectation. Everything remains as it was in the poet's lifetime-- the books and the pictures and the furniture. Wordsworth's chair stands in its accustomed place by the drawing-room fireside. Mrs. Wordsworth seems also unchanged. Her manners are simple and unpretending, but she received me very cordially. As was natural, almost the first inquiries were after Mrs. Henry Reed and her children. She spoke with much feeling of Professor Reed and Miss Bronson, who scarcely a year ago perished in the Arctic. They left Rydal Mount for Liverpool to embark, and it was little more than a week after their parting from this dear venerable lady that the waves closed over them. Mrs. Wordsworth is almost eighty - five, and is as clear in mind as ever. You forget her great age in talking with her. And what tenderness there is in the tones of her voice, and what truthful simplicity in her words! We did not remain very long. I accepted her invitation to drink tea the next evening in company with Mr. Coleridge. As we drove away, we passed the spot where Wordsworth gave me his hand in parting six years ago, and but six months before his death. Later in the day, Mr. Coleridge and I took a walk along the Brathay to Skelwith Force and back, a round of six miles. The valley through which we went was familiar ground to Mr. Coleridge, he and his brother Hartley,--\" My poor brother Hartley!\" as Mr. Coleridge says when he speaks of him,-- having spent five or six years there in their schoolboy days. We went to the cottage where they had lived, and the well-remembered rooms brought up to my friend a crowd of recollections of forty years ago. He talked much of those early days as we walked together along that sweet valley. We reached the Force, which is a pretty waterfall, and returned on the other side of the valley. It rained occasionally, but one gets used to this in England.","file_id":"1899_a","plnames":[["Derwent",56,63],["Rydal Mount",94,105],["Wordsworth",331,341],["Wordsworth",416,426],["Rydal Mount",736,747],["Liverpool",752,761],["Wordsworth",896,906],["Wordsworth",1269,1279],["Brathay",1420,1427],["Skelwith",1431,1439],["England",2091,2098]],"geonouns":[["grounds",150,157],["house",166,171],["valley",1482,1488],["ground",1524,1530],["cottage",1730,1737],["valley",1933,1939],["waterfall",1981,1990],["valley",2030,2036]],"pos_words":[["great",113,118],["eager",212,217],["clear",942,947],["great",980,985],["truthful",1076,1084],["well",1768,1772],["sweet",1927,1932],["pretty",1974,1980]],"neg_words":[["scarcely",682,690],["tenderness",1020,1030],["death",1353,1358],["poor",1583,1587]],"events":[],"dates":[["August 11, 1855",0,15],["to-day",84,90],["six years ago",178,191],["a year ago",691,701],["a week",801,807],["six years ago",1308,1321],["six months",1331,1341],["the day",1369,1376],["five or six years",1666,1683],["their schoolboy days",1693,1713],["forty years ago",1842,1857],["those early days",1877,1893]],"times":[["the next evening",1178,1194],["Later in",1360,1368]],"distances":[["six miles",1467,1476]],"loc_advs":[["left",731,735],["there",1031,1036],["away",1238,1242],["there",1684,1689]],"spa_preps":[["over",880,884],["along",1410,1415],["round",1458,1463],["through",1489,1496],["together",1907,1915],["along",1916,1921]],"normalised_sentiment":0.02,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9948740602},{"para_id":4,"paragraph":"August 12, Sunday.-- I went to the new Ambleside church this morning.

I went by coach from Ambleside, ascending the Kirkstone Pass. I was outside, and could enjoy at first, as I looked back, the sweet morning view of Lake Windermere with its islands and its fair green hillsides. But soon the sharp ascent of the road brought us between steep mountain-declivities, shutting out all view except their desolate grey slopes. There were but scanty patches of grass here and there: all else was stony and barren. I walked in advance of the coach, enjoying the silence and the solitude, and the grand slopes of the naked mountains on either hand. Up and up we went, until at last the summit of the pass is reached. There stands the old stone house said to be the highest inhabited house in England-- a rude enough dwelling, and at present an alehouse. Beginning now our descent toward Patterdale, we had from the summit of the pass a view of the little lake of Brotherswater, and soon our road was along the margin of this fair high-lying tarn. The mountains stand quite around the lake, leaving only space for the road. From the foot of the pass a drive of a few miles brought us to Patterdale, and there my coach-journey ended. I climbed to a stone-quarry on the hillside opposite, and thence had a view of the valley through which I had just passed, and of the lake of Ullswater stretching off to the right. Returning to the inn at Patterdale, I engaged a boat to take me to Lyulph's Tower, distant five or six miles. A young man with drawing-materials and pack slung over his shoulder was about to leave the inn. I asked him to take a seat with me, and we were soon side by side in the open boat on the beautiful lake. From the level of the water the mountains rising on either hand appeared in their full dignity. The lake is quite shut in by these steep and lofty hills. For a while the clouds where threatening, but we dreaded wind more than rain, for these lakes are often lashed by sudden storms.

We asked for luncheon, but in the principal room, to which we were shown, two travelling tailors were at work. It seemed pleasanter to be in the open air, so we had our table under the trees outside. My companion proved to be a clergyman: he was fresh from Oxford, and had just taken orders. We had fallen at once into intimacy, but we had immediately to part company. My way was onward to Keswick, a walk of eleven miles. I ascended first a long hill, and then my route wound along or around the side of a mountain. Above and below me was bare heath or mountain-moor: there were no trees whatever. For near two hours I saw no house or sign of cultivation, nor did I meet a human being. The wind blew strongly in my face, but my blood coursed through all my veins, and I had ever before me a wide sweeping view. I descended at length into the fair valley through which the Greta flows, and about two hours more of steady walking brought me to Keswick. My stopping-place, however, was at the inn at Portinscale on the banks of Derwentwater, a mile out of Keswick, where I had agreed to meet Mr. Coleridge. I dined, and was resting after my long walk, when I heard his voice in the hall inquiring for me. With him were three other gentlemen, one of them the friend with whom he was staying, who asked me to return with them and drink tea at his house. One of the four was Dr. Carlyle, a brother of the Chelsea philosopher, himself a man of letters, the prose translator of Dante. I soon found myself in a pretty drawing-room looking out on Derwentwater. Mr. Leitch was our host. We had a great deal of animated talk at the tea-table, and later in the long twilight Mr. Coleridge read to us the\" Ancient Mariner\" and\" Genevieve,\" his father's matchless poems. He reads extremely well.

Here our real work was to begin. We climbed to the top of the hill down which the stream falls over rocks piled upon rocks, forming a succession of cascades. It was a ladder-like ascent of no little difficulty. After admiring the view of the rocky chasm and the falls, we turned to enjoy the prospect which opened before us from Ladderbrow, as it is called. Derwentwater lay stretched before us, and Skiddaw rose in its giant majesty in the distance. The view is a celebrated one. We then entered the wood, crossed a beck or small stream, losing our way once, and at length reached an upland valley-- Watendlath-- very retired and secluded, with its small hamlet, and near by a tarn--\" A little lake, and yet uplifted high among the mountains.\" The day was cloudy, but there was not much mist. Climbing another ridge, we found ourselves looking down upon Borrowdale and the little village of Rosthwaite, one of the loveliest views I ever beheld. Sunlight was upon the vale while we stood in the shadow. We were looking up Borrowdale to the Sty Head Pass. As we descended into the valley we could enjoy the view of it every step of the way. At Rosthwaite we had luncheon. It was half past three. We had still a mountain to climb; and as there was something of danger, for we might lose our way should the mist increase, we took a guide, a man well known to Mr. Coleridge-- one of the dalesmen of Borrowdale. We started at a vigorous pace, and, following the course of a stony brook, ascended the steep mountain-side. It was very sharp work, for it was an absolutely continuous ascent, and there was no pathway whatever. There was no sign of human habitation. On either hand were only the stony mountain slopes. It seemed a long and weary way, but at the end of two hours of steady climbing we reached the summit. A cold mist here enveloped us. We hastened on, our guide accompanying us a short distance over the moor as we began our descent: he saw us clear of the mist and safely on our way. When we had reached an eminence from which we could look down into Far Easdale, our route was clear to us, and we turned and waved our adieus to our friendly guide. We were already a long way off from him, and he was resting where we had left him, waiting to see that we took the right course. Descending rapidly, we went on and on through the desolate and lonely valley of Far Easdale-- a vale within a vale, for it opens into Easdale.

Here we here a car for Strand's near Wast Water, a distance of seven or eight miles. We stopped, however, a mile from Ravenglass, at Muncaster Castle,\" the seat of the ancient family of the Penningtons.\" The guidebooks say that Henry Vi. was entertained here on his flight after the battle of Hexham, and that when he left Muncaster he gave to Sir John Pennington an enamelled glass vase. The glass has been carefully preserved in the castle, the tradition being that the family would never want a male heir while it remained unbroken. We drove through the park by a winding road, which brought us to the castle. The chief thing here is what is known as the terrace, cut on a hillside, and commanding a view which is said to be the finest in Cumberland. All around are noble trees and beautiful shrubbery and gay flowers, so that one could hardly think the great sea so near.

It had been the chief object of my pilgrimage-- the sight of this schoolhouse. Coniston was my further destination. A coach was standing at the door of an inn, which I found was just starting for this place, so I climbed to an outside seat, and found as my sole companion a good-natured man who at once entered into talk with me. He seemed a well-to-do man, and as he told me soon whence he had come and whither he was going, I naturally imparted to him what had been the object of my pilgrimage to Hawkshead. He seemed to find it hard to account to himself for my enthusiasm; still, the only inquiry he made of me in endeavouring to enlighten himself was a singular one. \" Was he a rich man?\" he asked me, referring to Wordsworth.

He said Emerson dined with him some months ago when at Durham; that he spoke of having seen a good deal of Carlyle when in London; that he, Carlyle, was out of health and depressed. The loss of his wife preyed on him; he was unable to sleep, and the chief comfort he found in his sleepless hours was in saying over and over again the Lord's Prayer. Emerson's daughter was travelling with him, but being unwell, she could not go to dine at the dean's. At the table something from Keble was quoted, but neither Emerson nor the dean could get it right. \" Oh, I'll ask my daughter,\" said Emerson.

Miss Arnold said it was not pleasant to her to hear this adverse criticism--\" But you know one cannot tell a lady of great age, though a trumpet, that you utterly object to what she is saying.\" The dean spoke of Professor Jowett with admiration, though he could not wholly agree with him. Of Maurice the dean spoke with great respect; he said Hutton, the editor of the Spectator, was the chief representative of his opinions. Mr. Forster, too, might be mentioned as a leading man on whom the teaching of Maurice had had a strong influence.

The Misses Quillinan, as being the step-daughters of Dora Quillinan, are the nearest, and indeed the only, representatives of Wordsworth remaining here in the neighbourhood of Rydal Mount.","file_id":"1899_a","plnames":[["Wordsworth",90,100],["Wordsworth",206,216],["India",260,265],["Cockermouth.",373,385],["Wishing Gate",418,430],["Wordsworth",704,714],["Rydal Mount",754,765]],"geonouns":[["head",290,294],["gate",459,463],["gate",514,518]],"pos_words":[["pleasant",113,121]],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["twelve years",322,334]],"times":[["Late in the afternoon",0,21]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["past",146,150],["home",250,254],["here",725,729]],"spa_preps":[["over",137,141]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0151515152,"vader_sentiment":0.82,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986129999},{"para_id":85,"paragraph":"July 7. -- I left Ambleside to-day for Keswick. I was on the outside of the coach, and had a full view of the slopes of the hills, the green of the pastures, fretted here and there by crags; I saw the sweet lakes once more, Rydal and Grasmere, and farther on there were numerous flocks of sheep coming down the mountains, probably for the shearing. Dogs were guiding them and keeping them together with wonderful and unerring instinct. And then we passed Thirlmere, which is the highest of the English lakes. Here the view had become wild and desolate, the hillsides bare and rocky. We descended from this high valley into a fair smiling country once more. The coach stopped at the entrance to St. John's Vale, and I determined to talk to Keswick by that route. It is a narrow, winding valley, shut in by deep hills, with a stream flowing through it. On either side of the water there is thick wood, but with open spaces here and there, and farmhouses. The rocks which overhang the vale at about centre have the look of a fortress. I entered the vale of the Greta, and then descended the long Saddelback, and made my way at length to the Portinscale Hotel; there I rested after my three hours' walk, and in the evening went on by rail to the neighbourhood of Cockermouth, where I was to spend a few days at the house of some friends.","file_id":"1899_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",18,27],["Keswick",39,46],["Rydal",224,229],["Grasmere",234,242],["Thirlmere",455,464],["St. John's Vale",694,709],["Keswick",739,746],["Greta",1058,1063],["Portinscale",1138,1149],["Cockermouth",1259,1270]],"geonouns":[["coach",76,81],["slopes",110,116],["hills",124,129],["crags",184,189],["lakes",207,212],["mountains",311,320],["lakes",502,507],["valley",611,617],["country",638,645],["coach",661,666],["entrance",682,690],["winding",778,785],["valley",786,792],["hills",810,815],["stream",824,830],["water",873,878],["wood",894,898],["rocks",957,962],["vale",982,986],["vale",1046,1050],["house",1311,1316]],"pos_words":[["sweet",201,206],["wonderful",403,412],["fair",625,629],["smiling",630,637]],"neg_words":[["wild",534,538],["desolate",543,551],["rocky",576,581],["rail",1230,1234]],"events":[],"dates":[["July 7",0,6],["to-day",28,34],["a few days",1293,1303]],"times":[["three hours",1181,1192],["the evening",1207,1218]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",13,17],["outside",61,68],["here",166,170],["there",175,180],["there",259,264],["there",879,884],["here",921,925],["there",930,935],["there",1157,1162]],"spa_preps":[["down",302,306],["together",389,397],["into",618,622],["through",839,846],["about",990,995]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986184835},{"para_id":86,"paragraph":"Of this visit I need make but little record.
