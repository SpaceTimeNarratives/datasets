An idea slightly similar to this seems at one period to have germinated in Professor Wilson's brain; but, notwithstanding the fertility of the soil, it bore no fruit. In a review of Green's Guide, the Professor says,--\" It is our serious intention to pitch our Tent, next summer, somewhere or other among these said Lakes. Each of our principal contributors will have a Lake assigned him, and the lesser ones a Tarn. Wastle shall have Windermere-- Odoherty, Ullswater-- Ourselves, Keswick-- and Kempferhausen is perfectly welcome to Conistone. By a just distribution of our forces, the Lakes will find themselves looked at and described in a way they never experienced before.\" As nearly thirty years have elapsed since this intention was promulgated, and we have still to deplore its non-fulfillment, I have taken the initiative with the Lake somewhat depreciatingly assigned to the German savan. It is devoutly to be wished that my modest example were followed with regard to the other great Lakes, by parties who know them as perfectly as I know Conistone. It may hardly be gainsaid that there are such about every one of our Lakes, able, were they willing, to do much more justice to their subjects than poor Conistone has obtained from me; and if they would only set about it, I might, at least, claim the credit of having opened the ball.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Lakes",862,867],["Conistone",1079,1088],["Lakes",1132,1137],["German",1430,1436],["Lakes",1540,1545],["Conistone",1595,1604],["Lakes",1675,1680],["Conistone",1759,1768]],"geonouns":[["country",115,122],["residence",330,339],["district",374,382],["forces",1120,1126]],"pos_words":[["work",259,263],["intimate",348,356],["secure",399,405],["comprehensive",471,484],["useful",491,497],["amusing",508,515],["perfectly",1058,1067],["welcome",1068,1075],["fulfillment",1335,1346],["modest",1480,1486],["regard",1514,1520],["great",1534,1539],["perfectly",1575,1584],["willing",1698,1705]],"neg_words":[["bore",698,702],["deplore",1319,1326],["poor",1754,1758]],"events":[],"dates":[["next summer",813,824],["nearly thirty years",1227,1246]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["somewhere",826,835],["there",1637,1642]],"spa_preps":[["among",845,850],["about",1652,1657],["about",1818,1823]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0683229814,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9930064678},{"para_id":5,"paragraph":"In the volume now offered to his favourable consideration, the reader will find a very sufficient guide to all that is worthy of notice in the neighbourhood it depicts.

I may state, however, that these duties and cares arise chiefly from an occupation which, more than any other, affords facilities of observing the topographical peculiarities of a district of country, and of noting the characteristics, social and psychological, of its inhabitants of every class. On this latter department of my subject, I should have dilated more freely, had I not been restrained by two salutary considerations, the first being a wish to keep within compass, and avoid prolixity-- the second, a desire to live in peace and good-will with those amongst whom my lot in life is cast.

It is about six and a half miles long, therefore ranks next after Windermere and Ullswater in point of size, or, to speak very exactly, in point of longitude, for I should suppose the area of Bassenthwaite Water to be larger than the area of this lake, it( Bassenthwaite), though only four miles long, carrying a better breadth with it than Conistone Water, whose greatest width does not exceed a mile, many parts not half a mile, the average lying, perhaps, between them. Its greatest depth is stated in the Guide Books to be twenty - seven fathoms, but a map or chart of the lake in my possession, which was made from actual survey, many years ago, by a talented native of the dale, gives the depth of forty fathoms at about two - thirds of the distance down the lake, and twenty or thirty yards from the western shore. This places the depth of Conistone Lake second only to that of Wastwater, which is stated by some to be forty - five fathoms, by others to be unfathomable. Conistone Lake contains, in addition to some mere rocks, two islands. The uppermost, called Knott's Island, after its proprietor, or more frequently, Fir Island, from its handsome covering of Scotch firs, becomes peninsular in very droughty weather; and the lower, called Peel Island-- why, I do n't know-- or Montagu Island, after the Dukes of Montagu, formerly Lords of the Manor, and succeeded by the Dukes of Buccleugh, or by the Aborigines, the\" Gridiron,\" the best name of the three, inasmuch as it pretty accurately describes its shape, it having a handle or shank of rocks projected in lengthened chain from its south-western side, is covered by natural wood of no great altitude; and its rocky sides are so high and precipitous, as to render landing upon it a matter of difficulty, if not of danger, but, for all that, pic-nic parties sometimes resort to it. There was also a floating island about twenty yards square, finely covered with young birches of decent stature, which used to move about the lower end of the lake, but unfortunately it was stranded amongst the reeds near Nibthwaite by a strong north-east wind which prevailed for a day or two in October, 1846, when the lake was unusually swollen by heavy rains.

The placid lake and its winding shores you are now staring at, and tastefully, as you perceive, are its winding shores decorated with timber disposed in rich variety of thriving young plantations, clump, grove, coppice, hedge-row, solitary tree, avenue, and shrubbery, gracefully interblended here, and separated by fields and wide pastures of glorious verdure there, the whole finished off on the east, which we shall dispose of first, by miles and miles of heath purpled moorland. Along the lake on its said eastern side, are the finely-sheltered grounds of Tent Lodge, Bank Ground, Conistone Bank, Brantwood, and Water Park. The lake appears to terminate at about five miles distance-- in fact, a little below the\" Gridiron,\" or a mile and a half from the lake foot-- the water thereabout making a gentle sweep to the east. The southward prospect is bounded by the high-lying moor of Gawthwaite, from whence the green and cultivated slopes of Lowick and Blawith appear to descend in easy gradation to the water edge. Bringing the eye back along the western shore, your attention is next arrested by the brightly verdant, cultivated and conical height of Stable Harvey, standing out in fine contrast against the dark brown Beacon hill in Blawith, which considerably overtops it, and forms, with its broken outline, a highly picturesque background to the landscape in that direction. The landward edge of Stable Harvey is hidden from where you are, by the lengthened heath-clad summit, and coppiced and furze-clad side of Torver common, which rises steep from the margin of the lake to a considerable height. As you follow up the margin of the lake, you next descry the beautiful farm of Hawthwaite, with its rookery, plantations, and numerous single trees, occupying a fine situation under the northern shoulder of Torver common, and presenting one of the most eligible sites for a gentleman's seat, with extensive grounds, in the north of England. Nearer still, you see a promontory covered with bright verdure, and tipped, or fringed, with low spreading wood, running out, as it seems from the Water Head, into the very middle of the lake. It is the Hall Point; the grounds lying between it and Hawthwaite, and extending from the water side to the tops of the heights more than a mile to the westward, form the ancient deer-park, which possesses such a luxuriant and widely-extended covering of natural timber, as might gladden the hearts of those who affect to hold that any utilitarian interference with nature tends grievously to degrade or destroy the romantic characteristics of lake scenery.

Its scattered appearance suggests the idea of something having, at some former period, flown across the country with a bagful of houses, and losing a number here in irregular lots through a hole in the sack. And here, close by in the apex, or, to speak nautically, the bight of the bay, between a row of lofty sycamores and the wide-spread woods of the old park, stands Conistone Hall, the ancient seat of the once warlike family of le Fleming, but now a farm house-- with a considerable portion removed, and the banquet hall, wherein, of old, knightly revellers befuddled their brains in honour of high born ladies, converted into a barn, and a mighty commodious barn it makes; but how very applicable would be a quotation from Hamlet here, were it not hackneyed.

As you leave it by a steep acclivity, you had better take a survey of Little Langdale which lies spread out at your feet. Rather further than midway between you and the abruptly rising range of hill called Lingmoor, which divides this vale from its larger namesake, lies Langdale Tarn, which bears out the Poet Laureate's assertion, that\" Tarns are often surrounded by an unsightly tract of boggy ground.\" The chief beauty of Little Langdale consists in the irregular hillocky nature of its ground and the sites of its dwellings, many of which nestle so cosily in little dells, behind rocky knolls, and beneath umbrageous trees, as to convey a notion of the most attractive smugness; but here I am heretic enough to dispute the infallibility of the Poet Laureate's taste. He has declared war against whitewash in something like the following terns:-- The\" objections to white, as a colour, in large spots or masses in landscapes, especially in a mountaineous country, are insurmountable\"-- and, quoting somebody who says\" that white destroys the grada - tions of distance,\" he holds on thus--\" Fife or six white houses! scattered over a valley, by their obtrusiveness, dot the surface, and divide it into triangles, or other mathematical figures, haunting the eye, and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect.\" By the bye, a fair lady, whose opinion, in most matters of taste, I hold in the deepest reverence, recently became a convert to this doctrine of Mr Wordsworth, because she noticed the effect just instanced, not when gazing upon a landscape, but when compiling patch work in which fragments of white intruded amongst the blues, yellows, greens, reds, and neutrals, woefully disturbed the harmony and repose of the cushion cover or quilt. Mr Wordsworth says also, in support of his anti-whitewashing theory, that\" in nature, pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects, such as flowers; or in those which are transitory, as the clouds, foam on rivers, and snow.\" But I must remind those who take for gospel every word that Mr Wordsworth preaches, that the\" White Cliffs of England,\" the snows upon a thousand hills, and the foam of a thousand cataracts are neither minute nor transitory; and that large masses of white in nature, such as these, as well as white clouds, and the terrible white of a stormy sea upon a rocky coast are all calculated to excite sensations the sublime and beautiful in any bosom, whether the possessor be very much of a man of feeling and imagination or the reverse. But coming back to cottages, with all due deference to the Poet Laureate's argument, and with more to that of his fair and talented supporter, I do maintain that no objects can give such a gratifying air of life and cheerfulness to a valley surrounded, or not, by high mountains, or so strikingly enhance the bright green of herbage and foliage, or the more sombre, but warmer, tints of near or distant hills, as a liberal sprinkling over the landscape of pure white cottages, embosomed, as these are, each in its own nest of sheltering trees; and I do wish that the farmers of Langdale, and all our other fell-dales, would expend a shilling or two annually on lime, and bestow upon their romantically situated homesteads,\" the cleanly, pleasant appearance derivable from a plentiful periodical application of white-wash.\" Their present grim, dingy, almost squalid exteriors, are strongly suggestive to the mind of a stranger of internal poverty, desolation and dirt, than which nothing can be more distant from their real in-door condition; for, in all these scattered houses, miserable as they look externally, there is abundance for the wants of the inmates and for the requirements of hospitality, and their cleanliness is such that, as I have partaken of many meals spread upon their unclothed tables, so, in the absence of a table, would I not scruple to eat my dinner if laid upon any of their blue flagged floors, for those are cleaner than many table-cloths I have seen in the course of my peregrinations through other countries.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Little Langdale",433,448],["Langdale",634,642],["Little Langdale",789,804],["Wordsworth",1838,1848],["Wordsworth",2130,2140],["Wordsworth",2425,2435],["England",2472,2479],["Langdale",3472,3480]],"geonouns":[["hamlet",158,164],["feet",479,483],["hill",557,561],["vale",598,602],["ground",760,766],["ground",854,860],["dells",934,939],["trees",985,990],["landscapes",1281,1291],["country",1322,1329],["houses",1475,1481],["valley",1500,1506],["landscape",1920,1929],["rivers",2343,2349],["hills",2508,2513],["cataracts",2542,2551],["sea",2704,2707],["coast",2721,2726],["cottages",2913,2921],["valley",3128,3134],["mountains",3163,3172],["hills",3297,3302],["landscape",3337,3346],["cottages",3361,3369],["trees",3431,3436],["dales",3505,3510],["door",3920,3924],["houses",3964,3970],["tables",4193,4199],["table",4225,4230],["table",4348,4353],["countries",4422,4431]],"pos_words":[["famous",80,86],["better",409,415],["beauty",779,785],["attractive",1026,1036],["enough",1069,1075],["infallibility",1091,1104],["like",1186,1190],["perfect",1680,1687],["fair",1704,1708],["reverence",1778,1787],["work",1956,1960],["harmony",2077,2084],["support",2155,2162],["pure",2213,2217],["well",2647,2651],["excite",2749,2755],["sensations",2756,2766],["sublime",2771,2778],["beautiful",2783,2792],["deference",2936,2945],["fair",3008,3012],["talented",3017,3025],["supporter",3026,3035],["gratifying",3083,3093],["strikingly",3180,3190],["enhance",3191,3198],["bright",3203,3209],["warmer",3264,3270],["pure",3350,3354],["romantically",3583,3595],["cleanly",3622,3629],["pleasant",3631,3639],["plentiful",3668,3677],["abundance",4016,4025],["cleanliness",4106,4117],["cleaner",4330,4337]],"neg_words":[["asinine",87,94],["uncomfortable",254,267],["steep",384,389],["lies",455,459],["abruptly",532,540],["lies",629,633],["irregular",821,830],["rocky",948,953],["heretic",1061,1068],["dispute",1079,1086],["objections",1219,1229],["haunting",1610,1618],["disturbing",1632,1642],["woefully",2054,2062],["disturbed",2063,2072],["scarcely",2227,2235],["terrible",2677,2685],["stormy",2697,2703],["rocky",2715,2720],["fell",3500,3504],["grim",3731,3735],["stranger",3811,3819],["poverty",3832,3839],["desolation",3841,3851],["dirt",3856,3860],["miserable",3972,3981],["absence",4212,4219]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",309,313],["about three months in the year",331,361],["the\"",2451,2455],["annually",3543,3551]],"times":[["minute",2564,2570]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",512,519],["here",1051,1055],["near",3281,3285],["there",4007,4012]],"spa_preps":[["over",13,17],["over",48,52],["out",467,470],["out",661,664],["behind",941,947],["beneath",966,973],["against",1155,1162],["over",1493,1497],["into",1563,1567],["amongst",1998,2005],["over",3328,3332],["through",4408,4415]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0222222222,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9986487031},{"para_id":88,"paragraph":"It is said that\" great wits jump together,\" and it would appear that, under certain circumstances, the same saltatory exploit may be performed by a great and a small wit; for instance, Miss Martineau in her capital essay on the Lake District, treating of the inside cleanliness of the houses, makes nearly the same remark as I have made above.

I'll tell you all about him in as few words as possible. The Rev. Robert Walker was the youngest child in a family of twelve, who were all born to a small yeoman, at Undercrag, in this dale. He was born in 1709, and being sickly in boyhood, it was determined, in accordance with very general custom in such cases, to\" breed him a scholar.\" His father died when he was seventeen, and he soon obtained the appointment of parochial teacher at Gosforth, in Cumberland. After labouring there, and in the same capacity at Loweswater for some few years, he was ordained to the living of Buttermere-- the smallest Chapel, and, by no means the largest living, in England. His income as incumbent of Buttermere, even though eked out by teaching, being insufficient for his wants, moderate as they were, he worked hard, when his clerical and pedagogical duties permitted, as a common country labourer, span, knitted, and acted as private secretary and scrivener general, and sometimes as marketing agent in sheep, wool,&amp; c., to all his neighbours. Amongst other modes of raising the needful whilst at Buttermere, I have been told by one of his Seathwaite neighbours, that he taught the Buttermerians the art of drawing their lake and the adjacent lake of Crummock with the draught net, and for this service he was paid at the extravagant rate of one halfpenny for every draught they took, whilst he remained amongst them. After this he obtained the living of Torver, a small Chapelry, under Ulverstone, situate a mile or two from Conistone down the west side of the lake; and shortly after that, he attained the great object of his very natural ambition-- the ministry of this his native valley; married a wife with a fortune of forty pounds, and yet did not allow hid strict habits of economy and industry to slacken. There was no labour too mean for him to engage in; indeed his daily routine of employment as given by his trumpeter-in-chief, Mr Wordsworth, is such as few Bishops in these degenerate days would permit a clergyman to indulge in. Listen to it--\" Eight hours in each day, during five days in the week, and half of Saturday, except when the labours of husbandry were urgent, he was occupied in teaching. His seat was within the rails of the altar: the communion table was his desk; and, like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were repeating their lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours, if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour, exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel at which he had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping to and fro. Thus was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants,&amp; c., with pecuniary gain to himself and to the great benefit of his employers.

She unfortunately had been too late, and had walked onwards, as was supposed, under the impresson that he was behind and would overtake her. However that might be, no alarm was felt on her account at home, until Miss Tyson, the clergyman's daughter, called at the cottage on her way from Eskdale, and it then came out that she had not been seen there, though that was the sixth day after her departure. The neighbourhood was alarmed instantly, and a long line of willing and anxious friends, taking the whole breadth of the wild moor before them, soon discovered her body lying about forty yards from the road, where, but for the continual misty state of the atmosphere during the whole week, she must have been discovered days before by people passing along the road. The lacerated condition of her hands and knees and her torn dress shewed that the poor old woman, after losing the power of walking, had struggled onwards, no one knows how far, upon her hands and knees: she had taken out her spectacles, as it was thought to assist her in see - ing her way through the bewildering mist; and she had lost a handkerchief, containing oranges for her grandchildren, at some distance from the spot where she died. I am well qualified to speak as to what the poor old creature must have suffered from the weather, for I had to cross over Walna Scar( which is near two thousand feet high) twice upon the day she perished, and though I am tolerably robust, and had the assistance of an active pony, I nearly sunk under it myself.

The hollows in the road, which are neither few nor far between, were filled with snow in a state of semifluidity, cold as if it had been melted with salt, through which I splashed and struggled, dragging my floundering, jaded pony after me with the greatest difficulty. Though my road was over a much greater elevation than Mary Hird's, hers would be nearly as much exposed to the weather and as completely covered in by the smothering mist; it is therefore not to be wondered at that, though an active hale old woman, she sank upon the dreary moor.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Ulverstone",119,129],["Birker Moor",164,175],["Eskdale",190,197],["Birker Moor",324,335],["Eskdale",630,637],["Walna Scar",1677,1687]],"geonouns":[["road",336,340],["cottage",606,613],["line",797,801],["moor",871,875],["road",947,951],["road",1105,1109],["country",1997,2004],["road",2037,2041],["beck",2067,2071],["beck",2083,2087],["river",2090,2095],["lands",2107,2112],["mountain",2258,2266],["hollows",2505,2512],["road",2520,2524],["road",2781,2785],["moor",3045,3049]],"pos_words":[["friendly",246,254],["overtake",469,477],["instantly",775,784],["willing",805,812],["well",1559,1563],["qualified",1564,1573],["robust",1786,1792],["soft",1943,1947],["like",2467,2471],["greatest",2750,2758],["hale",3004,3008]],"neg_words":[["unfortunately",346,359],["alarm",509,514],["alarmed",767,774],["anxious",817,824],["wild",866,870],["lying",914,919],["poor",1193,1197],["losing",1215,1221],["struggled",1248,1257],["bewildering",1414,1425],["mist",1426,1430],["lost",1444,1448],["died",1548,1552],["poor",1598,1602],["suffered",1626,1634],["sunk",1845,1849],["cold",2140,2144],["mist",2167,2171],["cold",2615,2619],["struggled",2685,2694],["dragging",2696,2704],["floundering",2708,2719],["jaded",2721,2726],["difficulty",2759,2769],["mist",2937,2941],["dreary",3038,3044]],"events":[],"dates":[["February",20,28],["1848",38,42],["the end of the",309,323],["the sixth day",710,723],["forty",926,931],["the whole week",1019,1033],["days",1065,1069],["the day",1738,1745],["a day",1906,1911]],"times":[["the afternoon",3,16],["hour",301,305],["three seconds",2421,2434]],"distances":[["two thousand feet",1703,1720]],"loc_advs":[["left",48,52],["home",53,57],["home",542,546],["there",687,692],["between",2556,2563]],"spa_preps":[["over",159,163],["under",420,425],["behind",452,458],["out",656,659],["about",920,925],["along",1095,1100],["out",1329,1332],["through",1402,1409],["over",1672,1676],["near",1698,1702],["under",1850,1855],["under",1920,1925],["through",2656,2663],["over",2790,2794]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0557620818,"vader_sentiment":-0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9980489016},{"para_id":160,"paragraph":"Chapter Vi.

Mr Parkinson, canon of Manchester,&amp; c., which, possibly, you may have read. If you have, you may remark how strangely inaccurate the amiable author is in his local geography. To take one instance of many, he represents the sister of his hero to have the very reprehensible habit of slipping out of the paternal door, after bed-time, somewhere about the head of Yewdale, as near as I can fix it, and tripping it deftly over hill and dale, to meet her scamp of a sweetheart in this little dell. The said sweetheart must have been a very irresistible, as well as a very unreasonable personage, to entice a decent man's daughter to enact the cart going to the horse, and give him the meeting so far from home-- for the distance is a little short of a round dozen miles from home-- and she is described as taking the rough wild road that you have travelled over in this excursion. It is\" rather of the ratherest,\" and moreover, though this same custom of\" meeting by night in the shady boreen\" may suit a taste so romantic as that of the reverend author, it is not the custom of the daughters of these dales, who, with a careful regard for personal comfort and security from interruption, always have their wooers within the house after the family retire to rest; and I may quote Anderson, the Cumbrian bard, in support of the correctness of this statement, premising that the customs of this portion of Lancashire are, in all respects, similar to those in Cumberland and Westmorland. He says,--\" A Cumbrian peasant pays his addresses to his sweetheart during the silence and solemnity of midnight, when every bosom is at rest, except those of love and sorrow. Anticipating her kindness, he will travel ten or twelve miles over hills, bogs, moors and mosses, undiscouraged by the length of the road, the darkness of the night, or the intemperature of the weather. On reaching her habitation, he gives a gentle tap at the window of her chamber, at which signal she immediately rises, dresses herself, and proceeds, with all possible silence, to the door, which she gently opens, lest a creeking hinge or a barking dog should awaken the family. ** Next the courtship commences, previously to which the fire is darkened or extinguished, lest its light should guide to the window some idle or licentious eye. In this dark and uncomfortable situation( at least uncomfortable to all but lovers), they remain till the advance of day,\" and so on, concluding with some moralizing remarks upon this naughty custom, which I do not feel myself called upon to repeat. These\" sittings,\" which are in constant practice all over these northern counties, and which, after all, are not so bad as the Scotch and Welsh sweethearting customs, generally come off on the Saturday nights; and this practice, which involves the violation of the Sabbath, as well as the breach of decorum, is unnoticed, or rather winked at, by most writers who pretend to describe\" life and manners\" in the Lake country, such as Wilson, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and, lastly, Mr Parkinson. In fact, there appears a design amongst that tribe of writers to cry up the inhabitants of secluded districts such as these, at the expense of the inhabitants of towns. I am ready to do battle in this cause under the banner of Miss Martineau, who, in her triumphant answer to the arguments of those who opposed the introduction of railways into the Lake district, on the plea, amongst others equally absurd, that the morality of the people would suffer from contact with the denizens of towns, who, it was dreaded, would avail themselves in crowds of the increased facilities of transit, says--\" As for the fear that the innocent rural population will be morally corrupted by intercourse with people from the towns, we have no apprehension of this, but are disposed to hope rather than fear certain consequences from the increased intercourse of the mountaineers with the people of large towns. We doubt at once the innocence of the one party, and the specific corruption of the other. Scarcely anything can be conceived more lifeless, unvaried, and unideal, than the existence of the dalesmen and their families; and where the intellect is left so idle and unimproved as among them, the sensual vices are sure to prevail. These vices rage in the villages and small towns; and probably no clergyman or justice of the peace will be ever heard speaking of the rural innocence of the region,-- which is, indeed, to be found only in works of the imagination. The people have their virtues many and great.\"-- And so they have! but as to their morals being purer, or their lives and conversation more innocent than those of the parallel classes in towns, it is all nonsense. My life has been about equally divided between town and country, the nature of my occupation has given me much-- I hope not wasted-- opportunity in both of noting human nature en dishabille, and I tell you that good and evil in town and country, in crowded capital and lonely fell-dale, are\" much of a muchness.\" As a general rule, you may safely aver that the best educated community, is also the best behaved, and the standard of education amongst our mountaineers is by no means a high one.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Old Church",53,63],["Yewdale",457,464],["Lancashire",1495,1505],["Cumberland",1548,1558],["Westmorland",1563,1574],["Wordsworth",3085,3095]],"geonouns":[["door",407,411],["bed",419,422],["head",449,453],["hill",519,523],["dale",528,532],["dell",583,587],["road",919,923],["dales",1193,1198],["house",1316,1321],["hills",1819,1824],["bogs",1826,1830],["moors",1832,1837],["road",1885,1889],["door",2139,2143],["country",3060,3067],["districts",3236,3245],["towns",3298,3303],["railways",3467,3475],["district",3490,3498],["towns",3623,3628],["towns",3845,3850],["towns",4024,4029],["villages",4383,4391],["towns",4402,4407],["towns",4778,4783],["town",4852,4856],["country",4861,4868],["town",5033,5037],["country",5042,5049],["fell",5081,5085],["dale",5086,5090]],"pos_words":[["amiable",229,236],["hero",333,337],["sweetheart",557,567],["sweetheart",598,608],["irresistible",631,643],["well",648,652],["entice",690,696],["decent",699,705],["romantic",1105,1113],["regard",1220,1226],["comfort",1240,1247],["support",1403,1410],["sweetheart",1633,1643],["love",1735,1739],["kindness",1769,1777],["gentle",1994,2000],["well",2923,2927],["ready",3310,3315],["triumphant",3391,3401],["morality",3553,3561],["peace",4453,4458],["works",4565,4570],["great",4630,4635],["good",5016,5020],["safely",5145,5151],["aver",5152,5156],["best",5166,5170],["educated",5171,5179],["best",5203,5207]],"neg_words":[["odd",35,38],["strangely",204,213],["inaccurate",214,224],["reprehensible",355,368],["unreasonable",663,675],["rough",908,913],["wild",914,918],["shady",1071,1076],["interruption",1266,1278],["sorrow",1744,1750],["darkness",1895,1903],["darkened",2299,2307],["idle",2372,2376],["licentious",2380,2390],["dark",2404,2408],["uncomfortable",2413,2426],["uncomfortable",2447,2460],["naughty",2580,2587],["bad",2762,2765],["violation",2894,2903],["breach",2935,2941],["unnoticed",2957,2966],["pretend",3009,3016],["cry",3201,3204],["plea",3507,3511],["absurd",3536,3542],["suffer",3582,3588],["fear",3743,3747],["corrupted",3799,3808],["apprehension",3863,3875],["fear",3922,3926],["doubt",4034,4039],["corruption",4097,4107],["lifeless",4162,4170],["idle",4285,4289],["rage",4371,4375],["nonsense",4795,4803],["evil",5025,5029],["crowded",5054,5061],["lonely",5074,5080]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",2513,2516],["Saturday",2839,2847]],"times":[["night",1058,1063],["midnight",1680,1688],["the night",1907,1916],["nights",2848,2854]],"distances":[["a round dozen miles",841,860],["ten or twelve miles",1794,1813]],"loc_advs":[["somewhere",429,438],["near",469,473],["there",3145,3150],["left",4277,4281],["between",4844,4851]],"spa_preps":[["out",387,390],["about",439,444],["over",514,518],["over",948,952],["within",1305,1311],["over",1814,1818],["over",2699,2703],["amongst",3168,3175],["under",3343,3348],["into",3476,3480],["amongst",3513,3520],["among",4308,4313],["about",4822,4827],["amongst",5247,5254]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0240174672,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9992426634},{"para_id":169,"paragraph":"But quitting this subject, on which we might prose till midnight, you had better commence the ascent of Walna Scar, and youed also better gird up your loins, and make up your mind to encounter a labour of no ordinary magnitude; but as you rest and look back occasionally, the view rewards you well for your labour.

They have an extraordinary method of taking the fox, when they trace him to one of these rocky hiding-places; they draw him out with a screw, like a cork from the neck of a bottle.

After practising the ordinary routine of a witchwoman's life for several years, it is said that, as the time drew near for the fulfilment of her shortsighted bargain, she was seized with terror and remorse, and resolved to try whether she might not find a means of nullifying the agreement and evading payment of the fearful penalty to be exacted from her in return for the evil power with which her master had endued her old age; and, with this object, she visited a holy man, one of the Monks of Saint Mary of Furness, who was stationed at the place now called Bank Ground, which stands pleasantly upon the opposite side of the lake. He, when made aware of all the bearings of the case, offered some hope of redemption from the consequences of her contract, on the conditions of teetotal abstinence from any future indulgence in the evil art, abnegation of the devil, his works and devices, and a course of penance so severe and protracted, as to make the penitent witch think the cure almost as bad as the disease; but concern for\" her pore sole,\" as Winifred Jenkins pathetically designates it, determined her to accept of Father Brian's terms, provided he could secure her against the powers of Satan in the interim. Being instructed to flee for her life, and to call loudly upon Father Brian and Saint Herbert for aid, should Beelzebub come, as was likely, to claim his own before the completion of her saying penance had rescued her from his dreaded clutches, she returned home, and turned over a new leaf, beginning to lead a tolerably exemplary life. As might be expected, the other contracting party was not long in hearing of this unpardonable breach of faith, and, one evening, he startled his quondam disciple by making his appearance at the door of her domicile, when she, remembering the Monk's instructions, darted through the open window, and fled, with the speed of light, directly up the course of this beck, screaming loudly enough for succour as directed. She had reached the site of this bridge, and her pursuer was just about to lay his claws upon her, when the Saint, or the Monk, or both heard her, and the devil's foot, not the cloven one,-- for neither dead Saint nor living Priest can be supposed to have power over that,-- but his other foot, was set upon that stone, the heel sank into the ridge upon its surface, and the stone hardening, he was held fast by the heel, and thus, by the miraculous intervention of the dead Saint or the living Monk-- I cannot learn exactly whether-- the penitent witch escaped; and, moreover, ere the devil was released, Father Brian, being well versed in this particular line of business, succeeded in obtaining possession of the document on which the claim upon the old woman's soul was founded, and so was able to remit a considerable portion of her heavy penance. The print, much too large to be produced by any human heel, is, as you see, still there to testify to the truth of the history I have collated for your special behoof, and, therefore, I hope that you will readily recognise its perfect credibility.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Furness",991,998]],"geonouns":[["common",93,99],["point",410,415],["land",419,423],["lake",444,448],["mouth",458,463],["brook",472,477],["lake",1109,1113],["door",2234,2238],["beck",2401,2405],["bridge",2489,2495],["foot",2619,2623],["foot",2745,2749],["stone",2769,2774],["ridge",2799,2804],["stone",2831,2836],["line",3113,3117]],"pos_words":[["bargain",637,644],["master",879,885],["holy",947,951],["pleasantly",1068,1078],["redemption",1189,1199],["indulgence",1296,1306],["works",1353,1358],["cure",1462,1466],["secure",1646,1652],["lead",2006,2010],["exemplary",2023,2032],["faith",2144,2149],["enough",2424,2430],["fast",2860,2864],["miraculous",2895,2905],["well",3082,3086],["succeeded",3131,3140],["readily",3514,3521],["perfect",3536,3543]],"neg_words":[["ugly",139,143],["poor",174,178],["evil",256,260],["devil",359,364],["shortsighted",624,636],["terror",666,672],["remorse",677,684],["fearful",796,803],["penalty",804,811],["evil",853,857],["object",925,931],["evil",1314,1318],["devil",1342,1347],["severe",1399,1405],["protracted",1410,1420],["bad",1477,1480],["concern",1501,1508],["pathetically",1550,1562],["flee",1721,1725],["breach",2134,2140],["devil",2611,2616],["dead",2659,2663],["dead",2926,2930],["devil",3042,3047]],"events":[],"dates":[["several years",544,557],["Satan",1679,1684]],"times":[["one evening",2156,2167]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",180,187],["near",449,453],["home",1959,1963],["there",3391,3396]],"spa_preps":[["into",435,439],["near",593,597],["opposite",1088,1096],["against",1657,1664],["over",1976,1980],["through",2310,2317],["about",2522,2527],["over",2718,2722],["into",2790,2794]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0154798762,"vader_sentiment":-0.96,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973978996},{"para_id":181,"paragraph":"You will now return to the road, and move on towards the village by the Crown Inn, a very commodious, respectable, and well-conducted house of entertainment for man and beast, with unexceptionable accommodation, and a more than unexceptionable hostess.

You want to know what made the attempts unsuccessful! Upon my word, I can scarcely tell you; but I can give you Mr De Quincey's own account of the matter, as detailed in his interesting autobiographical sketches in Tait's Magazine:--\" My delay\"-- in accepting a long-standing invitation--\" was due to anything rather than to waning interest. On the contrary, the real cause of my delay was the too great profundity, and the increasing profundity of my interest in this regeneration of our national poetry; and the increasing awe, in due proportion to the decaying thoughtlessness of boyhood, which possessed me for the character of its author. So far from neglecting Wordsworth, it is a fact,( and Professor Wilson who, without knowing me in those, or for many subsequent years, shared my feelings towards both the poetry and the poet, has a story of his own experience somewhat similar to report)-- it is a fact, I say, that twice I had undertaken a long journey expressly for the purpose of paying my respects to Wordsworth; twice I came so far as the little rustic inn( at that time the sole inn in the neighbourhood) at Church Conistone-- the village which stands at the north-western angle of Conistone Water; and on neither occasion could I summon confidence enough to appear before him. *** The very image of Wordsworth, as I pre-figured it to my own planet-struck eye, crushed my faculties as before Elijah or St. Paul. Twice, as I said, did I advance as far as the lake of Conistone, which is about eight miles from the church at Grasmere, and once I absolutely went forward from Conistone to the very gorge of Hammerscar, from which the whole vale of Grasmere suddenly breaks upon the view. Catching one glimpse of this loveliest of landscapes, I retreated like a guilty thing, for fear I might be surprised by Wordsworth, and then returned faint-heartedly to Conistone, and so to Oxford re infect\u00e2. This was in 1806-- and thus far, from mere excess of nervous distrust in my own powers for sustaining a conversation with Wordsworth, I had, for nearly five years, shrunk from a meeting for which, beyond all things under heaven, I longed. These, the reader will say, were foolish feelings.\" Very possible, indeed, that the reader may say so, Mr De Quincey! more particularly if he hold with me the opinion that the man who records his experience of those feelings, is, though inferior in genius, certainly superior in scholastic acquirements to the object of his idolatrous awe.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Black Bull",10,20],["Wordsworth",188,198],["Grasmere",228,236],["Wordsworth",905,915],["Wordsworth",1253,1263],["Conistone",1436,1445],["Wordsworth",1554,1564],["Conistone",1720,1729],["Grasmere",1777,1785],["Conistone",1827,1836],["Grasmere",1899,1907],["Wordsworth",2059,2069],["Conistone",2108,2117],["Oxford",2129,2135],["Wordsworth",2270,2280]],"geonouns":[["inn",1306,1309],["inn",1333,1336],["village",1385,1392],["lake",1712,1716],["church",1767,1773],["vale",1891,1895],["landscapes",1981,1991],["mere",2186,2190]],"pos_words":[["interesting",412,423],["great",636,641],["awe",763,766],["confidence",1492,1502],["enough",1503,1509],["like",2005,2009],["heaven",2369,2375],["genius",2636,2642],["superior",2654,2662],["awe",2722,2725]],"neg_words":[["unsuccessful",153,165],["unsuccessful",278,290],["scarcely",312,320],["waning",563,569],["delay",618,623],["thoughtlessness",802,817],["struck",1603,1609],["crushed",1615,1622],["breaks",1917,1923],["retreated",1995,2004],["guilty",2012,2018],["fear",2030,2034],["faint",2089,2094],["nervous",2201,2208],["distrust",2209,2217],["foolish",2420,2427],["inferior",2624,2632],["object",2697,2703]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",69,73],["many subsequent years",994,1015],["1806",2160,2164],["nearly five years",2293,2310]],"times":[],"distances":[["about eight miles",1740,1757]],"loc_advs":[["without",958,965],["forward",1814,1821]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",2345,2351],["under",2363,2368]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0325203252,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9942880273},{"para_id":190,"paragraph":"At the period of the English opium-eater's sojourn at the Black Bull, its domestic affairs would be under the control of Mrs Robinson, the eldest daughter of\" Wonderful Walker,\" and quite as wonderful a person, in her way, as her more celebrated father. In early life, she was wooed, won, and privately married by a respectable working miner named Bamford, who subsequently obtained an appointment as sub-agent and clerk at the Leadhills Mines, in Dumfriesshire. During her husband's protracted last illness, she, having in common with all Parson Walker's children, received an excellent education, discharged his duties as clerk, or accountant, in a manner so satisfactory to the Mining Managers, that, after his death, she was allowed to continue in his office and lift his salary, until an alteration in the management caused her removal. She then returned to her father at Seathwaite Parsonage, and she continued with him for some time, until her favour was sought by her second\" venture,\" Robinson. To his pretensions the patriarchal pastor was, however, unfavourable, and he kept such strict watch upon their movements, that they found it impossible to transact the requisite courtship in a satisfactory manner, until she contrived to give her lover an impression of the out-door key in dough, and he got a duplicate manufactured therefrom, which admitted him to her society when\" Wonderful Walker\" was safe in the land of dreams. At these stolen meetings, a marriage was arranged, which came off in spite of all obstacles, and they settled on the farm called Townend, on the eastern side of Conistone Lake. A simple anecdote I have heard, may serve to illustrate Mrs Robinson's shrewd and upright character. One Sunday afternoon, some Conistone youths crossed the lake, and bought of her husband a quantity of apples. Some dispute arising as to the partition of the purchase, it was agreed that Robinson should divide them. Her quick eye detected him giving a larger share to one than the rest, when she called out,\" Nay, nay, Thomas! if thou will make Tom Park a present, bring him out some of thy own, but do n't give away other folks' apples.\" From Townend, they removed to the Black Bull, where she remained for many years. She discharged the duties of parish officer in her own turn, and in that of her son-in-law, and the parish books yet bear testimony to the beauty of her hand-writing, and the accuracy and clearness of her accounts. She also managed a small woollen mill, carried on here by the late Mr Gandy, of Kendal; and even in extreme old age, when bent double by years and infirmity, so that she could not sit upon a chair without leaning forward upon a table, she would write for hours with her books upon her knee. Of the Black Bull there is little more to say, than that mine especial good friend, Mrs Bell, is, as hostess, in every respect a worthy successor of Mrs Robinson, and if you choose to place yourself under her care, and do n't feel comfortable, the fault will not be hers.

My authority is a condensed history of the Fleming family, on referring to which I find that\" Michael, the sixth son of Sir Daniel Fleming, was Major in the regiment commanded by the Hon. Col. Stanley, afterwards Earl of Derby, was in most of the sieges and battles in Flanders daring the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, and was returned to Parliament for Westmorland in 1706.\" I fancy he would be great-grandfather to the estimable lady who now holds the estates and honours of her ancient house. The other brother remembered by the old man would be, as I have reason to believe, Sir Daniel's eighth son, Roger Fleming, who entered the church, and became Vicar of Brigham, a preferment enjoyed at the present day, not by a son of the Knight of Rydal Hall, but by a son of the Bard of Rydal Mount.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Hause",88,93],["Hause",144,149],["Westmorland",1411,1422],["Rydal Hall",1800,1810],["Rydal Mount",1840,1851]],"geonouns":[["cottages",38,46],["cottage",214,221],["house",269,274],["door",553,557],["house",1546,1551],["church",1692,1698]],"pos_words":[["intelligent",103,114],["great",312,317],["remarkable",672,682],["worthy",688,694],["correct",747,754],["great",854,859],["fine",1026,1030],["loyalty",1039,1046],["daring",1326,1332],["fancy",1435,1440],["great",1453,1458],["enjoyed",1742,1749]],"neg_words":[["died",302,306],["scramble",495,503],["obnoxious",920,929]],"events":[],"dates":[["annual",1019,1025],["1706",1426,1430],["the present day",1753,1768]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["past",15,19],["there",469,474]],"spa_preps":[["around",47,53],["down",62,66],["amongst",522,529],["round",543,548],["under",844,849]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0532544379,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9973714352},{"para_id":197,"paragraph":"We have not done yet with Hause Bank, for you should be told that the old-fashioned house in the fold, surrounded by equally old-fashioned farm-buildings, was formerly the residence of Lieutenant Oldfield , R.N., and is still possessed by his widow.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Hause",26,31]],"geonouns":[["house",84,89],["farm",139,143],["buildings",144,153],["residence",172,181]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9940180779},{"para_id":198,"paragraph":"This Mr Oldfield rose from before the mast, and was made Lieutenant by Nelson himself, as a reward for very important service rendered on a critical occasion-- that of piloting the fleet through an intricate and dangerous navigation at the entrance of the Baltic, previous to","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["entrance",240,248]],"pos_words":[["reward",92,98],["important",108,117],["intricate",198,207]],"neg_words":[["critical",140,148],["dangerous",212,221]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["through",187,194]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0454545455,"vader_sentiment":0.25,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977057576},{"para_id":199,"paragraph":"--\" the glorious day's renown When to battle fierce came forth All the might of Denmark's crown.\"","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["glorious",8,16],["renown",23,29]],"neg_words":[["fierce",45,51]],"events":[],"dates":[["day",17,20]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0666666667,"vader_sentiment":0.38,"roberta_sentiment":0.9918612242},{"para_id":200,"paragraph":"The Danes had lifted all the buoys, and taken other measures to place difficulties in the way of the British fleet gaining the anchorage off Copenhagen, and no other man but Oldfield was to be found in the whole fleet, who would undertake a pilot's responsibility under such circumstances.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[["gaining",115,122]],"neg_words":[["difficulties",70,82]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["under",264,269]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.08,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9987541437},{"para_id":201,"paragraph":"Leaving Hause Bank, you next pass\" Piper Hole,\" and soon after reach Park Gate, the farthest houses in the village in this direction.

These are the works belonging to the Copper Mines, which Copper Mines were in existence when Christianity was not, for there is good reason to believe that copper was wrought here, and that extensively, by the Romans during their first occupation of the country, and also by the Britons before them. In support of this supposition, I beg to offer an extract, bearing upon the subject, from that very grave and erudite work, Mr A' Beckett's History of England. \" Before quitting the subject of Caesar's invasion, it may be interesting to the reader to know something of the weapons with which the early Britons attempted to defend themselves. Their swords were made of copper, and generally bent with the first blow, which must have greatly straitened their aggressive resources, for the swords thus followed their own bent, instead of carrying out the intention of the persons using them.

Their attitudes are somewhat picturesque, as they hold up and turn the jumper with the left hand, whilst they keep driving it into the flinty rock by an incessant rapping with a hammer held in the right. Having bored their holes to a sufficient depth, they proceed to clear them out with an iron instrument something like a yard-long needle, with its point bent and flattened-- first scraping out the borings or fragments of stone, with the point, and then drying the hole with a small wisp of straw, or dried grass, drawn through the eye, and worked up and down in the hole until all moisture is completely mopped up. They then fill a tin tube with gunpowder, and conveying it into the hole, withdraw the tube and leave the hole filled to one - third, or one - half its depth with the powder. Having corked down, by way of wadding, the wisp used in drying, and carefully cleaned away any stray grains of powder which may possibly adhere to the sides, they next thrust a long sharpened rod of copper, called a\" pricker,\" down one side into the powder, and pass an iron\" stemmer,\" or ramrod, grooved on one side to fit the pricker, to feel whether it work easily, which it will not do, if the pricker be improperly inserted.

Having got it out, they pass down the hole it leaves a long straw filled with powder, having a piece of matchpaper attached to its outer extremity; and having secured their tools, and uttered two or three indescribable warning shouts, the precise sound of which it is difficult to realize, but which consist of the monosyllable\" fire,\" they ignite the touch-paper and immediately retire to a respectful distance, and you had better retire with them, to await the report, which, when it does occur, will be pretty likely to make you jump an inch or two out of your skin.

Well, first, you perceive, it is thrown from the waggons into a heap, where water runs over it, and by cleaning the lumps, shews more plainly what each piece is made of. Then from the heap it is raked by men to a platform, or long low bench, along which a number of little boys are actively engaged in picking or separating the richer pieces from the poorer, and it is highly amusing to watch the expertness and celerity with which the imps make the selection, and toss each lump into its proper receptacle. The richest portion is carried at once to the crushing mill, the poorer is thrown into another shed below, to be broken up and farther picked, and the mere stones are wheeled off to the rubbish heap. The ore being broken small is thrown into the crashing mill, and passed once or twice through it, being returned to the mill by an endless chain of iron buckets, which dip into the heap of crashed ore below, and, carrying it up, empty themselves into the mill. When ground to the size of coarse sand, the ore is carried to the\" jigging troughs,\" which are large square boxes, filled with water, and having each a smaller box, with a grated bottom, suspended in it to a beam above, and filled with ore, a\" jigging\" motion being imparted to the grated boxes by water-power. This jigging under water causes the grains of pure ore which are heavy, to sink and pass through the grating of the inner box, and the particles of spar and rock, which are lighter, to rise to the top, whence they are scooped off and wheeled away to undergo another pounding and washing. The pounding is effected by means of two long rows of stamps or heavy iron-shod pestles, kept incessantly rising and falling in beds fronted with perforated iron plates, and fed with the material, and a flow of water to wash it, when fine enough, through the holed plate.

All the waste water used in any of the dressing processes is made to flow through a series of large tanks or reservoirs, in which it deposits all the fine particles of ore that may be float - ing away, and from these tanks some thousands of pounds' worth of ore is collected annually in the form of slime and looking like bronze, which with all the other ore is shipped to Swansea to be smelted.","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["pass",116,120],["market",147,153],["ground",246,252],["water",330,335],["mere",913,917],["stones",918,924],["ground",1228,1234],["water",1350,1355],["water",1521,1526],["water",1553,1558],["pass",1618,1622],["rock",1691,1695],["top",1731,1734],["beds",1950,1954],["water",2033,2038],["head",2219,2223],["stream",2292,2298],["water",2302,2307],["head",2455,2459],["water",2549,2554]],"pos_words":[["safely",16,22],["work",204,208],["richer",582,588],["amusing",630,637],["proper",743,749],["pure",1580,1584],["lighter",1707,1714],["fine",2056,2060],["enough",2061,2067],["valuable",2423,2431],["lighter",2472,2479],["fine",2685,2689],["worth",2784,2789],["like",2852,2856]],"neg_words":[["raked",449,454],["poorer",605,611],["crushing",808,816],["poorer",827,833],["broken",875,881],["rubbish",948,955],["broken",976,982],["crashing",1008,1016],["crashed",1151,1158],["coarse",1250,1256],["sink",1609,1613],["grating",1635,1642],["incessantly",1916,1927],["falling",1939,1946],["limited",2284,2291],["slowly",2352,2358],["worthless",2484,2493],["waste",2543,2548],["tanks",2635,2640],["tanks",2752,2757],["slime",2834,2839]],"events":[],"dates":[["every-day",40,49],["the\"",1285,1289],["annually",2810,2818]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",1436,1441],["away",1776,1780]],"spa_preps":[["through",87,94],["above",240,245],["into",311,315],["over",341,345],["along",496,501],["into",734,738],["into",844,848],["below",862,867],["into",999,1003],["through",1048,1055],["into",1134,1138],["below",1163,1168],["into",1208,1212],["under",1547,1552],["through",1623,1630],["through",2069,2076],["through",2129,2136],["through",2329,2336],["down",2379,2383],["down",2512,2516],["through",2609,2616],["away",2731,2735]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0269230769,"vader_sentiment":0.45,"roberta_sentiment":0.9967106581},{"para_id":224,"paragraph":"An impression is general that the people employed here are more than ordinarily\" ignorant and profligate.\" Nothing could be farther from the truth than such a supposition.

That daughter of Colonel Smith who drew the public attention so powerfully upon herself by the splendour of her attainments, had died some months before I came into the country. But yet, as I was subsequently acquainted with her family through the Lloyds( who were within an easy drive of Tent Lodge), and as, moreover, with regard to Miss Elizabeth Smith herself, I came to know more than the world knew-- drawing my knowledge from many of her friends, but especially from Mrs Hannah More, who had been intimately connected with her, for these reasons, I shall rehearse the leading points of her story; and the rather because her family, who were equally interested in that story, long continued to form part of the lake society. On my first becoming acquainted with Miss Smith's pretensions, it is true that I regarded them with but little concern, for nothing ever interests me less than great philological attainments, or, at least, that mode of philological learning which consists in mastery over languages. But one reason for this indifference is, that the apparent splendour is too often a false one. They who know a vast number of languages, rarely know any one with accuracy; and the more they gain in one way, the more they lose in another. With Miss Smith, however, I gradually came to know that this was not the case, or, at any rate, but partially the case; for of some languages which she possessed, and those the least accessible, it appeared finally that she had even a critical knowledge. It created also a secondary interest in these difficult accomplishments of hers to find that they were so very extensive. Secondly, that they were nearly all of self-acquisition. Thirdly, that they were borne so meekly, and with unaffected absence of all ostentation. As to the first point, it appears that she made herself mistress of the French, the Italian, the Spanish, the Latin, the German, the Greek, and the Hebrew languages. She had no inconsiderable knowledge of the Syriac, the Arabic, and the Persic. She was a good geometrician and algebraist. She was a very expert musician. She drew from nature, and had an accurate knowledge of perspective. Finally, she manifested an early talent for poetry; but, from pure modesty, destroyed most of what she had written, as her acquaintance with the Hebrew models had elevated the standard of true poetry in her mind, so as to disgust her with what she now viewed as the tameness and inefficiency of her own performances. As to the second point-- that for these attainments she was indebted almost exclusively to her own energy, this is placed beyond all doubt, by the fact, that the only governess she ever had( a young lady not much beyond her own age) did not herself possess, and therefore could not have communicated any knowledge of languages, beyond a little French and Italian. Finally, as to the modesty with which she wore her distinctions, that is sufficiently established by every page of her printed works, and her letters. Greater diffidence as respected herself or less willingness to obtrude her knowledge upon strangers, or even upon those correspondents who would have wished her to make a little more display, cannot be imagined. And yet I repeat that her knowledge was as sound and as profound as it was extensive. For, taking only one instance of this, her translation of Job has been pronounced by Biblical critics of the first rank, a work of real and intrinsic value, without any reference to the disadvantages of the translation, or without needing any allowance whatever. In particular, Dr Magee, the celebrated writer on the Atonement, and subsequently a dignitary of the Irish Church-- certainly one of the best qualified judges at that time-- describes it as' conveying more of the character and meaning of the Hebrew, with fewer departures from the idiom of the English, than any other translation whatever that we possess.'\"","file_id":"1849_a","plnames":[["Elizabeth",569,578],["German",2125,2131]],"geonouns":[["lake",115,119],["country",398,405],["points",812,818],["lake",946,950],["point",2020,2025]],"pos_words":[["loving",13,19],["powerfully",293,303],["easy",504,508],["regard",554,560],["leading",804,811],["interests",1097,1106],["great",1120,1125],["mastery",1219,1226],["gain",1433,1437],["accessible",1664,1674],["accomplishments",1792,1807],["unaffected",1965,1975],["good",2259,2263],["accurate",2358,2366],["talent",2426,2432],["pure",2455,2459],["modesty",2460,2467],["indebted",2770,2778],["modesty",3093,3100],["sufficiently",3147,3159],["works",3201,3206],["willingness",3273,3284],["profound",3493,3501],["work",3646,3650],["celebrated",3815,3825],["best",3923,3927],["qualified",3928,3937]],"neg_words":[["died",358,362],["concern",1071,1078],["indifference",1267,1279],["false",1327,1332],["lose",1464,1468],["critical",1716,1724],["difficult",1782,1791],["absence",1976,1983],["mistress",2060,2068],["disgust",2615,2622],["inefficiency",2672,2684],["doubt",2843,2848],["diffidence",3233,3243],["critics",3617,3624],["disadvantages",3709,3722]],"events":[],"dates":[["many years",194,204],["some months",363,374]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",2923,2929],["without",3680,3687],["without",3746,3753]],"spa_preps":[["near",78,82],["into",389,393],["through",465,472],["within",494,500],["over",1227,1231],["beyond",2832,2838],["beyond",3038,3044]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0358208955,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9963241816},{"para_id":285,"paragraph":"Mr De Quincey next proceeds to\" briefly sketch her story\"-- mentioning her birth at Burnhall, in the county of Durham, in 1776-- the engagement of her governess-- the acquisition of, and removal of the family to\" the splendid inheritance of Piercefield, a show place on the banks of the Wye\"-- their numerous visitors there, and the influence of two of them( Mrs Bowdler and her daughter) in exciting in Miss Smith her ardent and enduring love of learning and piety-- the ruin that, in her 16th year, fell upon\" the house of Piercefield.

I have conversed with Mrs Hannah More often about her; and I never failed to draw forth some fresh anecdote illustrating the vast extent of her knowledge, the simplicity of her character, the gentleness of her manners, and her unaffected humility. She passed, it is true, almost inaudibly through life; and the stir which was made after her death, soon subsided. But die reason was, that she wrote but little!

Dick Hawksley, and a few more, darted off in immediate pursuit on foot, while several rushed to the stables, in obedience to the calls of their young masters, who were, one and all, loudly vociferating for their horses. Scarce a minute passed, ere half a dozen le Flemings, attended by as many mounted followers, were spurring like lightning through the wood in the direction of Yewdale. They came in sight of the Giant and his burthen as he neared Cauldron Dub, with the light-heeled falconer close behind, calling loudly upon him to stay his flight; but he held on with tremendous strides, till he reached the brow over the pool, when, finding that the horsemen were close upon him, and that it was hopeless to try to carry his prize farther, he stopped-- uttered one terrible shout of rage and disappointment-- and whirled his shrieking victim into the flooded beck, resuming his now unincumbered flight with increased speed. Dick Hawksley rushed over the bank a little lower down, and the horsemen, abandoning the chase, galloped to the brink of the stream, which was high with the recent rains. They saw the falconer plunge into the torrent, as the bower maiden, yet buoyant with her light garments, was borne rapidly down. They saw him seize her with one hand, and strike out gallantly for the bank with the other, but the current was too strong for him, encumbered as he was with the girl in his grasp. The devoted pair were swept down the stream, at a rate that made the spectators put their horses to a gallop to keep them in sight, even while the exertions of the brave falconer sufficed to sustain their heads above water, which was only till they came under the bridge, where the water, pent in by the narrow arch, acquired four - fold force, and there they heard him utter a hoarse cry of despair, and the gallant Hawksley and the Lady Eva's beauteous fa - vourite were seen no more, till their bodies were found, days after, on the shore far down the lake. One or two of the horsemen continued to gallop down the side of the beck, in the bootless hope of being able even yet to render them some aid, but the most of them turned their horses' heads, and went off once more at their utmost speed in pursuit of the murderous Giant. He, considering the chase at an end, had slackened his pace, and they were not long in overtaking him.
