Among the latter may be reckoned the New Forest in Hampshire, one of the largest in the kingdom, and Cranborn Chace in Dorsetshire. The soil is generally dry, and in some parts chalky. Cornwall is famous for the variety of valuable minerals which it affords, as well as stone for building; Devonshire and Dorsetshire produce great quantities of cider apples; Somersetshire and Wiltshire are remarkable for their manufactories of the best super-fine cloth, kerseymeres,&amp; c.; and Hampsire for its production of hops. - From London to about the middle of Yorkshire, keeping along the eastern side of the kingdom, a flat surface generally prevails, with a foil more or less loamy, and extremely fertile. Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire contain a great extent of fenny grounds, which, it is probable, were formerly covered with the fea. A great part of these fens, by being properly draned, is now converted to excellent meadow and pasture land. This is principally a farming district, the manufactures, which are different sorts of fine woollen stuffs, being confined, in a great measure, to Norwich and Colchester. Flint is almost the only species of stone found here; nor is coal to be met with, the inahbitants being supplied with that artcle from Newcastle and Sunderland.

Small detached strata of chalk are also discovered in other places, even as low down as Lincolnshire. - The manufactory of straw hats is carried on to a greater extent in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire than in any other place in the kingdom. The women are the principal manufacturers, and often earn more money by that work than their husbands can do by common labour.

Entering Westmoreland, they again dilate, and turbulently spread themselves over nearly all that county and the southern part of Cumberland. A principal branch of thesse mountains runs northwards, and, after separating Westmoreland from Yorkshire, and Cumberland from Durham and Northumberland, enters Scotland. - This range of hills is of different breadths, and generally presents a formidable and rather uniform front to the sest, mostly covered with green herbage. The tops of these ridges are usually wet, mossy, and boggy; and produce heath, bent-grafs, and rushes. Considered in Landscape, they are lumpish, and rarely picturesque; generally naked and destitute of wood, even at their bases. In this extensive chain of mountains limestone is rarely interrupted: the greatest part of that monster of Nature, Ingleboroughm is composed of calcareous substances, as are several hills of less note.

The first object that strikes us is the noble River Mersey winding along a flat country almost directly west, and opening a spacious inlet to the sea for several miles previous to its entrance into the main ocean at Liverpool. The western side of Lancashire looks low and level, with canals serpentising in every direction, and the sea making deep inroads on the coast. The eastern side swells into coarse high grounds, with intervening dales, which are continued, but with less elevation and more fertility, through a great part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Upon this ride of hills, which separates the two counties, the Lancashire rivers have their principal source on the one side, and many branches of the Ouse on the other. - The most astonishing feature, however, in this picture, is its great population. Supposing ourselves ascending to a sufficient height above the fine, spreading, modern-built town of Manchester, with a powerful command of sight, the country for 30 or 40 miles to the west, north, and east, will appear as one continued newly-erected village, scattered among little gardens and fields.

These heights are supposed to affect the weather in a manner somewhat similar to what the inahbitants of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts experience; and what are called in this country shedding-winds, generally blow on the contrary sides of Cross Fell, from oppote quarters to the helm-winds; and the storms which rake the country on one side of the mountain, seldom affect the other. Upon the summits of this lofty ridge of mountains there frequently hangs a vast volume of clouds, in a sullen and drowsy state, having little movement. This heavy collection of vapours often extends several miles in length, and dips itself from the summit half - way down to the base of those eminences; and frequently at the same time the other mountains in view are clear of mist, and shew no signs of rain. This helm, or cloud, exhibits an awful and solemn appearance, tinged with white by the sun's rays that strike the upper parts, and sreads a gloom below, over the inferior parts of the mountains, like the shadows of night. When this collection of vapour first begins to gather upon the hills, there is to be observed hanging about it a black strip of cloud, continually flying off, and fed from the white part, which is the real helm. This strip is called the helm-bar, as, during its appearance, the winds are thought to be resisted by it; for, on its dispersion, they rage vehemently upon the valleys beneath. The direction of the helm-bar is parallel to that part of the main cloud, or collection of vapour, that is tinged with white by being struck with the suns rays; the bar appears in continual agitation, as boiling or struggling with contrary blasts; whilst the helm all this time keeps a motionless station. When the bar is dispersed, the winds that issue from the helm are sometimes extremely violent; but that force seems to be in proportion to the real current of the winds which blow at a distance from the mountains, and which are frequently in a contrary direction, and then the helm-wind does not extend above two or three miles; without those impediments it seldom sweeps over a larger tract than twelve miles, perhaps from the mere resistance of the lower atmosphere. It is remarkable, that at the base of the mountain the blasts are much less violent than in the middle region; and yet the hurricane is sometimes impetuous even there, bearing everything before it, when at the distance of a few miles there is a dead calm and a sunny sky. The spring is most favourable to this phenomenon, the helm-wind will sometimes blow for a fortnight, till the air in the lower egions, warmed before by the influence of the sun, is thereby rendered piercing cold.","file_id":"1800_c","plnames":[["Cross Fell",401,411]],"geonouns":[["mountains",92,101],["coasts",290,296],["country",337,344],["country",483,490],["mountain",510,518],["summits",554,561],["ridge",576,581],["mountains",585,594],["summit",794,800],["mountains",891,900],["mountains",1139,1148],["hills",1240,1245],["valleys",1549,1556],["station",1863,1870],["force",1976,1981],["mountains",2075,2084],["mere",2300,2304],["mountain",2383,2391],["region",2444,2450]],"pos_words":[["clear",913,918],["like",1150,1154],["remarkable",2347,2357],["calm",2591,2595]],"neg_words":[["blow",371,375],["hangs",612,617],["sullen",648,654],["mist",922,926],["cloud",969,974],["awful",988,993],["solemn",998,1004],["strike",1058,1064],["gloom",1095,1100],["inferior",1117,1125],["cloud",1305,1310],["rage",1524,1528],["vehemently",1529,1539],["cloud",1633,1638],["struck",1700,1706],["boiling",1770,1777],["struggling",1781,1791],["motionless",1852,1862],["issue",1914,1919],["violent",1958,1965],["blow",2047,2051],["resistance",2305,2315],["violent",2417,2424],["impetuous",2487,2496],["dead",2586,2590],["blow",2692,2696],["cold",2820,2824]],"events":[],"dates":[["spring",2617,2623]],"times":[["night",1170,1175]],"distances":[["nearly forty miles",103,121],["several miles",744,757],["two or three miles",2181,2199],["twelve miles",2269,2281],["a few miles",2563,2574]],"loc_advs":[["there",595,600],["there",1247,1252],["beneath",1557,1564],["without",2201,2208],["there",2502,2507],["there",2575,2580]],"spa_preps":[["down",812,816],["below",1101,1106],["over",1108,1112],["about",1279,1284],["above",2175,2180],["over",2244,2248]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0954356846,"vader_sentiment":-0.95,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9653977156},{"para_id":56,"paragraph":"\" Mr. Ritson, that extraordinary genius, who wrote the introduction to Clarke's Survey to the Lakes, thus speaks of this helm-wind -' The helm-wind is generated in that enormous cloud, which, like a helmet, covers the summit of Cross Fell.

This wind is not much taken notice of in natural history; yet the Dutch, by the iron chains with which they are obliged to moor their ships at the Cape of Good Hope, bear ample testimony to the fury of such a one. It hath been met with by the late voyagers in the South Seas; it is said to have been felt in the Straits of Gibralter; and I doubt not that mariners and travellers have found it in many other places, though they may not have observed it with care, or may have given it different names.'","file_id":"1800_c","plnames":[["Lakes",94,99],["Cross Fell",228,238]],"geonouns":[["summit",218,224],["hills",394,399],["moor",559,563],["ships",570,575]],"pos_words":[["extraordinary",19,32],["genius",33,39],["like",192,196],["ample",607,612]],"neg_words":[["cloud",178,183],["rival",403,408],["fury",630,634],["doubt",776,781]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["about thirty miles",328,346]],"loc_advs":[["there",246,251],["there",308,313]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.83,"roberta_sentiment":0.9971832633},{"para_id":57,"paragraph":"\" Mr Richardson remarks -' That in the vicinity of these mountains the air is generally very clear and healthy, owing perhaps to the violent helm-winds in the months of December, January, Febuary, March, and April; but the inahbitants of the countries immediately influenced by that wind are more subject to rheumatic complaints than those at a greater distance. The summit of Cross fell, and the regions a little lower, are sometimes clear when the vale is covered with a fog. I have been upon the mountain when that has happened, and the spectacle is curious, as the clouds appear firm, though uneven, like a boisterous disturbed ocean. All distant sounds are at that time heard distinctly, and strike the ear in a very singular manner, as they seem to sssue under your feet. As to the helm, the cloud does not always rest on the tops of the hlls, but is sometimes several degrees higher, and does not always preserve a regular form; neither is there always a helm-bar, for that phenomenon only appears when the wind, at a little distance, blows from the west. I have sometimes observed four or five of these helm-bars within five miles of the hills, and then the wind blew irregularly, sometimes from the east, and sometimes from the west. It appears to me that the same kind of phenomenon as that at the Cape of Good Hope, described by Sparman. When the snow appears upon the hills, the winds then blow with great violence. Swinburn, I think, mentions something similar in Sicily, and Volney at Alexandria. May it not be accounted for by the air being considerably colder on the summit of those hulls, than in the country whither it rushes with so much violence? I have found by a thermometer, that it is 14 \u00b0 colder on the top of Cross Fell than at the bottom; indeed I did but prove that once, but three or four times I found it 12 \u00b0, and frequently 10 \u00b0.","file_id":"1800_c","plnames":[["Cross Fell",1735,1745]],"geonouns":[["mountains",57,66],["countries",242,251],["summit",367,373],["regions",397,404],["vale",450,454],["mountain",499,507],["feet",772,776],["hills",1146,1151],["hills",1380,1385],["summit",1583,1589],["country",1618,1625]],"pos_words":[["clear",93,98],["healthy",103,110],["clear",435,440],["like",604,608],["tops",832,836],["great",1412,1417],["top",1728,1731]],"neg_words":[["violent",133,140],["complaints",318,328],["fell",383,387],["uneven",596,602],["boisterous",611,621],["disturbed",622,631],["strike",697,703],["cloud",798,803],["blow",1402,1406]],"events":[],"dates":[["the months of December, January,",155,187],["March",197,202],["April",208,213],["the ear",704,711],["May",1511,1514],["14",1709,1711],["12",1835,1837]],"times":[],"distances":[["five miles",1128,1138]],"loc_advs":[["there",947,952]],"spa_preps":[["under",761,766],["within",1121,1127]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0122699387,"vader_sentiment":0.91,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983133078}]
