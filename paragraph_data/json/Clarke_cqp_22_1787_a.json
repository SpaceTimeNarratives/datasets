It generally affords some degree of amusement, to those who possess an extensive acquaintance with general history, to observe the minute causes from whence important events have so often derived their origin. For if trifles often affect the minds of the greatest men, and of the greatest multitudes; the first by their situation, and the latter by their bulk, occasion those affairs in the world which we characterize by the name of Important; whilst, in the greatness of their effects, their insignificant original causes are generally forgotten. Yet every investigating faculty of the human mind is interested, when an opportunity offers of deducing, by a direct channel, large and extensive consequents, from a combination of circumstances, either overlooked because they are common, or slighted because they are trivial; but such as, when united and urged in a particular direction, thrust themselves abroad into the world, and become of consequence to mankind: even when no such direct channel of inquiry offers itself, we are apt enough to be pleased, if, by comparison and analogy, we can draw such inferences as Curiosity at least may warrant, and Reason not disavow.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["channel",669,676],["common",783,789],["channel",995,1002]],"pos_words":[["important",160,169],["greatest",258,266],["greatest",283,291],["greatness",463,472],["enough",1040,1046],["pleased",1053,1060]],"neg_words":[["insignificant",497,510],["trivial",820,827],["disavow",1171,1178]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["the minute",130,140]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["abroad",909,915]],"spa_preps":[["into",916,920]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0319148936,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9939957261},{"para_id":11,"paragraph":"Ii.

To say positively for what particular reason the people of different countries have adopted this or that custom, will always be beyond the reach of the keenest speculation. some, it is likely, nature hath originally given to all; others, climate and circumstances may have engrafted: but the greatest part must be referred to that complex and obscure variety of intervening causes, to which, because we cannot develope their particular relation, nor trace them through their intricate mazes, we have affixed the general epithet of Chance. These again, in a sort of permutation, have produced an infinite number of distinctions, of which local history can only take in a part at a time: however, in every country some particular things may be found, which on comparison appear similar to those of another; yet are of such a kind, that they cannot easily be attributed to nature or climate alone, but bear the marks of a commerce and interchange, that has some time subsisted, either directly, or by the mediation of others. If\" I will throw a stone upon your cairn,\" was an expression of friendship amongst our forefathers, we, of course, refer it to their scythian ancestors; yet these tumuli, which we call Cairns and Barrows, are found to have been in old times amongst the Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans; and indeed what else are the Egyptian pyramids? But who would have thought that these same cairns or barrows, and this same custom, should have existed beyond the utmost eastern limits of Asia, in the barren island of Oonalashka? Again: The crisping, perfuming, and powdering of hair, are things which have been in former ages as well as this; yet one rather startles at hearing that they are common to unknown savages on the opposite side of the world, and beyond the southern tropic. Painting seems, by all wild nations, to have been first applied to their own bodies; and it is hard to determine, that the custom has not crept down, through all the different stages of civilization, from those times to our own. That the component parts of dead bodies should be united at a certain period, and become immortal, was a tenet amongst the Greeks, as well as amongst Jews and Christians. The belief of a chaos, of a rebellion in Heaven, of a general deluge, and of several other things, have been common to religions vastly remote from each other. There is a strong resemblance between the stories of Joseph and Bellerophon, of Jeptha and Idomeneus. The funeral howl has been raised in almost every quarter of the earth, and human supersstition has always had its fausti and nefausti dies. Many English words, with their native meaning attached to them, have migrated into Calabria and Apulia; yet we know not whether they were introduced along with English sheep, or at some other time. These things, without doubt, and many more that might be instanced, originate from causes which have not been of sufficient importance for the notice of general history; or they have crept on in a silent progression; or have been transported by casualties, the authentic story of which is either lost or obscured by time: yet some of them furnish powerful arguments for the existence of obsolete arrangements, and unrecorded intercourse. It is here that local attempts to supply the void in general history take place, and present resemblances, which may stimulate curiosity to investigate, if possible, their causes.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["countries",74,83],["country",709,716],["stone",1047,1052],["island",1518,1524],["common",1703,1709],["common",2305,2311]],"pos_words":[["positively",12,22],["greatest",297,305],["variety",356,363],["intricate",480,489],["well",1640,1644],["well",2159,2163],["strong",2367,2373],["sufficient",2909,2919],["silent",2993,2999],["authentic",3057,3066],["powerful",3143,3151],["stimulate",3351,3360]],"neg_words":[["complex",336,343],["obscure",348,355],["limits",1488,1494],["barren",1511,1517],["unknown",1713,1720],["savages",1721,1728],["wild",1819,1823],["hard",1891,1895],["crept",1934,1939],["dead",2053,2057],["chaos",2212,2217],["deluge",2258,2264],["dies",2592,2596],["doubt",2818,2823],["crept",2979,2984],["lost",3092,3096],["obscured",3100,3108],["obsolete",3183,3191]],"events":[],"dates":[["almost every quarter",2494,2514]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["opposite",1736,1744],["without",2810,2817],["here",3240,3244]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",133,139],["through",466,473],["amongst",1103,1110],["amongst",1269,1276],["beyond",1462,1468],["beyond",1768,1774],["down",1940,1944],["through",1946,1953],["amongst",2136,2143],["amongst",2167,2174],["between",2386,2393],["into",2676,2680],["along",2747,2752]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0215827338,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9969546795},{"para_id":13,"paragraph":"Iv. That languages radically the same, even in the latter ages of the world, should assume altered tones and idioms, far alienated from their original ones, does not seem wonderful, when one recollects the number of promiscuous tongues with which force and other contingencies have blended them; it seems to me rather more wonderful, that modern refinement, and the laboured improvements of grammarians, have not almost erazed every trace of affinity. A language, when once settled with classic precision, will of course leave out such a number of the current phrases, and words of particular districts, as are proportional to the difference between the dialects of those districts and of the men who compiled the standard tongue: some, besides, will be lost by forgetfulness, and others overlooked on account of their vulgarity. In process of time these excluded words and phrases grow more and more estranged, become at last a barbarism, and are forgotten. Yet it is not perhaps unworthy of a thinking mind to observe, how other tongues of the same stock still retain, in their purest state, many of those things which are exiled into the more barbarous and remote dialects of another; or in what manner expressions, though occasionally changed in termination,&amp; c. mingle familiarly with the current of one mode of speech, when they have lost all connection with each other. There are few dialects which have not something distinct and peculiar to themselves; either in single words, particular phrases, or the general structure of their sentences; and when such a dialect as one of these has no standard of its own, that is, before civilization and learning have given it uniformity, every one that writes will write the words he is accustomed to, and in the stile which use has taught him. Again: Where there is no great seminary to produce scholars, who may dignify and fix their native idiom by their writings; an idiom, formed on some more fashionable plans, and established by some eminent performances, will be sought; it will become the language of scholars, and learning in time must not deviate from it. Yet as every county in England, though the radicals of its language be common, and its speech in general conformable to that of the rest, uses many phrases notwithstanding which are peculiar to itself; we may naturally infer, from the variety of nations who have inhabited this island, that it was always so; and that the standard tongue, which is a sort of mixture of the whole, left out many words as needless, because supplied by other dialects, and rejected many more on account of their vulgarity. Therefore, if any particular place has, by its cultivation of letters, or by its authority, established the superiority of its own dialect; that dialect, as it advances in refinement, will gradually become fastidious, and reject or forget many of its own homely phrases which it had in common with others of the same stock, and assume those of languages which circumstances have rendered still more learned or fashionable. Few will hesitate in calling this an emendation; yet such emendation will make the distinction still more obvious, as it must of course leave out many of those expressions which it once used in common with its kindred dialects, and which rusticity and solitude have in the mean time secured from any material alteration: for from whatever cause languages originate, without books as a fixed point to which they may recur, they will always in general intercourse be vague and fluctuating.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",2143,2150]],"geonouns":[["force",247,252],["districts",593,602],["districts",672,681],["county",2133,2139],["common",2191,2197],["island",2398,2404],["common",2909,2915],["common",3240,3246],["point",3437,3442]],"pos_words":[["wonderful",171,180],["wonderful",323,332],["modern",339,345],["refinement",346,356],["improvements",375,387],["affinity",442,450],["classic",487,494],["great",1823,1828],["dignify",1867,1874],["fashionable",1951,1962],["eminent",1994,2001],["variety",2355,2362],["superiority",2731,2742],["refinement",2795,2805],["fashionable",3033,3044],["distinction",3129,3140]],"neg_words":[["radically",19,28],["alienated",121,130],["lost",754,758],["forgetfulness",762,775],["estranged",901,910],["unworthy",981,989],["barbarous",1146,1155],["lost",1344,1348],["peculiar",1442,1450],["deviate",2103,2110],["radicals",2163,2171],["peculiar",2302,2310],["needless",2523,2531],["rejected",2573,2581],["fastidious",2829,2839],["reject",2845,2851],["vague",3511,3516]],"events":[],"dates":[["the latter ages",47,62]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1811,1816],["left",2500,2504],["without",3412,3419]],"spa_preps":[["out",527,530],["between",642,649],["into",1132,1136],["out",2505,2508],["out",3188,3191]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.003649635,"vader_sentiment":-0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9909690022},{"para_id":14,"paragraph":"V. That irregular, but mischievous kind of war, which is called Incursive, cannot well subsist but amongst those who reside in territories contiguous to the boundaries of two hostile or rival states. Its requisite is Expedition, and its object Plunder. The disturbance of wars, like the boiling of a caldron, hath a sort of scum. Troublesome tempers, incapable of rest, and fond of rapine through native avarice or inveterate habits; these tempers, when jealousy makes nations under the masque of peace ill at ease with each other, or when civil administration is held with a lax hand, or again when the governors of the outside provinces, from private interests or pique, connive at their practices, will too often receive a tacit encouragement. But add to these, even in better times, the advantages of night, secrecy, and by-ways; the obstacles to regular judicial inquiry, from difference of laws under different governments; the patronage and protection of their immediate lords, of relations and neighbours; together with the force of example handed down from father to son for many generations; and we need not wonder, if such a disease acquired no small degree of virulence. There may, however, be still more reasons assigned; for when such a people are uncertain to which government they belong, or are continually changing their masters, they are willing enough to think they belong to neither, may make incursions on both, or fight out their own quarrels amongst themselves, without imagining that they are accountable to any one. Besides, individuals of this cast are too apt, when their fortunes are desperate, to forget that they have any native country at all, and to consider every thing as lawful game; or even, from a custom so long nourished in the lap of barbarity, may never dream that such actions are criminal, and perhaps consider them as requisites of life. Moreover, when wrenched by force from one party, or surrendered with a grudge, their practices may be abetted by that party as the hopes of a war, and the means of recovery. There might, without doubt, were we more intimately acquainted with circumstances, be many more causes adduced to confirm the likeliness of a durable and extensive effect attached to such a life; but these which are already mentioned, and for which there is undoubted authority with respect to their application in the present purpose, are sufficient to persuade any one that they were enough to produce certain effects, which would add new horror and cruelty to themselves; namely, old wrongs to avenge, and hereditary antipathies to gratify. But it ought not to be forgot, that such men, by their continual acquaintance with danger, and their knowledge of the country; by their hardiness, subtlety, and swiftness, would be excellent attendants on more regular armies; they would be well qualified for partisans, foragers and spies; and from thence might receive additional encouragement; nay, we know that the bulk of many armies has consisted of them: they will be, without doubt, extremely fierce and cruel; for with war a certain degree of barbarity will creep into mankind; but habitual war, and incessant violence must ensavage them strangely: History uniformly ascribes principles like these to a wild people, and generally finds them wild in a situation like this of which we are speaking.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["force",1032,1037],["country",1660,1667],["force",1910,1915],["country",2719,2726]],"pos_words":[["well",82,86],["like",278,282],["fond",374,378],["peace",497,502],["ease",510,514],["interests",653,662],["encouragement",732,745],["better",773,779],["advantages",791,801],["protection",948,958],["wonder",1118,1124],["masters",1339,1346],["willing",1357,1364],["enough",1365,1371],["lawful",1707,1713],["recovery",2047,2055],["durable",2199,2206],["respect",2340,2347],["sufficient",2397,2407],["enough",2443,2449],["gratify",2592,2599],["swiftness",2762,2771],["excellent",2782,2791],["well",2841,2845],["qualified",2846,2855],["encouragement",2932,2945],["like",3246,3250],["like",3320,3324]],"neg_words":[["irregular",8,17],["mischievous",23,34],["hostile",175,182],["rival",186,191],["object",237,243],["disturbance",257,268],["boiling",287,294],["scum",324,328],["incapable",351,360],["avarice",404,411],["jealousy",454,462],["pique",666,671],["virulence",1172,1181],["uncertain",1262,1271],["quarrels",1457,1465],["desperate",1613,1622],["barbarity",1775,1784],["criminal",1824,1832],["grudge",1954,1960],["doubt",2078,2083],["cruelty",2509,2516],["avenge",2554,2560],["danger",2684,2690],["partisans",2860,2869],["doubt",3034,3039],["fierce",3051,3057],["cruel",3062,3067],["barbarity",3102,3111],["creep",3117,3122],["incessant",3159,3168],["strangely",3197,3206],["wild",3262,3266],["wild",3300,3304]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["night",805,810]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",1486,1493],["without",2070,2077],["there",2306,2311],["without",3026,3033]],"spa_preps":[["amongst",99,106],["through",389,396],["under",477,482],["outside",621,628],["under",901,906],["together",1014,1022],["down",1056,1060],["out",1443,1446],["amongst",1466,1473],["into",3123,3127]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0178571429,"vader_sentiment":-0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9947496057},{"para_id":15,"paragraph":"Vi. When a country is exposed to continual invasions from a neighbouring enemy, its means of defence will be proportionally numerous. A regular government generally establishes a chain of forts, or of military stations, for its defence; or, as the Chinese have done, and as the Romans did in more places than one, builds a barrier still more continuous to exclude the invaders. But in the half - anarchy of the feudal system, every petty lord had his castle to defend his domain and his own hoard, independent of those that were maintained at the public charge. One mode had in view the security of a whole province; the other, whilst it weakened the first, more immediately regarded the property of individuals. One expects, in the first case, numerous encampments, fortresses, and military stations; in the latter, that when the defence of the inhabitants is left in a great measure to themselves, every house will be as strong as the owner can afford to make it, or will be built on an eminence for the sake of a good look-out; but, if neither of these can be accomplished, will be in the vicinity of some strong place, to which its inhabitants may withdraw for shelter. Again: When a detached kingdom retains its independence long after those contiguous to it; its manners and religious rites, when those of the others are abolished, or changed by the intrusion of strangers, we expect it should retain proportionally fresher marks of its former condition.

Where painting goes, there generally goes poetry; their walks are the same; their beloved scenes are similar, and have always been so from the Grecian tempe, to the green glens of Britain.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Britain",887,894]],"geonouns":[["mountains",233,242],["trees",282,287],["streams",307,314],["water",318,323],["stations",543,551],["glens",878,883]],"pos_words":[["richness",141,149],["variety",162,169],["gratified",195,204],["rich",266,270],["magic",420,425],["powerfully",641,651],["beloved",789,796]],"neg_words":[["irregular",60,69],["scarce",507,513],["strike",625,631]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",728,733]],"spa_preps":[["within",453,459]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0512820513,"vader_sentiment":0.92,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987716079},{"para_id":17,"paragraph":"Viii.

What dreadful havock was occasioned in England by a casual amour, and subsequent marriage of Edward Iv.! Affairs purely domestic made Henry Viii. shake off the Pope's supremacy; and a ludicrous present of a few tennis-balls is said not a little to have exasperated that great contest for empire between the kings of France and England. The finest library in the world owed its destruction to the Alexandrine war, which took its rise from an amorous interview between Caesar and Cleopatra; and the pitiful logic of an Arabian zealot destroyed another. But instances of such events are numberless, nor are those fewer the execution of which depend upon multitudes. Thus the over-forwardness and wantonness of a tax-gatherer caused that mighty insurrection of the Kentish Commons which disturbed the reign of Richard Ii.; and the steadiness of a poor, old, insignificant priest, first gave consistency to the Reformation in scotland. The confinement of a few gladiators gave being to troubles which challenged the strength of the Roman Legions; and these outrages in Judea, which did not terminate but in the almost entire extinction of the Jewish name, are generally referred to the dismission of some workmen from the building of the last Temple. I forbear further instances; and shall only ask, To what more important cause can we ascribe those religious quarrels with which almost the whole world has at times been disturbed? Whoever considers the vanity, or superstition, or other weaknesses incident to the most eminent men, will not wonder at such things as strange, any more than that the falling of an apple should suggest to the comprehensive soul of Newton, the idea of that great principle which regulates all nature. Though these same weaknesses in the minds of the multitude may perhaps operate with a greater force, there generally are found some more remote, or perhaps collateral incidents, necessary to give them effect; of which we might bring illustrations: but I am afraid that this digression is already too long; I only meant it as an argument of my more immediate subject, to which I therefore return.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["France",1046,1052],["England",1142,1149],["France",1419,1425],["England",1430,1437],["Newton",2761,2767]],"geonouns":[["stations",952,960],["building",2320,2328],["force",2924,2929]],"pos_words":[["respect",8,15],["better",58,64],["great",178,183],["desirous",274,282],["affirm",409,415],["sufficient",457,467],["well",659,663],["great",759,764],["proper",809,815],["eminent",944,951],["supremacy",1270,1279],["great",1373,1378],["finest",1443,1449],["mighty",1837,1843],["steadiness",1930,1940],["important",2411,2420],["eminent",2618,2625],["wonder",2640,2646],["comprehensive",2739,2752],["great",2786,2791]],"neg_words":[["vanity",228,234],["terrible",355,363],["petty",594,599],["hated",1080,1085],["dreadful",1108,1116],["shake",1249,1254],["ludicrous",1287,1296],["exasperated",1356,1367],["destruction",1480,1491],["pitiful",1600,1607],["zealot",1628,1634],["insurrection",1844,1856],["disturbed",1886,1895],["poor",1946,1950],["insignificant",1957,1970],["troubles",2084,2092],["outrages",2155,2163],["quarrels",2458,2466],["disturbed",2519,2528],["vanity",2552,2558],["superstition",2563,2575],["weaknesses",2586,2596],["strange",2665,2672],["falling",2697,2704],["weaknesses",2848,2858],["afraid",3087,3093]],"events":[],"dates":[["Ii.",1917,1920]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",2931,2936]],"spa_preps":[["between",189,196],["out",671,674],["between",1398,1405],["between",1562,1569],["over",1775,1779]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0217391304,"vader_sentiment":-0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9945741296},{"para_id":20,"paragraph":"The disturbances on the borders of England and scotland have frequently been the plea, and sometimes the cause of most serious affairs; yet these disturbances,( such was the temper of the people,) were begun, and continually fostered by the most unaccountable trifles. If they met at a fair, or a merry-making, some or other of them got engaged in a quarrel; each party had numerous favourers and abettors, and thus the contest became general: it was carried home by every individual, and they only came back to revenge it. Thus mutual insults and injuries made mutual complaints and justifications necessary; these delayed the cure, and this delay was not a little increased by the strange nature of the laws which prevailed in those districts: the mischief, in consequence, received continual increase, till it became of a size for general history. In the year 1369, a fair was held at Roxburgh during a peace between the two nations: at this fair a quarrel arose amongst the Borderers, as was generally the case, and a scotsman, servant to the Earl of March, was killed. Amongst the customs, and even laws of these strange people, a certain atonement for blood was one; and this atonement not being made on the present occasion, his master took up the quarrel, in which he was assisted by the Gordon and others. These began to ravage the opposite marches in a terrible manner, and of course called forth the Wardens of those marches, sir John silburn, and the Piercy, to repel the invasion, and to take vengeance by similar means. Thus the confines at large of both kingdoms, and the counties adjoining, became in a great measure a scene of desolation; and considerable numbers of men perished, in several rough encounters, during its continuance. Again: In the year 1377, another fair was held at Roxburgh, which was terminated by a similar quarrel, in which the town itself was burnt. To revenge this, the Piercy, now Earl of Northumberland, entered scotland with an army, which is said to have consisted of ten thousand men, and for three days ravaged the lands of the Earl of March. Hunting parties, besides, were productive of frequent outrages. I do not mean such parties as were made sometimes in open defiance by the turbulent and powerful chieftains of the north; but the poaching companies, who seldom or never desired a fair field, nor were prepared for much opposition. It is somewhat singular, that though, in times of peace, people of the one march were seldom hindred, upon asking leave, to hunt in the waste grounds of the other; yet the humor was such, as very seldom to use any such friendly application. Hence, the hunters were generally driven home again, and punished, according to the spirit of the times, by a few robberies, slaughters, and burnings within their own boundaries. Thus was a war begun, which spread, sometimes more, and sometimes less, into the neighbouring kingdoms; but, for the most part, found an ample supply amongst the irascible tempers in its neighbourhood. History takes notice of some of these: but without making many quotations, it may suffice to remember, that in the time of profound peace a real Chevy Chace would have been acted in the reign of James I. but for the intervention of some persons of authority and moderation. A few hunters appeared upon the West Marches of England: they were expostulated with; and refusing to return, both parties were gathering their strength to an effectual determination. But I know not that any thing has furnished so many incitements to mischief as the matches at foot-balls which used to be played in these parts, province against province. The custom is not yet obsolete; and within these last sixty years, though at that time the animosity, rivalry, and consequently the numbers of its attendants were much diminished, yet it was still played with great violence, and by several hundreds on a side. When men are heated with such exercise, and half angry with the rebuffs of the game, it is inconceivable what disturbance and uproar the quarrel of two persons can produce, even amongst friends and neighbours; but much greater must the damage have been amongst men inflamed by the animosity of ages. I have heard many traditional stories, which still remembered the tragedies to which these matches, as well as the hunting parties, had given birth; and in the neighbourhood of the Liddle, Esk, and Leven, they may still be heard. But Dr Burn, in his history of Cumberland and Westmoreland, gives a regular account of one, wherein, though they fought only with clubs and stakes, yet a considerable number of men were killed. These matches, like other pastimes, were held on sundays, or some other holy days, and by a strong similarity of circumstances present a striking picture of the solemn times and barbarous feasts of savages. Now it is impossible but such proceedings must draw the notice of the legislative authority of the country; but then the judges of such affairs were men of the same stamp with those who committed them: for the most part, they wanted little or no incitement to head and enforce the quarrel of their vassals and dependents. It was then that the consequences of these baubles became more or less noticed by real history; and afforded, as I said before, sometimes a cause, and often a plea to great and national wars.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",35,42],["Northumberland",1931,1945],["England",3329,3336],["Leven",4395,4400],["Cumberland",4458,4468],["Westmoreland",4473,4485]],"geonouns":[["districts",735,744],["town",1867,1871],["lands",2062,2067],["field",2339,2344],["grounds",2527,2534],["foot",3559,3563],["country",4927,4934],["head",5088,5092]],"pos_words":[["fair",286,290],["merry",297,302],["cure",628,632],["fair",871,875],["peace",906,911],["fair",945,949],["master",1236,1242],["great",1619,1624],["fair",1784,1788],["productive",2121,2131],["powerful",2242,2250],["fair",2334,2338],["peace",2435,2440],["humor",2557,2562],["friendly",2604,2612],["ample",2942,2947],["suffice",3089,3096],["profound",3130,3138],["peace",3139,3144],["effectual",3440,3449],["great",3846,3851],["well",4300,4304],["like",4636,4640],["holy",4693,4697],["strong",4713,4719],["striking",4758,4766],["great",5317,5322]],"neg_words":[["plea",81,85],["temper",174,180],["quarrel",350,357],["revenge",512,519],["insults",536,543],["complaints",569,579],["delayed",616,623],["delay",643,648],["strange",683,690],["mischief",750,758],["quarrel",952,959],["killed",1066,1072],["strange",1118,1125],["quarrel",1255,1262],["ravage",1330,1336],["terrible",1363,1371],["repel",1474,1479],["vengeance",1506,1515],["desolation",1644,1654],["rough",1709,1714],["quarrel",1845,1852],["revenge",1893,1900],["outrages",2144,2152],["defiance",2212,2220],["turbulent",2228,2237],["opposition",2373,2383],["waste",2521,2526],["irascible",2967,2976],["refusing",3371,3379],["mischief",3532,3540],["obsolete",3659,3667],["animosity",3728,3737],["rivalry",3739,3746],["angry",3946,3951],["inconceivable",3988,4001],["disturbance",4007,4018],["uproar",4023,4029],["quarrel",4034,4041],["damage",4133,4139],["animosity",4178,4187],["killed",4613,4619],["solemn",4782,4788],["barbarous",4799,4808],["savages",4819,4826],["impossible",4838,4848],["incitement",5074,5084],["quarrel",5109,5116],["plea",5309,5313]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year 1369",854,867],["March",1055,1060],["the year 1377",1761,1774],["three days",2039,2049],["March",2083,2088],["march",2460,2465],["these last sixty years",3680,3702],["days",4698,4702]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["home",459,463],["opposite",1341,1349],["home",2667,2671],["without",3050,3057],["within",3673,3679]],"spa_preps":[["between",912,919],["amongst",966,973],["within",2776,2782],["into",2877,2881],["amongst",2955,2962],["against",3619,3626],["amongst",4075,4082],["amongst",4150,4157]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0461538462,"vader_sentiment":-0.56,"roberta_sentiment":0.9820581079},{"para_id":21,"paragraph":"The almost uniform train of circumstances which affected these countries from their border situation, and the little difference there was between one of the dark ages and another, strongly induce me to believe, that the Northern people were little altered in manners from very remote times, to those immediately preceding the reign of Queen Elizabeth; and the subject which I have been treating upon tempts me to relate one story, as an exemplification of it.

Whatever effect political regulations might have had in preserving this superiority, or whatever the consequent practice of it as an amusement may have done, I think I may safely aver, that the custom of poaching occasioned by the severity of the game-laws established by the conqueror, had no small effect in preserving it. It was this that produced so many noted archers and outlaws in the forest of Englewood as well as that of sherwood. For, not to mention Adam Bell and his partners, tradition still preserves the names of Watty of Croglin, Woodhead Andrew, Robin Oth' moors, Gruff Elleck( Alexander,) and of several others, as of persons distinguished in that line, even amongst a people who were almost to a man of the same stamp. Besides, as their squabbles and the subsequent marodings made the skill thus acquired at times absolutely necessary to the inhabitants on each side of the boundary, we may easily conclude, that a necessity of this kind, continually kept alive, must produce no small degree of dexterity. In addition to the motives which might induce the inferior countries of England to exercise themselves in archery, in the borders, was self-defence, and the provision of sustenance: two motives always powerful, and in those parts unremittingly urgent. Thus the trifles which continued its use, and the trifles which made that use needful, when combined together, and directed by particular contingencies, affected, by their number and collected force, the history of the times in a very distinguished manner. Whoever will consider the circumstances of the battles which were then fought, will find, that wherever the ground or circumstances favoured the archers for a number of regular discharges, they generally produced such a confusion, particularly amongst the enemy's horse, as gave the men at arms of their own party an opportunity of easily compleating it. I need cite no further particulars of this than the battle of Homeldon, when the forces of the Northern Marches encountered the gallant Archibald Earl of Douglas; the men at arms stood still that day, and the bowmen had the whole business upon their hands. It is recorded, that no armour could resist their arrows, though that of Earl Douglas and his associates had been three years in making.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Bell",742,746],["Croglin",813,820],["England",1373,1380]],"geonouns":[["forest",668,674],["moors",850,855],["line",942,946],["countries",1360,1369],["force",1746,1751],["ground",1918,1924],["forces",2246,2252]],"pos_words":[["superiority",58,69],["superiority",348,359],["safely",448,454],["aver",455,459],["well",691,695],["distinguished",920,933],["skill",1080,1085],["powerful",1502,1510],["distinguished",1788,1801],["gallant",2293,2300]],"neg_words":[["severity",507,515],["inferior",1351,1359],["urgent",1545,1551],["confusion",2030,2039],["enemy",2066,2071]],"events":[],"dates":[["that day",2356,2364],["three years",2536,2547]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["without",28,35]],"spa_preps":[["against",214,221],["amongst",953,960],["together",1654,1662],["amongst",2054,2061]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0229357798,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9966142774},{"para_id":25,"paragraph":"It would seem indeed( by the bye) that the scots excelled in the use of the spear, and( excepting the Borderers) neglected the bow; since one of their own Kings is thought to have recommended its more general use, by ridiculing their imperfect management of it.

From what motive it is I know not, except it is from the prejudices of habit, that persons, who have been accustomed to a wandering unsettled life, and such as cultivation would pronounce unhappy, reject the conveniences of regular life with wonderful perseverance; but gypsies and vagrants furnish daily and indisputable proofs of its being so. Their fondness for continual migration seems to have been sucked in with their mother's milk; and one would think, that they found amongst the comforts of society, certain restraints, which it not only irked them to bear, but which far overbalanced all its benefits. surely there is in the mind of man a strange longing for freedom; and when custom, sometimes stronger than nature, accords with it, their united efforts must be very powerful. The Isaurians were a small nation in the heart of the Roman empire; they dwelt amongst mountains; they saw civilization on every side, yet they rejected it with scorn; and, on occasions, found employment for the Legions through the course of several ages. The Eskimaux returns with glee from our luxuries to his native desarts, and to feed on train-oil, or stinking blubber. The Indians, who have been educated in the schools of North America, revolt to the barbarism of their fathers. The swiss, when in the service of foreign states, have many of them died of a longing to revisit the mountains where they spent their infancy; and the disorder has acquired, as it justly merited, a name of its own. And thus the vagrant, who perhaps never slept in a cradle, yearns for a windy barn and a bed of straw, instead of our boasted conveniences; which, whilst custom had made grateful to us, it hath made uneasy shackles to him. It is silly to blame those prejudices in others which can retort so easily upon our own: besides, every single man hath some humor or other, which, though grateful to him, may be the reverse to another: and this makes me oft think, that no one should wonder at prejudices, till he has first tried to give their cause a fair investigation.

Yet nothing of the kind ever got a footing here: the lust of roving and plunder supplanted every thing else, and was so continual and uninterrupted, as to resemble instinct. To their very meetings of merriment they came armed; and frequently gave fresh ardour, by new quarrels, to former animosities, even when they met purposely for a treaty of peace. That they might be more invisible during their outrodes, and consequently less liable to the effects of their enemies' vigilance, the colour of their cloathes resembled that of the scenes of their employment, or of their season of action, that is, of a brown heath and a cloudy evening. No knowledge conferred honour here, but that of the art of plundering; viz. of intricate byways, of perplexed passages in swamps and moors, and of the bow. Thus, examples of what might condemn their conduct were never offered to them, and immemorial custom seemed, as it were, to sanctify their wildness. Every Border Man almost, without exception, was brought up in a state which we would call unhappy, and every circumstance of his life tended to confirm his partiality for an uncertain bed, and unprovided diet. Danger was his companion from his infancy, and would of course debar him of the knowledge of many conveniences of settled life, yet at the same time suggest modes of convenience and habits of amusement, which it would require either real experience or long observation to be able to form an idea of. For what conception have we of things which use has not engrafted? Thus a Border Man could not want those adscititious conveniences which he never knew, though we cannot do without them. He had seen nothing of human affairs where there was not toil and hazard; therefore toil and hazard became, of course, to be considered as the necessary contingents of existence, were most intimately blended with it, and could not be detached from it: besides, every boy of spirit wishes to be a man, and to be a man in those times and places was to watch his own, and plunder others. Injuries may be forgot, quarrels obliterated, and prejudices rooted out, in the course of a man's life; but this fondness for roving, when it has once got hold, is, if my private observation has not been strangely misguided, the most obstinate of all prepossessions and attachments. I shall therefore call it the leading spirit of the Moss Troopers of both Marches. Without doubt, it received, as I said before, occasional aid from circumstances, and was accompanied by other passions, the antecedents, co-temporaries, or consequents of itself, which had a drift to the same end; but itself was the ruling and most constant principle. That I may not be thought to assign the foregoing character rashly, and without authority, I shall subjoin a few circumstances relative to their temper, out of very many that may be found; and try to give an idea of the men whom a continual acquaintance with danger had trained so far as to sport with it.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",67,74]],"geonouns":[["moors",1084,1089],["bed",1440,1443]],"pos_words":[["superior",162,170],["steady",291,297],["merriment",511,520],["fresh",558,563],["peace",657,662],["vigilance",783,792],["intricate",1030,1039],["convenience",1632,1643],["fondness",2451,2459],["leading",2651,2658]],"neg_words":[["plunder",383,390],["quarrels",579,587],["invisible",688,697],["liable",743,749],["enemies",774,781],["cloudy",935,941],["perplexed",1051,1060],["condemn",1136,1143],["unhappy",1346,1353],["partiality",1412,1422],["uncertain",1430,1439],["toil",2010,2014],["hazard",2019,2025],["toil",2037,2041],["hazard",2046,2052],["plunder",2322,2329],["quarrels",2362,2370],["obliterated",2371,2382],["prejudices",2388,2398],["strangely",2542,2551],["misguided",2552,2561],["obstinate",2572,2581],["doubt",2712,2717],["temper",3118,3124],["danger",3232,3238]],"events":[],"dates":[["season",885,891]],"times":[["evening",942,949]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",354,358],["here",981,985],["without",1281,1288],["without",1939,1946],["there",1996,2001],["without",3045,3052]],"spa_preps":[["out",2406,2409],["out",3126,3129]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0553505535,"vader_sentiment":-0.82,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9971287847},{"para_id":30,"paragraph":"seven desperadoes of the Marches, without any motive that we know of, but their natural restlessness, and desperate love of plunder and violence, broke into and seized upon the castle of Berwick, killed sir Robert Boynton the governor, but dismissed his family, on condition that they should either pay 2000 Merks for their ransom, or return again.

But the same motive which prevents me from quoting any more of the anecdotes, viz. the fear of being tedious in the recital of things which may easily be seen elsewhere, prevents me also from being any way particular about these; as they may be heard from many persons in the borders, and as some of them are, I believe, printed. In that of Jock-o' - the-side we have a specimen of their method of scaling walls, of their custom of ransoming prisoners with cattle, of the refuge which one side of the boundary afforded to the rascals of the other, of the spirit of their jests, and of their subtlety. In that of Hobby Noble, who is mentioned in the former song as one of those rascals who had been banished from Bewcastle, his native place, for his crimes, we see their treachery from Hobby's catastrophe, and the desperate resolution that was so frequent amongst them, from his whole conduct. But we see, most particularly, of what matchless estimation amongst them was an accurate knowledge of the secret and almost inexplicable byways through moors and swamps. There is another song also in these parts of Dick-o' - the-Cow, whom I cannot help suspecting to be the same with that Richard Coldall whose monumental inscription remains in Penrith Church, and who was called by the country people Dicky Cow. With this name the women used to make their children quiet not very long ago, as they did for a long space of time in France with the name of Talbot. However this be, the song of Dick-o' - the-Cow exhibits a strong instance of the encouragement which the petty irregularities of individuals received from the connivance of their superiors, as well as of the uncommon boldness, dexterity, and cunning, which those individuals possessed. Again: One may form a notion of their irascibility and proneness to mischief from\" the Battle of Red Swire,\" begun by the men of Tindale; and of their diversions and amusements, from many songs of either Border. It is needless to make mention in this place of those which Dr Piercy and others have published: only I must beg leave to take notice here of part of a passage which the Doctor in his preface to the\" Battle of Otterburne\" quotes from Froissart, as immediately applicable to my purpose.

Indeed shakespear seems to allude to this humor, in one of Falstaff's speeches concerning Hotspur. And I hold it to be no small argument of the authenticity of the relations which the border-songs contain, as well as of the genuiness of their descriptions of manners, that they are uniformly impregnated with this spirit, and frequently tinctured with a something of the ludicrous, that serves to shew in what manner they reasoned with danger.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Penrith",1795,1802],["France",1981,1987]],"geonouns":[["walls",962,967],["moors",1602,1607],["country",1837,1844]],"pos_words":[["genuine",111,118],["matchless",1489,1498],["accurate",1530,1538],["monumental",1761,1771],["quiet",1916,1921],["strong",2071,2077],["encouragement",2094,2107],["well",2206,2210],["well",2928,2932],["congratulation",2980,2994],["thank",3004,3009],["grateful",3037,3045],["engaging",3097,3105],["humor",3178,3183],["well",3345,3349],["reasoned",3558,3566]],"neg_words":[["obscurity",292,301],["fear",643,647],["tedious",657,664],["rascals",1082,1089],["rascals",1233,1240],["treachery",1326,1335],["catastrophe",1349,1360],["desperate",1370,1379],["petty",2118,2123],["mischief",2367,2375],["needless",2517,2525],["beg",2620,2623],["fury",2840,2844],["enemies",3055,3062],["ludicrous",3507,3516],["danger",3572,3578]],"events":[],"dates":[["this day",350,358],["the\"",2706,2710]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["elsewhere",715,724],["here",2645,2649],["there",2804,2809]],"spa_preps":[["about",773,778],["amongst",1412,1419],["amongst",1510,1517],["through",1594,1601]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":0.9984852672},{"para_id":37,"paragraph":"It may not be improper, in this place, to mention the medley of nations who were settled in Britain, and who may be proved not to have entirely coalesced, or been blended together in these parts, so late as the days of Hubert the Vallibus of Gilsland, from a deed of his, addressed to all Cumbrians, Frenchmen, Aliens, Danes, and Normans. Yet it does not seem that any of these people brought a regular code of laws along with them; or if they did, these laws were either never received, or were soon lost and swallowed up in the prevalent humor: for we find after that, the Commissioners appointed to settle the peace of the Marches by fixed and established ordinances, collecting these ordinances from the traditional accounts of ancient usages, that had been sanctified as laws by the length of time which they had endured. And as these usages were different from most others, nay, almost peculiar to the men to whom they belonged, it is natural to infer that the laws built upon them must be singular: for the Commissioners, well aware of the impracticability of imposing new laws upon such people, contented themselves with endeavouring to restrain them, by giving authority to those ordinances by which they had endeavoured, from immemorial times, though in vain, to regulate themselves. It must be allowed, that since the mischiefs could not be totally erazed by any regulations of government, that such an establishment of customs promised as fair for this purpose as any thing: as the customs were originally conformable to their own disposition, perfectly known to them, and more especially as from the foregoing circumstances.

No one but a scotsman could be admitted as an evidence against a scotsman, nor any one but an Englishman against an Englishman. This was surely a very fortunate law for thieves, and more especially for those of the debateable ground; who, from their situation, could be of either nation, or of neither, as they pleased. This law, however, could only extend to particular matters; since there is another in Nicholson's collection, expressly declaring, that no inhabitant of either kingdom, could, by means of witnesses, prove his property in any thing possessed by an inhabitant of the other; for such proof could only be made by the body of a man, that is by combat; and so numerous were the causes of litigation, that these combats ensued continually. The Marches, moreover, were the places where all such trials, whether for murder or theft, were to take place between the inhabitants of the two kingdoms; and no man accused of these, or any other crime that ought to be tried by single combat, was bound to answer for them elsewhere. For this reason, there were particular places fixed upon and set apart for that purpose; and to those places might all men, betwixt Tolness in England and Caithness in scotland, excepting the two Kings and certain Bishops, be summoned conformable to custom, and required to decide their quarrels by combat. I believe that the Borderers had the good effects of this law almost entirely to themselves, nor do I remember to have heard or read of more than two instances in which strangers availed themselves of it. Between the interior parts of the two kingdoms there was not much commerce of any kind; but the commerce of injuries in particular could not extend far, especially in times of peace, for which only laws could be made; partly, because the force employed in the petty infractions of quiet was not capable of a wide direction, and partly from the very nature of the incursions themselves. There was a law also which regarded the flight of a vassal into either kingdom, whereby, if demanded upon oath within six weeks, he might be recovered by his lord, whether he had fled with or without his goods; but if the demand was made later than that time, the recovery of him was attended with greater difficulty. Debts were to be recovered by an oath taken by the creditor in person upon the Marches, nor were any allowed to make claims of this kind by proxies except the Kings and Bishops before mentioned. The laws which respect these transactions are pretty similar to those which took place in other parts; only, if a debtor of low rank could get other six persons to join with him in swearing that he owed no such debt, he might be acquitted of it. But in matters touching life and limb, and indeed in every claim, a personal attendance to prosecute the quarrel or cause by oath was required of every one but those before excepted; and without this, unless a deputation was made by the consent of both parties, a man's plea was lost for ever. Though the foregoing law did not contain much extraordinary matter, yet its want of singularity is fully compensated by one which immediately follows: for it is there declared, that in every plea between a plaintiff and defendant that affected life and limb, that is, which was to be decided by combat, if the defendant happened to die within the fifteen days preceding the day of trial, his body should be carried to the Marches at the time, and to the place appointed between the two parties, because no man can be assoigned by death. Again, When the appellant delayed his appearance beyond the appointed day, the defendant ought to pass to the Marches, and obtain an attestation from three Barons that he had regularly made his appearance on the day prefixed; and this being signed by them, he was totally exempted from being liable to any challenge upon that score for the future. He had also a right, if any, or all of those Barons to whom he made application should refuse to give such a testimony, to oblige even them to decide the matter by combat; and the same privilege extended also to the appellant. stolen goods were, like debts, demanded upon oath, and might be recovered, unless the person in whose possession they were found chose to deny it; the matter was then referred to the usual mode of decision. With respect to the issue, or, to speak more in the language of the times, conviction of these trials by combat, it is worthy of notice, that whether a person was found guilty, by this means, of theft, or robbery, or murder, his atonement was made by a forfeiture of goods, and he was obliged to find sureties for the completion of this atonement; in consequence of which, there were particular laws respecting the convict, his sureties, and the pursuer. An asylum was, amongst the other circumstances of these laws, allowed to any malefactor who fled from one kingdom to the other: and when he passed from one district or province of the kingdom, in which he had taken refuge, he was entitled to protection upon an application to the sheriff of that district or province into which he entered: or if he could not find the sheriff, he might still obtain peace and protection, by ringing the bells of the first church at which he arrived within such precincts: but on the contrary, if he could be seized by those from whom he had escaped before he performed what was by them called\" obtaining peace,\" in this manner, he might be carried back without opposition. Yet when a quarrel arrived at those circumstances, in which it could only be decided by combat; that is, when one person denied the claim of another, it might still be evaded within the fifteen days, which were generally allowed by ancient custom, as preparatory to such decision: for it was provided, that if the person accused should bring the animal, on account of which the litigation had risen, to the Marches on the day appointed for the combat, and there inform the opposite party that he believed that the property in question belonged to that party, he was exempted from the necessity of a combat; but was obliged to drive the animal into the Tweed or Esk; and if it was drowned before it reached the mid-stream, he was still answerable for it. We know not how they managed this business when the matter of dispute was such as could neither wade nor swim across, for we find no institution regarding the restoration on inanimate property.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",1237,1244],["Tweed",6177,6182]],"geonouns":[["ground",283,289],["force",1844,1849],["pass",3680,3684],["district",4975,4983],["district",5115,5123],["church",5274,5280],["stream",6239,6245]],"pos_words":[["fortunate",208,217],["pleased",368,375],["good",1438,1442],["peace",1782,1787],["quiet",1887,1892],["capable",1901,1908],["recovery",2256,2264],["respect",2520,2527],["pretty",2551,2557],["extraordinary",3091,3104],["right",3944,3949],["privilege",4115,4124],["like",4176,4180],["respect",4369,4376],["worthy",4483,4489],["protection",5061,5071],["peace",5218,5223],["protection",5228,5238],["peace",5456,5461]],"neg_words":[["murder",884,890],["crime",1007,1012],["quarrels",1381,1389],["petty",1866,1871],["difficulty",2298,2308],["debt",2716,2720],["prosecute",2842,2851],["quarrel",2856,2863],["plea",3021,3025],["lost",3030,3034],["plea",3236,3240],["die",3377,3380],["death",3575,3580],["delayed",3608,3615],["liable",3874,3880],["refuse",4017,4023],["stolen",4157,4163],["debts",4181,4186],["deny",4295,4299],["issue",4384,4389],["guilty",4533,4539],["murder",4581,4587],["opposition",5513,5523],["quarrel",5536,5543],["denied",5646,5652],["dispute",6341,6348]],"events":[],"dates":[["six weeks",2110,2119],["the fifteen days",3388,3404],["the day of",3415,3425],["the appointed day",3638,3655],["the day",3790,3797],["the fifteen days",5707,5723],["the day",5943,5950]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",443,448],["between",920,927],["elsewhere",1083,1092],["there",1111,1116],["apart",1159,1164],["there",1653,1658],["without",2184,2191],["without",2938,2945],["there",3206,3211],["between",3515,3522],["there",4737,4742],["within",5301,5307],["without",5505,5512],["within",5700,5706],["there",5981,5986],["opposite",5998,6006]],"spa_preps":[["against",112,119],["against",162,169],["into",2051,2055],["within",2103,2109],["between",3241,3248],["within",3381,3387],["beyond",3631,3637],["amongst",4834,4841],["into",5136,5140],["into",6168,6172],["across",6389,6395]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0133079848,"vader_sentiment":-0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.8477447629},{"para_id":40,"paragraph":"It is needless to make any further reflection upon these laws, than what every one will make upon perusing them in these days of regularity and peace, viz.

From this account, that I may avoid transcribing the whole, it appears, that in the year 1448, wherein he performed this embassy, that the principal subsistence of the Borderers was on hens, geese, and various sorts of gruels, and pottage, but were utterly unacquainted with white bread or wine. This circumstance proves their commerce must have been very little, or none at all, and their agriculture in a very poor condition. Indeed, who would till the ground, when it was so uncertain who should reap, or perhaps burn the crop? We do not find that they wanted hospitality, though it was probably like that of the Arabian, who would perhaps feast you in his house to-day, and rob you in the desart to-morrow. When aeneas arrived at a large village, the name of which he does not mention, the inhabitants of it, men, women, and children, came running about him, to gape and stare at him as at a strange sight, or the appearance of a\" blackamore, or a man of India.\" Having been informed of the scarcity prevailing in those districts, he had received at a certain Abbey some loaves of white bread, and a rundlet of red wine, which to these attendants of his, for they had followed him to the house where he supped, inquiring of their priest whether he was a christian or not, were matters of greater astonishment than himself, having never till that time seen any thing of the kind:\" There approached the table,\" says he, great-bellied women, and their husbands, who handling the bread, and smelling\" the wine, craved some part thereof; and there was no remedy, but to divide and\" give it all away amongst them.\" However, two hours within night they all( i.e. the males,) left aeneas to himself, and repaired with all possible speed, for fear of the scots, to a strong place at a good distance, leaving the women behind, and refusing to accept of aeneas's company; for it seems the scots used at low water to pass over the river, and fall to boot-haling. With respect to their ravenous method of begging mentioned above, I cannot help comparing it to that of the Haiduks, who lead a savage and miserable life amongst the mountains of Dalmatia, and are sometimes compelled by hunger to come down amongst the Morlacchi of the lower country, with manners similar to those of our Borderers: whilst their resorting to places of defence, and leaving their own habitations in times of danger, bears a strong resemblance to the practice of the back-settlers in America, who being, like these, rendered half - savages by situation, and exposed to unforeseen inroads, are necessitated to similar resources, when they are threatened with an Indian war; only there is this distinction, the English savages in America shelter their wives along with themselves, but the English savages on the borders of scotland refused any such allowance to theirs;\" being,\" as aeneas tells us,\" thoroughly perswaded that the enemies will do them no hurt, as who reckon whoredom\" no hurt or evil at all.\" To have done with this account given by aeneas, it appears, particularly from the remaining part of it, that they spent their days in anxiety, and their nights without rest: that, ingrossed with more immediate cares, they had no ideas of any kind of improvement or elegance: that their furniture, employment, accommodations, and dress, bore incontestible marks of the first and rudest stages of society; and that the condition of their women, even making allowance for the effects of habit, must have been particularly unhappy; since, independent of the danger to which they were exposed, and of the continual alarms in which they lived, on account of their situation, they were treated so grossly, and neglected so shamefully by the men, as to be refused the same shelter and defence with themselves; experiencing in this, that usage which, as it is the constant companion, is held by all writers to be a sure sign of the compleatest state of barbarism.

I cannot, however, pass over the method of building each particular house, especially as it is somewhat singular, and begins of late to be disused. From the front-door an entry runs close behind the fire-place of the better kitchen, directly across the building, to the back-door, which opens into a yard where the byres and stables generally are. On one side of this entry is the door leading into the down-house or kitchen, where they brew, bake,&amp; c. ; on the other side of the entry is the passage into the house itself, for so the better kitchen is called; but this passage is close to the back-door, so that before you arrive at the fire you have almost gone round it. The various parts and doors of this entrance into the house are known by the names of Hallen, Heck, and Mill Doors, or the space between the doors. Opposite to the fire-place is the door of the chamber, or, as it is called in its genuine English name, of the Bower, where the master and mistress of the family sleep. The word Parlour is encroaching fast upon its ancient names: its bed is, in the better sort of houses in these times, placed up stairs, or upon the loft, to use the general and ancient expression: the down-house is become back-kitchen; the old name of Ambry, for a pantry, is almost lost; and the sconce, long-settle and hemmil, are superceded by more modern furniture. These are a few of the changes which have been introduced of late days into the custom of building houses in Cumberland and the neighbouring parts within a few years past; and though I am willing to believe that modern fashions may have give more elegance to buildings, yet I am far from thinking that they have provided better in general for excluding either the wintry winds, or the heats of summer. This objection, however, to modern improvements, will not hold in the comparison of the old chimneys with those that are now used: the balk, the randle-tree, the black-hood, and the sloothing, have little to boast of, but their superior utility in drying winter provisions.

Alluding to this subject, I beg leave to remind the reader, that, according to general observation, where money, the nominal representative of property, is scarce, or where it is not known at all, what is now called in a vulgar dialect jobbing, couping, and swapping, becomes of course trade, commerce, and merchandize: we find generally that the current specie of such times has been cattle; and it is instanced as an example, that from them was the mode of computation in the days of Homer, and that hence the Latins derived their name of Money; and indeed it seems natural enough, that a staple commodity should answer for money where money is not. It is from these principles that the petty feudal Lords exacted their rents and dues in this kind of money; or in another commodity equally staple in such times, and that was in personal labour. The relicks of this ancient mode of taxation, though at this time of day exceddingly mitigated, or in some places entirely bought off, or perhaps,( as who can tell!) forgot in troublesome times, and never revived, are still vastly numerous in these parts, perhaps more so than they are elsewhere. Independent of the serjeants-oats mentioned before, and a great variety of curious dues paid by the lands dependent on the castles of the greater lords; independent of the hornage still exacted, and the now obsolete, or at least disguised beacon-rent, paid for giving notice of the approach of enemies; independent of the tolls paid to the city of Carlisle at the passages out of the county, which are still claimed, and of a great many others which may be called localities, there are still different localities, which respect the tenure of lands, and which are partly abolished and partly changed into dues of another kind. For in the troublesome times, of which I made mention in the foregoing paragraphs, and which I shall have occasion to mention again, some tenants held their lands by furnishing a man and a horse, others by furnishing a footman whilst the lord furnished a horseman; other hamlets by furnishing a certain number of bowmen, and others by every individual who held lands appearing in arms when an invasion from the scottish Marches was expected. It is true that the proportions were regulated by contingencies, or by the Lord Warden; but they have now settled into a sort of uniformity, under which, though little noted in general, they are still somewhat retentive of their original distinction, and have now and then given birth to law suits, which the ablest lawyers, conscious of their intricacy, have thought proper to decide by making the antiquity of usage their standard, and by endeavouring to balance the apparent authority of one custom with that of such as might be alledged on a contrary side. The uncertainty of the best investigation of matters of this nature, and the chicane to which they must give birth, need not be adverted to: the different claims which the Princes of Germany could produce upon one another, and which they have occasionally produced, are examples of it, though upon an infinitely larger scale; and though such intricacies are common enough in many parts of England, yet their frequency in the Norhtern parts strengthens the belief, that the masters and owners of lands have in former times been less subject to the uniform controul of civil law than they were generally in other parts which lay further to the south: I must indeed acknowledge, that a circumstance of this sort hardly needs such an argument. With respect to those other tributes to the Lords, which were usual in every place, they belong not so far to me as that I should be particular about them; for being generally known to men of the law, and better than they are to me, I shall only mention such as are particular when I come to the places to which such particular tributes belong. That of the best bed and the best horse paid on the decease of any person, of the boon-days, and many more, are not so unusual as to claim a place here.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Carlisle",1786,1794],["England",3456,3463]],"geonouns":[["head",8,12],["lands",1538,1543],["castles",1561,1568],["beacon",1677,1683],["county",1822,1828],["lands",1980,1985],["lands",2221,2226],["hamlets",2335,2342],["lands",2425,2430],["common",3425,3431],["lands",3562,3567],["bed",4169,4172]],"pos_words":[["enough",123,129],["enough",870,876],["great",1496,1501],["variety",1502,1509],["great",1864,1869],["respect",1958,1965],["distinction",2744,2755],["proper",2874,2880],["best",3090,3094],["enough",3432,3438],["masters",3540,3547],["respect",3812,3819],["better",4012,4018],["best",4164,4168],["best",4181,4185]],"neg_words":[["beg",322,325],["scarce",450,456],["vulgar",515,521],["petty",983,988],["troublesome",1317,1328],["obsolete",1645,1653],["enemies",1732,1739],["troublesome",2075,2086],["unusual",4271,4278]],"events":[],"dates":[["the days",768,776],["day",1210,1213],["boon-days",4234,4243]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["elsewhere",1427,1436],["there",1914,1919],["here",4299,4303]],"spa_preps":[["out",1811,1814],["into",2037,2041],["into",2620,2624],["under",2647,2652],["about",3951,3956]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0171428571,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9864535928},{"para_id":57,"paragraph":"To a person who has been told, and that with great truth, that there is hardly a peasant at this time in these counties who cannot at least read and write, it may seem strange, that, not very long ago, the case was so far different, that in a certain village the poor-rates were collected by means of a notched stick; every notch in which represented a tenement, and the proportion which each was to pay was known by similar means: this stick is still preserved, and has not been so long laid aside but that there are persons still alive who can, to use their own phrase, read it.

The virtue of uneven numbers plainly sprung up in the medical world; and indeed the phrases that still remain in so many countries respecting them, however rude and vulgar, refer obviously to the empiric superstition from whence they originated.

The Germans, like the Borderers of whom I have been speaking, made atonement for blood by means of cattle: Like all the inhabitants of the more solitary places, even though robbers, such as the Arabs and Moss Troopers, they thought it infamous to deny the rites of hospitality to any man of whatever nation: The borderers, as well as the Germans, went armed to every kind of business, and even to their feasts; and in the same manner their quarrels were generally terminated by bloodshed instead of abusive language. Ale also was the beverage of the Germans, as it is now and has long been of the English; But the most remarkable resemblance now left is that of the sport which Tacitus describes as the only one with which the Germans were acquainted, and of which a correct copy, as far as we can judge, may be seen in the sword-dance that is still in vogue in some places contiguous to the Borders. Has it been preserved by imitation, or revived by chance? The funeral howl has been raised in most parts of the world by the heroes of Homer and Virgil, as well as by the women of Germany and Ireland. That animation which the Germans derived, and that omen which they drew from the force and echo of their shouts as they went into battle, were not forgot in the beginning of this century; since Lord Viscount Dundee, as he began the battle at the Pass of Gillicrankie, encouraged his men with them in the contest between King William and the House of stewart. Applicable to this subject, and to the uniformity of manners from uniformity of circumstances, is, that robbery is not considered as shameful amongst the Arabs; nor was it, as we learn from the old poets, amongst the Greeks in more remote times, nor, as history uniformly tells us, amongst the Borderers.

Neither will any one, conversant in history, be at a loss in accounting for the relicks of various languages intermingled with ours: The words compounded of Latin prepositions, and saxon or French verbs and substantives, are a living instance of the heterogeneous mixture. such things I therefore pass by: but when I said that it was perhaps not unworthy of a thinking mind to observe how words exiled from one language still retain their original signification in another of a kindred stock, I meant to be a little more particular. For if Dutch and English words were found by Busbequius, Ambassador from the Emperor to the Ottoman Court in Taurica Chersonesus, we may fairly infer, that languages which have kept company through so many nations must have been very intimate. But to return to my purpose: Bleke in the Dutch is pale; and blake in these dialects is that pale yellow colour which corn assumes when it first begins to ripen. Deilen, to divide, gives birth to the rustic phrase deal or dyal, for a distribution to the poor at a funeral. snell, signifying swift or sharp, is now amongst our vulgar applied to a piercing wind. sneb, a beak, or the tip of the nose, is now called neb, and sometimes applied to a point of land. shorpen, is to shrivel leather or any thing else by fire,&amp; c. ; it has lost its Dutch termination, but still retains its ancient meaning. Again; in the Dutch and the Northern dialects the word long is pronounced lang,&amp; c. To smother also is in Dutch smooren, and here smoor. Prune is pruyn, and pryun. Loom is flow, at present applied to a deep place in a river where the course of the water is retarded. snippen is to nip, with us called snip, and generally applied to the nipping of another person in matters of property. swipe is a word now unused in the English language, and seems to have sunk into sweep; which however does not convey an accurate idea of the meaning, nor do I know of a single word that can: an instrument for lightening the labour of churning, and bears this name, is the best explanation. Again: Pronken is with us to brank or prunk, that is, to look proud and haughty; probably from the effect of the wooden capistrum or head-stool, which bears that name upon horses. Rys, with us rice, is the name of brush-wood; and heel, with us hell, to incline a vessel as is done in pouring out its contents, seems to be lost, except in the language of seamen. Indeed numberless are the words still used in the Dutch which have ceased and become obsolete in the English tongue, remembered only amidst the vulgarity and solitude of some of its dialects.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["field",129,134],["common",732,738],["pass",1054,1058],["point",1979,1984],["land",1988,1992],["river",2358,2363],["water",2388,2393],["head",2949,2953],["wood",3036,3040]],"pos_words":[["well",159,163],["works",635,640],["fairly",1427,1433],["intimate",1524,1532],["swift",1825,1830],["sharp",1834,1839],["accurate",2646,2654],["best",2798,2802],["proud",2878,2883]],"neg_words":[["meddle",272,278],["negligent",396,405],["obsolete",683,691],["loss",810,814],["unworthy",1103,1111],["pale",1585,1589],["pale",1627,1631],["poor",1788,1792],["vulgar",1860,1866],["shrivel",2009,2016],["lost",2069,2073],["smother",2227,2234],["retarded",2397,2405],["swipe",2526,2531],["sunk",2596,2600],["haughty",2888,2895],["hell",3060,3064],["lost",3138,3142],["obsolete",3263,3271]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",2265,2269]],"spa_preps":[["through",1480,1487],["amongst",1848,1855],["into",2601,2605],["out",3108,3111],["amidst",3311,3317]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0332225914,"vader_sentiment":-0.9,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9966596365},{"para_id":64,"paragraph":"There might also be produced a pretty large number of French relicks, but one or two may serve for a specimen.

That my meaning may be more clearly understood, I shall subjoin an example or two. We speak familiarly of a mellow-sound, and a mellow-apple; that is of two things,( the sound and the apple,) exceedingly different; yet because the effect which they produce on the senses is somehow or other similar, we couple them with the same epithet; and having given a name to the sensation excited by the apple, we first apply it to the apple itself, and then to the sound which excited a somewhat-similar sensation; yet still we speak metaphorically, giving the names of our own feelings to the things which excited them: likewise, when the cause corresponds with its effect, we use them indiscriminately for each other, whether the Bishop of Cloyne will give us leave or not: thus, to contain impression upon the senses from external objects, we give the name of Weight and Heaviness, for the feeling or effect is proportional to the cause or body that presses. Again: When a similar sensation is excited by disease, we give it the name of Weight, though there is no pressing body in the case; thence, carrying it further still to that feeling of mind which untoward circumstances produce, we give name of Heaviness and sadness when no disease is present, from its resembling the sensations excited by disease; speaking still in metaphors, though unconscious of it from habit, and always thinking that we express the thing itself, whilst we only express its corresponding idea on our own minds. I have inserted these general observations, because they are particularly applicable to the dialects of which I am speaking; for in them such a mode of speech is remarkably frequent, and indeed constitutes the principal part of discourse. Thus,( that I may select one or two of the numberless instances that might be produced,) a calm day is said to be lown, and a cool-designing man has the same epithet bestowed on him: slape is slippery, and therefore a person in whom one can repose no confidence is a slape hand: that which is smooth and soft is called snod, and hence a man of an easy calm deportment is a snod fellow.

This has been a thing which has puzzled etymologists more perhaps than any other; finding the same word applied in quite different senses, without being in the least able to account for the difference: for when the circumstances which first occasioned it, by presenting some similarity of ideas, have ceased, the word still remains, and gives birth to fresh ones, in a series which seems as if it arose from that poetical turn of which I have already made mention, and which is natural to mankind without their being conscious of it; beginning, forsooth, with things the affinity of which is pretty obvious, but in proportion as they grow numerous extends its plan, multiplies not only its objects, but along with them increases its want of adequate description in direct phrases; and consequently, by means of the similies and metaphors of different degrees, which become necessary to it, multiplies proportionally the modes of expression. ' Tis thus that in a sort of inifinte permutation the native bent of the human mind produces the various terms of a language; and these terms, amongst an active people, do not cease to grow more numerous, till almost every thing has got a name, and every mode of thinking with which they are acquainted a mode of expression, in some sort. After this, the growth of a language is but slow, or perhaps it is static; for, in general, as new things come forward, old ones are thrust out; and thus the language of the day may be prevented from acquiring any considerable increase. By these means, however, it seems that language in general has, from a few rude and half - articulated sounds, acquired its present copiousness, fastidiousness, and customs. such a theory as this,( if it be indeed only a theory,) is strongly backed by observation. Few wants, and few objects, have never been found to produce a copious mode of speech, and where many wants and many objects grew upon those few, what method could the human mind have of pointing them out, but by an analogy to those things which were familiar to them before? The derivatives, which we are still able to trace with a tolerable degree of certainty from a very remote stock, indicate, that such a comparing principle has had no small share in increasing words, and more particularly phrases: They give us also large room to suspect that there is a great number more of the same sort, the clue of which is lost; and that though conjecture, or perhaps something more substantial, may occasionally patch up the affinity of some, yet there are others which have lost sight of their original for ever. We have at least one satisfactory conclusion from the circumstances which were mentioned before, that, whatever it was which gave language birth,( and it was probably the imitation of sounds,) simile and metaphor have been its nurses. Derivation, indeed, and composition have lent their aid, but it was as subalterns, and they only expressed partial changes, affecting the meaning of their originals; whereas, besides these effects, the other from their natural tendency often gave expression even to new ideas. That the reader may have a more compleat notion of what I would inculcate by the foregoing observations, I shall refer him to the treatise which that learned oriental Dr Gregory sharp has writ upon the subject of the Origin of Language; he will there find,( what indeed the small number of the Hebrew roots and the very temper of the language must have made the Doctor feel forcibly,) that, even in far different languages, which were intermingled with a variety of others, a strange transposition of terms had occasionally obtained. He relates, that from the name of a town in Italy where a sort of little swords or daggers were first made, that those daggers took their name; and in imitation of them afterwards, a spanish coin, a diminutive gun, and a dapper fellow; for such an account does he give of the word Pistol. From similar causes arose the names of the Gates of Cilicia and Thermopylae: from a part of the leg the Greeks took their expression for the continuation of a mountainous ridge: the Romans and Macedonians encountered at a place called the Dogs' Heads; and indeed all languages seem more or less to abound with names originating from resemblances either direct or analogical, applied more or less in the stile of metaphors. However, before I go further, it is but fair to acknowledge that the language of Ribaldry, or, as we were wont to call it, Blackguardism, is the most fertile in this kind of poetry, and that a rude mode of speech, from a scantiness of certain terms, is more beholden to it than the more copious and polished, which are on that very account more restricted in the use of new phrases. It is thus that we talk familiar enough of the head, brow, side, foot,&amp; c. of a hill, without ever adverting to that principle in the human mind which gives birth to such expressions, though the allusion is exceedingly obvious. Thus also, as in English the prominence on the face is called Nose, and has a similar name in several languages, a promontory of lands has often the same name, especially in the Northern parts; or, as in scotland and the Isles, is Ness; in Norway it seems to be Naze; and beyond Kamschatka, in the narrow extreme of the Great Pacific Ocean, is Noss: neither will one wonder if all these names should be found to have one original, after considering in how prodigious an extent of nations, utterly disjoined, late navigators have found dialects of the Malay tongue. The sneb of the Dutch corresponds with the word Neb in Cumberland, signifying also nose, and this had in a like manner been applied to capes and headlands: one hill also in these parts is called Tongue, and another saddle-Back. From that part of the entrance of a house which is called Hallen, a narrow turn of the Lake Ulles Water has its name: from a part of the Gullet, which is called Hause,( a term which seems undoubtedly a relick of the Latin verb Haurio,) has been taken the word Hause, applied to a narrow entrance into a valley.

That I may say not entangle either myself or my reader in tracing the origin of a number of different terms, amongst which, though obviously a-kin, it is impossible to know with even a tolerable degree of probability which is the eldest, I shall pick out a certain set of words, amongst which I am almost sure an affinity subsists throughout; though, like every other set, I dare not pretend to say which is the ancestorial word, or that which gave being to the rest, or whether any of those which are now left merit such a name. I am led to the choice of these which follow, by a sentence in the Appendix to Mr West's account of those Lakes, in which he mentions the word scale, and gives, for the sake of elucidating the meaning of the word, this quotation, if I recollect aright, from shakespear,\" to scale' t a little further.\" I beg leave however to observe, before I enter upon the subject of the kindred phrases of the word scale, that I think Mr West's wish of tracing the English language, at least in some degree, to its roots by means of its dialects, a very good one; but that his want of acquaintance with the general mode of accenting particular words, and indeed of the general disposition of the dialect, has misled him several times in the little which he has attempted of this kind. Guthrie also, as far as I remember, in his history of scotland, has some observations on the dialect of that country, indicating, that many original phrases of our language may be found in it, which is very true. However, to return to my subject; it may be remembered, that in Dutch, schil, schulp, or shelp, signifies a shell, which in the dialect of Cumberland is pronounced schell or skell; in that dialect also the word is used for a scale. Belonging to this word therefore are several verbs, with their derivatives: to take any thing from its husk, or shell, is to sheil or shell it, as pease,&amp; c. The husks of oats are called skillings or shillings, and the kernels are groats,( what affinity there has been supposed to exist between these and the coins of that name, I know not.) Again; to scale, is to strip off scales, bark,&amp; c. ; but is more frequently used in a natural sense: thus any kind of crust or scurf, occasioned by disease on the body, is said, on its being detached from it, or falling asunder, to scale off. The dish also wherewith milk is skimmed has the name of a scale-dish; whether from its scaling off the cream, or from its diminishing to a thin edge like a scale or skell, is not quite obvious, but probably from both; neither is it impossible, that, before the invention of wooden dishes, milk might be skimmed with a shell in reality: every kind of dish likewise which is thin at the margin is a scale-dish; and such are those wooden ones which were formerly, and are still, in some cases, suspended at the end of a balance for the purpose of weighing; hence the name of the scales, and a pair of scales; which words are in process of time used indiscriminately, and sometimes in the singular number, for the balance itself; and thence extended by metaphor to the deliberating faculties of the mind, and to every thing which is a counterpoise to that which opposes it; being moreover variously modified according to the nature of circumstances. The hull of a ship is called its skell, as is also a house without its furniture. The booths likewise, constructed for the watchers of cattle in summer, amidst the most uncultivated parts, were skells or scales; and their Latin name in the deeds of those times is scalingae: these buildings, however, afterwards grew into towns, which took their names accordingly, as sea-scale,( scalinga ad mare,) scale, scale-fell, skelton, scalesby, Booth Scale,&amp; c. : of the same stock is the name of a certain fish, skelly; and of a bird, skell-Drake. I might be laughed at for suggesting that shelf, in this dialect skelf; or skelvin, the name of the additional rail that goes round a cart, are from the same origin: however, was I not afraid of being tedious, I could produce an account of things that would give such a suggestion no small degree of probability.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Lakes",835,840],["Cumberland",1852,1862]],"geonouns":[["country",1609,1616],["edge",2682,2686],["ship",3498,3502],["house",3537,3542],["buildings",3765,3774],["towns",3806,3811],["sea",3852,3855]],"pos_words":[["respect",13,20],["like",152,156],["sharp",160,165],["tolerable",384,393],["affinity",512,520],["like",550,554],["merit",710,715],["led",734,737],["good",1269,1273],["affinity",2194,2202],["like",2687,2691]],"neg_words":[["entangle",218,226],["impossible",353,363],["pretend",583,590],["beg",1033,1036],["falling",2507,2514],["asunder",2515,2522],["impossible",2770,2780],["indiscriminately",3184,3200],["fell",3896,3900],["rail",4140,4144],["afraid",4214,4220],["tedious",4230,4237]],"events":[],"dates":[["the end of",3042,3052],["summer",3629,3635]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["throughout",530,540],["left",705,709],["there",2203,2208],["without",3543,3550]],"spa_preps":[["amongst",308,315],["out",450,453],["amongst",478,485],["between",2236,2243],["amidst",3637,3643],["into",3801,3805],["round",4155,4160]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0026385224,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9784850478},{"para_id":75,"paragraph":"V.

The consequences of this, added to the opportunity and habit of rapine, must not a little add to their broils and instability: thus in the times of Edward I. when those countries had long been considered as a part of England, we find, that several of the Cumberland gentleman, amongst whose names I remember that of seaton Lord of Gamelsby, and Glassonby, forfeited their estates for taking the part of Robert Bruce and the scots against him. Indeed there long subsisted an intimacy, by means of very close family-connections, between the principal families of Cumberland and those of the opposite side of the Firth, particularly of Annandale: before that period, the disturbances had a more irregular, though perhaps a less pernicious direction; and he, by inflaming former animosities, and by putting an end to all such connections,( at least as far as the severity of his government could do it,) made the distinction between an Englishman and scotsman observed with a more rancorous nicety than before. It is true, we are informed, that when the Romans first quitted their rampire and forsook Britain, the fury of the Barbarians was such as to destroy even every thing that might be a vestige of itself; but the retreat of many of the saxons northward, on the Norman invasion, and several circumstances prior to that event, had produced considerable, though only temporary changes; for though one remembers the horrid fury of the Gallovegians in their invasions, yet one also calls to mind certain intervals of tranquility, wherein the temper of individuals produced no such continual effects as took place afterwards. We find, moreover, the Cumbri mentioned as composing a part of the army which the scots King David led against stephen, before that country was regularly ceded to the scots; and as in the next reign they composed a part of the English forces, one may infer that their attachment to neither could be very strong. Likewise, when we are told that Cumberland, long before the period of which we are speaking, was ceded to the scots on the condition of paying homage for it\" for fear\" it should revolt,\" we may be pretty well satisfied in what light the attachment of its inhabitants to their southern neighbours was viewed: nor is it wonderful, that such attachment was considered as suspicious, when one reflects that these Cumbri were a part of the Britons whom the intrusion of their saxon conquerors had forced to to the northwards, in the same manner as it compelled another portion to a similar refuge amongst the mountains of Wales, and as many of those very saxons were afterwards forced to give way to, and seek refuge from the prevailing power of the Normans. A cession of the country from Tweed to Eden was again made by Edgar to Kenneth, on condition that the inhabitants should retain their ancient name, language, and customs: a cession which seems as if calculated for keeping up broils, for laying the foundation of consequent claims from the English, and for alienating the minds of the inhabitants from both parties. Indeed the independence of their chieftains must have been considerable, and not a little flattered, when Malcolm refused the award of English Peers in his dispute with Rufus concerning his possessions in England, because it had been customary that disputes should be settled by\" principal men on the Marches.\"","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",213,223],["Westmoreland",228,240],["England",738,745],["Cumberland",776,786],["Cumberland",1082,1092],["Britain",1618,1625],["Cumberland",2488,2498],["Wales",3073,3078],["Tweed",3240,3245],["Eden",3249,3253],["England",3780,3787]],"geonouns":[["moor",144,148],["foot",174,178],["countries",690,699],["country",2276,2283],["forces",2379,2385],["mountains",3060,3069],["country",3227,3234]],"pos_words":[["wonder",319,325],["well",362,366],["interests",468,477],["intimacy",995,1003],["distinction",1430,1441],["tranquility",2036,2047],["led",2243,2246],["strong",2448,2454],["homage",2599,2605],["pretty",2653,2659],["well",2660,2664],["satisfied",2665,2674],["wonderful",2774,2783],["award",3701,3706]],"neg_words":[["instability",635,646],["irregular",1213,1222],["pernicious",1246,1256],["severity",1380,1388],["fury",1631,1635],["destroy",1669,1676],["retreat",1737,1744],["horrid",1936,1942],["fury",1943,1947],["temper",2061,2067],["fear",2618,2622],["revolt",2634,2640],["suspicious",2824,2834],["intrusion",2908,2917],["refused",3689,3696],["dispute",3731,3738]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",971,976],["between",1048,1055],["northward",1767,1776],["northwards",2965,2975]],"spa_preps":[["amongst",798,805],["against",951,958],["close",1022,1027],["opposite",1110,1118],["between",1442,1449],["against",2247,2254],["amongst",3048,3055]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0062695925,"vader_sentiment":-0.88,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9926891923},{"para_id":78,"paragraph":"After the conquest, we find that the number and dignity of the saxon Refugees in scotland was very great; but as a cause of many very shocking outrages and butcheries that there existed in the Highlanders, and Gallowaymen, an excessive hatred of the English Scots, which hatred they displayed on every opportunity.

The tomb of its last King Dunmail is yet to be seen on the confines of Lancashire, on the road that leads from the Vale of st John's, at a place which is called Dunmail Rays. It appears from the materials of this tomb, which is nothing but a large heap of stones, that the ancient rude, and( if I may be allowed the expression) druidical rites of sepulture, were still in vogue; or at least, that those of christianity had not yet taken place. The prodigious tract of country over which the first Bishops of Lendisfairn presided, and the annual circuits which they made for the purposes of conversion, add to the truth of this observation. History indeed, always says, that Cumberland was brought into subjection by the saxons later than any other part of England; and this will account for the many British relicks to be found there. The Britons might, it is true, be Christians before the arrival of the saxons, but the monument of King Dunmail shews that they had not, even long after that, adopted the practice in general of what we call Christian Burial: from thence we may infer with respect to other things, and indeed easily bring manifold authorities to support the various circumstances arising from such an inference, independent of that solitude, and that wildness, which, as they obstruct commerce, prevent innovation. I shall but instance one: Everard, Abbot of Holm Cultreyn, who lived in the reign of Henry Ii. tells us, that the name of Thorsby is from a temple which the Pagans had there; and that a place near it called Carthew,( at present Cardew) signifies the Fen of God. I might mention also, that the village Kirkby Thor in Westmoreland reminds one of the same barbarous God that Thorsby does; and they both, along with many more, indicate a long and tenacious remembrance of former prejudices. Nor do such places seem to have been afterwards, probably from their situation, favourable to regular institutions of a religious kind: the church of Bewcastle( which was indeed exposed to enemies in a particular manner) had in the days of Edward I. an income of L. 19 per annum, in those of Henry Viii. of L. 2. and in the time of war, Nohing.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",8,18],["Lancashire",228,238],["Cumberland",831,841],["England",913,920],["Holm",1533,1537],["Kirkby",1790,1796],["Westmoreland",1805,1817]],"geonouns":[["road",247,251],["stones",413,419],["country",625,632],["monument",1079,1087],["village",1782,1789],["church",2116,2122]],"pos_words":[["leads",257,262],["prodigious",605,615],["respect",1247,1254],["support",1320,1327],["innovation",1477,1487],["tenacious",1932,1941]],"neg_words":[["rude",438,442],["subjection",859,869],["obstruct",1450,1458],["barbarous",1842,1851],["prejudices",1964,1974],["enemies",2165,2172]],"events":[],"dates":[["year",73,77],["annual",695,701],["Ii.",1580,1583],["the days",2204,2212],["19",2242,2244],["2",2286,2287]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",985,990],["there",1657,1662]],"spa_preps":[["over",633,637],["into",854,858],["near",1681,1685],["along",1890,1895]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.9,"roberta_sentiment":-0.997844696},{"para_id":83,"paragraph":"With respect to Roman antiquities I need only observe, that two thirds of the stationary forces which they maintained in Britain were, according to the best historians, employed on the Borders; where the Romans themselves relate, that their soldiers carried on a business literally the same as moss-trooping with the barbarians.

The monuments of the Romans which have been found in Cumberland shew, that far from imposing their own divinities upon the nations, they even acquiesced in the belief of those whom they vanquished, and erected altars to the gods of the parts where they resided. In later times things were altered, and the characteristic monuments are those of barbarism, cruelty, and bloodshed. Whatever courage continual danger may give to the human mind, it cannot be favourable, on several accounts, to improvements or changes either in religion or manners: under its impressions there is hardly leisure to think of innovations; it induces moreover a superstitious dread, which will not easily permit men to be bold in speculation, or dare to annul at once the authority of those gods whom they have been taught to consider as their protectors. such a life leaves no room for the ideas of improved society, nor will it permit the niceties of learning to grow upon the rudeness of antiquated superstition. Whilst it prevents study and refinement at home, it also repels the means of them from abroad; by threatening their teachers with the same, or, as was often the case, with greater perils. such I apprehend is the principal cause of the numerous vestiges of ancient manners to be found in the Borders. We have no doubt how late it was before any degree of civilization rose, and find on record under what difficulties, and at how modern a period, Christianity acquired an establishment there: for though it might be early known and preached on the Western Border, yet avarice and rapine in a manner quenched it, nor had it a seminary or fixed seat from whence it could diffuse itself. Even after the pious bounty of the Royal Earl of Huntingdon had erected Holm Cultram, and the murderous hospitality of the Lord of Gillsland had given occasion to the building of Lanercost, we find that those very houses were levelled at times, or burned, amidst the general ruin of the neighbourhood, and the Priests butchered, or flying from scenes of almost-unequalled wildness and desolation. Numerous safeguards,( for so they are called,) or lodgings beneath the ground, which also are yet to be seen, indicate the horrid nature of these transactions, and hint what the manners of men must have been in those times; for they were times when ferocious customs struck at the very existence of society, bidding defiance to all means of civilizations; when laws held them in with a palsied hand, and the dependence of the inhabitants on a regular government was uncertain and unregarded.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",105,115],["Holm",1799,1803]],"geonouns":[["monuments",56,65],["monuments",373,382],["seat",1685,1689],["building",1894,1902],["houses",1941,1947],["ground",2195,2201]],"pos_words":[["courage",440,447],["improvements",542,554],["improved",928,936],["refinement",1073,1083],["modern",1472,1478]],"neg_words":[["loose",6,11],["imposing",136,144],["cruelty",407,414],["bloodshed",420,429],["danger",458,464],["superstitious",690,703],["dread",704,709],["antiquated",1019,1029],["superstition",1030,1042],["threatening",1142,1153],["vestiges",1288,1296],["doubt",1355,1360],["difficulties",1447,1459],["avarice",1610,1617],["murderous",1821,1830],["burned",1975,1981],["ruin",2002,2006],["desolation",2112,2122],["horrid",2247,2253],["struck",2391,2397],["defiance",2440,2448],["uncertain",2590,2599]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",619,624],["home",1087,1091],["abroad",1131,1137],["there",1528,1533]],"spa_preps":[["under",597,602],["under",1436,1441],["amidst",1983,1989],["beneath",2183,2190]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.080952381,"vader_sentiment":-0.97,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9935043454},{"para_id":88,"paragraph":"Vii. As the business of the following Plans is to conduct the strangers to those places which furnish the views and landscapes of different kinds in the neighbourhood of these Lakes, and which the taste of the times has been so pleased with, I shall offer nothing upon that subject here, but an observation which I think the greatest artist will excuse: It is, that those pictures impart the most grateful sensations to the mind, which are expressive, not only of general beauties, or such as may be found common to most places, but of the particular nature and local genius of the country from the objects of which they are drawn. Thus a funny day, a stream of water, a ruin, or other kind of building, may be with almost every where, and may be sorted in such a manner as to form a pleasant view: But the solemnity of those vapours which hang upon mountains in drizzly and gleamy weather, the shades which they occasion, their silent mixing and rolling together, their magnifying effects, with the tops of the mountains peeping above, as it were in another world, lead away the mind from scenes of cultivation, and present ideas of a new, but not less pleasing kind. It is unnatural, at least it feels so to me, and subversive of the general tenor of the piece, to be studious of introducing copies of the works of man, and numerous living figures, amidst such solitudes. For example, I have seen a drawing of Dun Dornadilla, in the North Highlands, which seemed to me excellent in its kind: there was a pensive loneliness about that ruined pile which corresponded well with the dreary nakedness of the vast hills that rose around it. On the contrary, I have seen views of the mountains contiguous to these lakes, at the bases of which were delineated chaises and waggons: such vehicles might indeed possibly be dragged along there, but they were far from being,( if I may be allowed the expression,) native objects, or consonant with the rest of the piece.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Lakes",176,181]],"geonouns":[["landscapes",116,126],["common",506,512],["country",582,589],["stream",652,658],["water",662,667],["building",694,702],["mountains",850,859],["mountains",1012,1021],["hills",1610,1615],["mountains",1679,1688],["lakes",1709,1714]],"pos_words":[["pleased",228,235],["greatest",325,333],["grateful",397,405],["sensations",406,416],["genius",568,574],["pleasant",784,792],["silent",929,935],["tops",1000,1004],["lead",1066,1070],["pleasing",1154,1162],["works",1308,1313],["excellent",1471,1480],["well",1567,1571]],"neg_words":[["excuse",346,352],["ruin",671,675],["hang",840,844],["unnatural",1175,1184],["subversive",1218,1228],["loneliness",1514,1524],["ruined",1536,1542],["dreary",1581,1587],["dragged",1814,1821]],"events":[],"dates":[["a funny day",637,648]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",282,286],["there",1494,1499],["there",1828,1833]],"spa_preps":[["together",955,963],["above",1030,1035],["away",1071,1075],["amidst",1351,1357],["about",1525,1530],["around",1626,1632],["along",1822,1827]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0251572327,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9914575219},{"para_id":89,"paragraph":"I may here be asked, what I meant in my seventh paragraph, at the beginning of this Introduction, mentioning the affinity between painting and poetry?

A desart of wood it has indeed been, though in many places as poor as that of almost any country, and as ill calculated for the purposes of agriculture; particularly in the mosses that are amongst, or perhaps upon the mountains: these however have their woods; the birch, the wild-ash, the wythe, as it is called, and some others, are disposed to grow even in the wildest situations: slow in their growth, it is true, and for the most part stunted; which may be attributed to their being grazed upon by sheep, and naked to the winds; for as those places which seem at present most unpromising with respect to this kind of vegetation, and where( particularly in peat-mosses on the tops of pretty high hills) no man can easily persuade himself that a stick of any kind would grow, are found yet filled with the roots, trunks, and branches of trees of very different sizes; it seems as if those places did but want their original encouragement to become forests again. It may indeed be alledged, in opposition to such a thought, that the soil itself has undergone a material change, that the fall of the woods and the stagnation of waters has given birth to that vegetation which constitutes peat-mosses, and that this vegetation in an accumulation of putrid vegetable matter. If this be the case, yet still such putrid matter is found to be that of the roots of that plant, which in these parts is called Bent, and not of timber, which is generally preserved entire; and as this Bent seems the native and aboriginal growth of such Moors, who can prove that it did not exist at the same time as the woods, and that it did not occasion mosses then? Independent, however, of this, the circumstances which have fallen in the way of my observation make me think it far from impossible, that, were these countries left desolate by man and the tamer animals, for a great number of years that the ancient appearances would arise at large, and a sylvan wildness efface the labours of the husbandman: this would begin probably in the warmer and more fertile places, and proceed gradually, one tree sheltering and encouraging another, to those which are more exposed and barren. There are still whole forests left on the sides of some hills, where many of the trees find nutriment almost upon the bare rock; they are also to be found in the more inaccessible parts of others, that are elsewhere naked. I do not indeed know of any positive evidence that can be produced, either on this side of the question or on the opposite one, neither does the discussion of it belong particularly to my subject; yet it may be proper to mention, as analogous to what has gone before, that in three old manuscripts I have found mention made of the porklings which ran wild in the woods growing on the sides of the hills above Mungrisdale; that these porklings belonged to the Monks, who had a chauntry at a place called stow in that neighbourhood; that from these Monks the chapel has a part of its name, and the other part from the old word signifying swine. In Grisdale also you will, as in many other places, be told by some person or another, that in former times the trees were so close together, that a man has gone a certain distance, or ascended such or such a hill, without touching the ground, and merely travelling from the top of one tree to that of another; nor are these times so very remote, but your informer will in general tell you the name of the man whose forefather, at the distance of three or four ages, he was; yet a place less likely for the growth of timber, or more devoid of it at present, will not easily be found in the North of England. Even this, however, does not militate against what I formerly advanced; for trees will grow there, if encouraged; and some kinds, as the asp, seem particularly disposed to propagate themselves.

I have heard also, that King John was very intent on destroying the forests of the North of England, and caused a great quantity of ground to be cleared; but neither of these causes affect much the disforesting of which we now speak, of which the effects are at this day so visible, and which, at least in my opinion, was the work of many ages, and undertaken on very different occasions. Great roads generally carry a degree of cultivation into the particular district through which they pass, and the less important ones, or by-ways, may be supposed to have a similar effect; though we find that in some places of Cumberland those effects were often, nay, for the most part interrupted by the ruggedness of the country, and the robbers that infested such ways. The neighbourhood also of towns and fortified places furnished occasion by the shelter which such places gave to small towns; as was and yet is the case with respect to Carlisle and its adjacent villages, together with many others scattered up and down the country near the ruins of the fortresses; others again owe their origin to the collections of sheds and booths under which those lodged who watched the cattle, or the fords of rivers. Of these I have made mention before; but those districts have for the most part been cultivated at a later period than the rest, where the houses stand distinct from one another, each in their own portion of land, and with its own name; for such were inclosed, or at least marked out all at once; and every man fixed his residence in the portion allotted to him, as is at present not uncommon on the inclosure of pasture-grounds. But this implies a security not much experienced in former times; and of such kind of regular allotment we have no records, but such as are modern, in comparison of what we know concerning those things which I have already mentioned, as giving occasion to villages, and of course to some degree of cultivation; to as much at least as might, however confined and imperfect, and however far from general, supply the inhabitants with bread, whilst the waste lands supported their cattle, and the woods furnished their game.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",610,617],["Cumberland",1134,1144],["Carlisle",1450,1458]],"geonouns":[["forests",586,593],["ground",650,656],["roads",913,918],["district",979,987],["pass",1007,1011],["country",1231,1238],["towns",1307,1312],["towns",1400,1405],["villages",1476,1484],["country",1538,1545],["rivers",1714,1720],["districts",1769,1778],["houses",1861,1867],["land",1930,1934],["residence",2043,2052],["grounds",2143,2150],["villages",2408,2416],["lands",2607,2612],["woods",2645,2650]],"pos_words":[["industrious",215,226],["enough",378,384],["great",632,637],["cleared",663,670],["work",844,848],["important",1026,1035],["respect",1439,1446],["modern",2292,2298],["supported",2613,2622]],"neg_words":[["enemies",277,284],["infested",1261,1269],["ruins",1555,1560],["confined",2501,2509],["imperfect",2514,2523],["waste",2601,2606]],"events":[],"dates":[["this day",780,788]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["against",479,486],["into",959,963],["through",988,995],["together",1486,1494],["down",1529,1533],["near",1546,1550],["under",1649,1654],["out",2002,2005]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0142857143,"vader_sentiment":0.43,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9949626923},{"para_id":93,"paragraph":"When therefore I say that the nature of the soil of these countries particularly inclines them to become a forest, I comprise their general character; which I cannot better exemplify, than by taking notice of the prodigious oaks, yews, elms, and other trees which lately were and indeed yet are visible in many places.

We find it mentioned, that Henry Iii. in the third year of his reign, disforested that part of the Forest of Englewood which is contiguous to the town of Dalston. William de la Wast Dale, a hermit, was the first who made any inclosures in sabergham. Bewcastle, as it is now called, formerly belonged to the Barony of Brough; it was laid waste entirely by the incursions of the scots, until its old masters undertook, after a considerable space of time, to feed their cattle there in summer, and constructed booths and huts for the herdsmen: those becoming permanent habitations, are said to have given the name of Booth Castle, or Bew Castle, to the old Roman fortress which stood there. Adard de Logili, Lord of Wigton, was the first who inclosed a parcel of ground near Carlisle, called Blackhill, from a rising ground amidst it covered with black heath: Cardew, in the same neighbourhood, was made habitable in the time of Rufus: Raughton was a desart much later, and was first cleared by one Ughtred( whose posterity were called de Raughton) being held by him as a fee-farm for taking care of the hawks in Englewood for the King: skelton( formerly scale-town, or Villa ad scalingas) was civilized by the Boyvill of Livington, who built scales here for the watchers of his cattle anno 1120, in the reign of Henry I. It was a tract covered with whins, and indeed such did its contiguous waste-ground remain, till within these last 20 years. Plumpton was first disparked by Henry Viii. and rendered an habitation of men; it was afterwards made a manor, and given by James I. to the Lord Maxwell of scotland: moreover, the word Thwaite, Moor, Wood,&amp; c. which make a part of the names of so many villages, evidence their situation in former times. Omitting, however, further extracts from the accounts which are furnished by manuscripts, or are printed, I shall just quote the relation of the first settlement of Caldbeck and its neighbouring places. A high way, or beaten street( the vestiges of which are yet to be seen) extended from Westmoreland along the mountain called High Street into the eastern side of Cumberland, and thence westward through Caldbeck; a passage than which one more ugly, crooked, uneven, or dangerous, cannot easily be conceived. Caldbeck was, long after the conquest, a savage waste, untamed by human industry; and the rest of this road lay through grounds still wilder in their nature, and for the most part utterly devoid to this day of improvement, of which indeed they are not capable. Robbers, therefore, who haunted the woods and mountains through which it passed, made it exceedingly dangerous; on which account Randolph Engaine, chief forester of Englewood, allowed the Prior of Carlisle to erect an hospital for the relief of such passengers as might happen to be assaulted, and stripped or wounded by those robbers, or stopped in their journey by the snows and storms of Winter. The Prior had also leave to inclose a part where the church now stands, and this inclosure became afterwards a portion of the church-glebe; but the forester would not grant to this establishment the right of the soil, because large deer lodged in the woods of the mountains around it, and the whole district was then used as a park or forest; besides, the right of the soil belonged properly to the heirs of the Barons of Allerdale, of the state of which family at this time a pretty regular account is given. After the foundation of the hospital a church was also built in honour of st Mungo and Caldbeck; Uppiton( Uppertown) became fully inhabited; Hesket next, and Halt Cleugh( or High Cliff, from the rock above it) were tilled, being likely for producing corn, and called Caldbeck Underfell. The Priors of Carlisle were, by William de Vescy and Burga his wife, and by dame Alice Romeley lady of Allerdale, made patrons of the rectory; upon which, about the reign of King John, they dissolved the hospital, and endowed the church with the lands belonging to it. In the reign of Henry Iii. one John Francigena, or French, kinsman of Gilbert Fran\u00e7ois, or French, Lord of Routhcliff, was parson of Caldbeck, and procured a large inclosure upon the adjoining hill, which is called Warnel Fell; but the Monks of Holm Cultram now interfered, and raised such a litigation with respe\u00e7t to his right to this parcel, that he was glad, for the sake of peace, to consign half of it to them. As memorials of these affairs, there still remain several names of places in and about Caldbeck, such as that of Friar Hall, and of Parson Park, or of the inclosure upon Warnell Fell that has already been mentioned.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",112,122],["Brough",589,595],["Castle",892,898],["Castle",907,913],["Wigton",985,991],["Carlisle",1044,1052],["Plumpton",1715,1723],["Caldbeck",2188,2196],["Westmoreland",2312,2324],["High Street",2351,2362],["Cumberland",2388,2398],["Caldbeck",2428,2436],["Caldbeck",2533,2541],["Carlisle",2991,2999],["Caldbeck",3790,3798],["Hesket",3844,3850],["Caldbeck",3970,3978],["Carlisle",4004,4012],["Caldbeck",4392,4400],["Holm",4504,4508],["Caldbeck",4763,4771],["Park",4815,4819]],"geonouns":[["county",102,108],["town",418,422],["ground",1032,1038],["ground",1086,1092],["farm",1345,1349],["town",1430,1434],["ground",1667,1673],["villages",1971,1979],["street",2248,2254],["mountain",2335,2343],["road",2636,2640],["grounds",2653,2660],["woods",2830,2835],["mountains",2840,2849],["church",3246,3252],["church",3319,3325],["woods",3444,3449],["mountains",3457,3466],["district",3492,3500],["park",3520,3524],["forest",3528,3534],["church",3742,3748],["rock",3898,3902],["church",4220,4226],["lands",4236,4241],["hill",4452,4456]],"pos_words":[["clearly",201,208],["masters",670,677],["cleared",1253,1260],["improvement",2743,2754],["capable",2785,2792],["exceedingly",2883,2894],["relief",3029,3035],["right",3392,3397],["right",3549,3554],["properly",3576,3584],["pretty",3670,3676],["right",4582,4587],["glad",4616,4620],["peace",4638,4643]],"neg_words":[["waste",609,614],["waste",1661,1666],["vestiges",2260,2268],["ugly",2468,2472],["crooked",2474,2481],["uneven",2483,2489],["dangerous",2494,2503],["savage",2574,2580],["waste",2581,2586],["utterly",2713,2720],["devoid",2721,2727],["dangerous",2895,2904]],"events":[],"dates":[["the third year",313,327],["summer",755,761],["1120",1560,1564],["these last 20 years",1694,1713],["this day",2731,2739],["Winter",3185,3191]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",10,14],["there",746,751],["there",953,958],["here",1519,1523],["westward",2411,2419],["there",4707,4712]],"spa_preps":[["near",1039,1043],["amidst",1093,1099],["within",1687,1693],["along",2325,2330],["into",2363,2367],["through",2420,2427],["through",2645,2652],["through",2850,2857],["around",3467,3473],["above",3903,3908],["about",4145,4150],["about",4757,4762]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0045146727,"vader_sentiment":0.85,"roberta_sentiment":0.990626812},{"para_id":95,"paragraph":"so much for the soil and its first cultivation.

Near the sources of the Caldew is a valley called swineside, never visited by the rays of the sun during the Winter months: on the northern side of the hill which overshadows it in this manner, and at a considerable height above the valley, is a pretty large bason of water, called Booth Scale-tarn; three fourths of which is surrounded either by an exceedingly steep heath, or by entire rocks, and the other fourth, being the side right above the valley, gives an outlet to the water. A road leads from the low grounds to this lake, and from the outlet winds above half round it, gradually ascending to some rocks where are slate-quarries, on account of which it was first made; near these quarries the road is a considerable height above the lake, and the perpendicular height of the hill above it cannot be less than four hundred yards; on the other side of this height the descent is at an angle of perhaps fifty degrees, but on this at a much greater. On a wet and windy day, in Autumn, I once took a ride with two companions to this lake: the wind blew directly over the height which I mentioned, not striking upon us except in uncertain puffs, on account of the intervention of the hill; that is, the wind, inpinging on the inclined plane of the other side of the hill, was compelled, towards the summit of it, in an oblique direction, its powers continually increasing, and itself being more and more condensed by the addition of fresh air pressing on its course in a similar diverted manner. This current at the summit met with the regular wind, and after striking violently on the mass of air moving in higher regions, was, by means of a combination of the weight and motion of that air, at last repelled into the tranquil and stagnant air beneath, where there was not a resistance from motion, and thus occasioned the wind of which I am speaking. It was this wind which amused me very much at that time: I was looking at the lake beneath, and saw it grow black near the center; the spot where this first appeared changed directly into a livid appearance, by being contrasted with the rest of the water, through which from this spot, as a fixed point, rolled concentric circles of waves towards the circumference in a manner, whilst the center itself remained quite smooth and undisturbed. The wind which produced this agitation immediately after ascended the sides on the bason, and affected us with very great force; I could also observe the heath on the other sides of the pool shook by the same, and in the same main direction from a... very forcibly. such was the effects that I observed: I am told, however, that others have known a wind of the same kind, in dry weather, snatch the water out of the pool, and scatter it as spray through the whole of this imprisoned space.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Caldew",434,440]],"geonouns":[["rocks",295,300],["force",342,347],["valley",446,452],["hill",562,566],["valley",643,649],["water",678,683],["tarn",704,708],["rocks",798,803],["valley",858,864],["outlet",875,881],["water",889,894],["road",898,902],["grounds",922,929],["lake",938,942],["outlet",957,963],["rocks",1019,1024],["quarries",1041,1049],["quarries",1101,1109],["road",1114,1118],["lake",1154,1158],["hill",1196,1200],["lake",1449,1453],["hill",1599,1603],["hill",1681,1685],["summit",1714,1720],["summit",1931,1937],["regions",2030,2037],["lake",2346,2350],["water",2517,2522],["point",2565,2570],["force",2832,2837],["water",3109,3114]],"pos_words":[["pretty",656,662],["exceedingly",760,771],["right",842,847],["leads",903,908],["striking",1517,1525],["fresh",1848,1853],["striking",1975,1983],["tranquil",2134,2142],["smooth",2686,2692],["great",2826,2831]],"neg_words":[["object",73,79],["breaks",159,165],["impinge",210,217],["steep",772,777],["uncertain",1544,1553],["oblique",1734,1741],["violently",1984,1993],["stagnant",2147,2155],["resistance",2191,2201],["livid",2458,2463]],"events":[],"dates":[["the Winter months",515,532],["day",1386,1389],["Autumn",1394,1400]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["beyond",242,248],["above",633,638],["above",1144,1149],["beneath",2160,2167],["there",2175,2180]],"spa_preps":[["below",315,320],["above",848,853],["above",970,975],["round",981,986],["near",1090,1094],["above",1201,1206],["over",1478,1482],["into",2125,2129],["beneath",2351,2358],["near",2382,2386],["into",2451,2455],["through",2524,2531],["out",3115,3118],["through",3156,3163]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":-0.04,"roberta_sentiment":0.9910231829},{"para_id":99,"paragraph":"As I am now to speak of the Helm Wind, it may be necessary, for the sake of those readers who have not seen any thing of the kind, to premise, that Cross Fell is one - continued ridge, stretching without any branches, or even subject to mountains, except two or three conical hills called Pikes, from the N.N.W. to the s.s.

When this heap first gathers upon the hill, there is seen above it a black streak of cloud continually flying off, and continually fed from the white one, which is the real Helm: this is called the Helm Bar, from its being supposed to bar or obstruct the winds that burst forth upon the vallies beneath as soon as it wholly vanishes: its direction is parallel to that of the white cloud, and it seems in continual motion, as if boiling, or at least agitated by a violent wind; and indeed the wind which really does follow its removal is sometimes prodigious violent, varying with respect to the extent of territory which it affects, in proportion to the force and direction of what I shall here call the Real Winds. sometimes when these are its direct antagonists, and in full force, it does not reach further than two or three miles; nor do I know, that, even without such impediment, it ever extends further than thirteen or fourteen; being interrupted in its progress by the vis inertiae of the air at large, or by some cause arising from the impulse of contrary currents. However, though it always bears a certain proportion to the force and direction of the real winds, its own intrinsic force is not always equal, nor is it found so, even at the foot of the hill; where, on account of the shortness of its course, the action of contrary currents, or the resistance of the air, cannot be supposed to have had any material effect in changing the degree of its power, or of interrupting its progress. It may however be remembered as a truth, that, near the base of the mountain, it is at times excessively strong, bearing almost every thing before it, though at the distance of a very few miles not felt at all.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cross Fell",1054,1064],["Helm",1171,1175],["Helm",1448,1452],["Helm",1473,1477]],"geonouns":[["ridge",34,39],["summit",214,220],["mountains",258,267],["regions",842,849],["mountain",965,973],["head",1046,1050],["hill",1313,1317],["force",1929,1934],["force",2052,2057],["force",2411,2416],["force",2468,2473],["foot",2527,2531],["hill",2539,2543],["mountain",2847,2855]],"pos_words":[["prodigious",87,97],["clear",312,317],["mighty",365,371],["grand",427,432],["regard",456,462],["tranquility",701,712],["prodigious",1822,1832],["respect",1855,1862],["progress",2237,2245],["progress",2769,2777],["strong",2884,2890]],"neg_words":[["mist",321,325],["solemn",437,443],["indiscriminate",592,606],["invisible",683,692],["commotion",743,752],["depressions",1013,1024],["issues",1267,1273],["cloud",1360,1365],["obstruct",1517,1525],["cloud",1656,1661],["boiling",1703,1710],["violent",1738,1745],["violent",1833,1840],["impediment",2149,2159],["shortness",2570,2579],["resistance",2635,2645],["excessively",2872,2883]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["two or three miles",2090,2108],["a very few miles",2956,2972]],"loc_advs":[["there",40,45],["there",335,340],["northward",1091,1100],["there",1319,1324],["beneath",1570,1577],["here",1965,1969],["without",2136,2143]],"spa_preps":[["beneath",668,675],["amidst",732,738],["above",1333,1338],["near",2826,2830]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.024,"vader_sentiment":0.87,"roberta_sentiment":0.9981074333},{"para_id":101,"paragraph":"such is the Helm Wind generated in that enormous cloud, which, like a helmet, covers the summit of Cross Fell.

To those who have not seen their method, or heard of it, I shall mention that of the brewers, who throw quick-lime into their large cauldrons when they want to cool them suddenly; and the effect, I apprehend, depends upon similar principles, though exhibited in a different manner: any man, however, may have a cheap proof of the cold produced by evaporation, by plunging his hand into water, and holding it up to the sun or wind, or both, at any season, to dry. Even waving all these as causes of the cold to be expected from vapours, the fogs hovering upon rivers are a sensible proof that the thing is so; which any one must have experienced still more forcibly, who has met with a rainy cloud, or a mere fog, upon the mountains in warm weather, and will have felt that such a cloud, even at a distance, can obtrude a piercing cold upon the warmest day in summer. Now, whether it is by attraction,( which I think it is,) or any thing else, that hills detain clouds which wander in the region of their summits, belongs not to my purpose, since it is a thing known universally to exist wherever there are hills: and Cross Fell, probably from its vast length, height, and loneliness, is peculiarly powerful in detaining them; for it intercepts many, and there is no hill near whose attraction, or effects upon the winds,&amp; c. may serve to remove them: thus they gather not into that shadowy indiscriminate mass of vapours which settle on hills before and during rains, but such as I have described. It will be easily conceived, from what it premised, that such an assembly of vapours will produce a proportional degree of cold around it; whereas the height of any hills in Britain, without such a cause, or a brisk wind, is not sufficient to produce any great degree of it. I have felt a suffocating warmth on the tops of some of the highest of them in a calm day, even when drifts of snow still remained, and were far beneath me. such cold, therefore, must occasion a corresponding density in that portion of air on which it operates; and when the sun, by that more-continued action of his rays which belongs to valleys, has warmed the air in the country beneath in the day, or left it so in the evening, that air must be proportionally rarified; and becoming lighter than that in a higher region, or a least lighter with respect to its situation, the equilibrium which fluids wish to preserve will consequently be interrupted: the higher air will thenceforward rush down to keep up this equilibrium, and in its course occasion the wind of which we are speaking.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Cross Fell",1209,1219],["Britain",1768,1775]],"geonouns":[["water",478,483],["rivers",651,657],["mere",795,799],["mountains",814,823],["hills",1040,1045],["region",1080,1086],["summits",1096,1103],["hills",1198,1203],["hill",1358,1362],["hills",1533,1538],["hills",1759,1764],["valleys",2208,2215],["country",2243,2250],["region",2386,2392]],"pos_words":[["remarkable",73,83],["enough",84,90],["cool",252,256],["sensible",664,672],["warm",827,831],["attraction",981,991],["powerful",1290,1298],["attraction",1374,1384],["brisk",1804,1809],["sufficient",1823,1833],["great",1849,1854],["warmth",1895,1901],["tops",1909,1913],["calm",1950,1954],["lighter",2356,2363],["lighter",2405,2412],["respect",2418,2425]],"neg_words":[["cold",45,49],["cheap",403,408],["cold",422,426],["cold",594,598],["cloud",783,788],["cloud",872,877],["cold",922,926],["loneliness",1264,1274],["peculiarly",1279,1289],["shadowy",1478,1485],["indiscriminate",1486,1500],["cold",1717,1721],["cold",2031,2035]],"events":[],"dates":[["season",539,545],["the warmest day",932,947],["summer",951,957],["day",1955,1958],["the day",2262,2269]],"times":[["the evening",2288,2299]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1188,1193],["there",1346,1351],["without",1777,1784],["left",2274,2278]],"spa_preps":[["into",207,211],["into",473,477],["near",1363,1367],["into",1468,1472],["around",1722,1728],["beneath",2014,2021],["beneath",2251,2258],["down",2563,2567]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0177777778,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9952527285},{"para_id":104,"paragraph":"I believe this account will correspond with all the circumstances attending the Helm Wind of Cross Fell.

The inhabitants of every mountainous tract have greater numbers of them than those of the plains, because their weather is subject to greater and more numerous variations. Pliny has taken notice of many of those signs which were in vogue amongst the Romans; he has, however, done little more than copy them from Virgil: and it is a thing not unworthy our curiosity to observe what a similarity there is between the prognostics of countries so remote from each other; a similarity which, however, proves that they have both been founded on a strict observation of the nature of things, and that they carry along with them not a little of that authority which is due to truth; though we can assign no better reason for many of them at this day, than what Virgil has done in a truly philosophic manner, and the most exquisitely beautiful language.

The Israelites were perhaps the only civilized nation that ever massacred a vanquished enemy in cood blood; nor were they contented with death alone, for they tortured them in the most cruel manner;\" they hewed them to pieces with axes, and tore\" them with harrows.\" It is true, they pretended a divine mandate for this; but what age has not produced some crafty, designing priest, of art and impudence sufficient to gloss over the blackest crimes! The situation of the countries I am here describing is such, that they are extremely beautiful in summer, and equally cold, bleak, and uncomfortable in Winter; and as we know that agriculture has been very lately improved, or even introduced here, we may conclude that the necessities of them were much varied. In summer, the inhabitants would live pleasantly and plentifully enough by hunting and fishing; but in Winter,( before the art of preserving meat by the means of salt was discovered,) their fare must have been very precarious. This would naturally enough introduce the desire of those conveniences their neighbours might chance to enjoy; and among people where legislature is very imperfect, as theirs was till very lately, the next step is plunder. The consequences of these primeval habits are scarcely yet worn out. We find, very late in the annals of history, the inhabitants of these northern counties marked as despising danger to a great degree: most of their ways of speaking of it are ludicrous; and whoever has seen them engaged in their favourite amusement, the Foot Ball, will perceive that even their diversions were hazardous. With all this ferocity, there was, however, a strong tincture of generosity; history, tradition, and the old popular ballads confirm it by numeours instances. Even among the inhabitants of the debateable ground there was a kind of principle of honour mixed with their thefts; for, though outlaws from both kingdoms, and punished with death when taken, they seldom or never did violence to the person of the traveller, and have even been known to do actions of the highest generosity to those whose misfortunes needed such assistance. This is, as far as I can determine, the real character of the northern counties: I shall only add, that the spirit of these people, though changed from its original channel, is not lost; for now it breaks out in obstinate lawsuits, as the learned counsellors who attend this circuit can avouch.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["country",9,16],["countries",889,898],["ground",2224,2230],["channel",2719,2726]],"pos_words":[["mercy",177,182],["protection",188,198],["respect",307,314],["divine",715,721],["sufficient",822,832],["beautiful",953,962],["improved",1081,1089],["pleasantly",1217,1227],["enough",1244,1250],["enough",1427,1433],["enjoy",1510,1515],["great",1818,1823],["strong",2066,2072],["generosity",2085,2095],["popular",2129,2136],["generosity",2492,2502]],"neg_words":[["enemy",133,138],["death",379,384],["enemy",506,511],["death",556,561],["tortured",578,586],["cruel",604,609],["crafty",775,781],["impudence",812,821],["cold",986,990],["bleak",992,997],["uncomfortable",1003,1016],["precarious",1394,1404],["imperfect",1560,1569],["plunder",1620,1627],["scarcely",1675,1683],["worn",1688,1692],["danger",1806,1812],["ludicrous",1873,1882],["hazardous",2009,2018],["ferocity",2034,2042],["death",2354,2359],["lost",2735,2739],["breaks",2752,2758],["obstinate",2766,2775]],"events":[],"dates":[["that day",218,226],["summer",966,972],["Winter",1020,1026],["summer",1182,1188],["Winter",1282,1288]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",904,908],["here",1110,1114],["there",2044,2049],["there",2231,2236]],"spa_preps":[["over",842,846],["among",1521,1526],["out",1693,1696],["among",2184,2189],["out",2759,2762]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0341880342,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9968275428},{"para_id":164,"paragraph":"Near to Emont Bridge is Mayburgh, or Maybrough, a singular and astonishing piece of antiquity, nothing similar to it appearing either in this or any other country that I can hear of.

And so we rode thither one night, and coming a little after sun-rising, they who\" saw us coming barred their gates and kept their dykes; for the town is dyked on\" both sides, with a gate to the wall's - ward, and a gate to the over-end, and to the fell-ward;\" there we lited on foot, and gave the town a sharp onset and assault, and slew\" one honest man in the town with an arrow; in so much, that one wife came to the\" dyke, and called for one that would take her husband and save his life. Anthony\" Armstrong being ready, said,\" Fetch him to me, and I'll warrant his life.\" The woman\" ran into the town and fetched her husband, and brought him through the\" dyke, and delivered him to the said Armstrong, who brought him into England and\" ransomed him. The tutor of Bombye, near adjoining the said town, impeached us\" with a company of men, and so we drew from the town and gave Bombye the onset,\" where were slain, of our part, Clement Taylor; of theirs three, and divers taken, the\" rest fled. And so we returned, seized about 2000 sheep, 200 kye and oxen, 40 or 50\" horses, mares, and colts, and brought the same towards Dumfries. The country beyond\" the water of Dee gathered and came to a place called the Forehead Ford, so we\" left all our sheep, and put our worst-horsed men before our nowte and naggs, and\" sent 30 of the best horsed to preeke at the scots if they should come over the water,\" and I to abide with the standard in their relief; which the scots perceiving, stayed\" and came not over, so that we passed that night to Dumfries, leaving the goods in\" safety with men and a good watch. In the morning we repaired to the goods, a\" mile beyond Dumfires, of intent to have divided and dealt the booty; and some\" claimed this cow and that nagg under assurance, and ran through the goods. Above\" all, one man of the laird of Empsfielde came amongst the goods, and would\" need take one cow, and would be stopped by no man, insomuch, that one Thomas\" Taylor, called Tom with the Bow,--\" so that the blood ran down over his shoulders. Going to his master there, and crying\" out, his master went with him to the master Maxwell; the master Maxwell came\" with a great rout after him, and brought the man with the bloody head to me, saying\" with an earnest countenance,\" Is this, think ye, well, both to take our goods and\" thus to shed our blood?\" I considering the master at present to be two for one,\" thought best to use him and the rest of the scots with good words and fair speeches,\" for they were determined to have even there given us an onset, and to have made\" that their quarrel; so I persuaded him and the rest to stay themselves, and for the\" man that hurt the other man, he should be punished to the example of all others to\" commit the like, giving him that gave the stroke sharp words before them, and the\" goods should all be stayed, and none dealt till the next morrow, and then every man\" to come that had any claim, and, upon proof, it should be redressed; and thus witted\" every man quietly for that time to depart. Upon this we all agreed, and so we left\" the goods in safe keeping to come to Dumfries about one of the clock in the\" afternoon, giving every one of the garrison secret orders to put on their sacks,\" and bridle and saddle their horses, and meet me immediately at the bridge, and\" so they did. I sent 42 men for the goods, and to meet me at a ford a mile above\" the town where we brought the goods over, and so came by Lochmahen and\" divided them that night, and brought them to Cannonby, where we remained before;\" and thus with wiles we beguiled the scots.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["England",406,413],["Moot Hall",472,481],["England",523,530],["England",876,883],["Galloway",1020,1028],["Dumfries",1106,1114],["England",1965,1972],["Dumfries",2363,2371],["Ford",2459,2463],["Dumfries",2778,2786],["Dumfries",4362,4370]],"geonouns":[["road",26,30],["walls",112,117],["falls",150,155],["lake",166,170],["houses",174,180],["town",1067,1071],["town",1197,1201],["gates",1347,1352],["town",1383,1387],["gate",1420,1424],["wall",1432,1436],["gate",1453,1457],["foot",1516,1520],["town",1535,1539],["town",1599,1603],["town",1838,1842],["town",2037,2041],["town",2104,2108],["country",2377,2384],["water",2397,2402],["water",2633,2638],["head",3467,3471],["bridge",4551,4557],["town",4649,4653]],"pos_words":[["great",56,61],["sharp",1542,1547],["honest",1581,1587],["ready",1755,1760],["best",2569,2573],["relief",2683,2689],["good",2832,2836],["assurance",3004,3013],["master",3298,3304],["master",3333,3339],["master",3361,3367],["master",3381,3387],["great",3409,3414],["earnest",3495,3502],["well",3536,3540],["master",3613,3619],["best",3659,3663],["good",3706,3710],["fair",3721,3725],["like",3998,4002],["sharp",4036,4041],["safe",4338,4342]],"neg_words":[["sore",262,266],["peril",632,637],["refused",1116,1123],["burn",1228,1232],["fell",1486,1490],["assault",1558,1565],["worst",2504,2509],["bloody",3460,3466],["quarrel",3829,3836],["hurt",3912,3916],["wiles",4813,4818]],"events":[],"dates":[["The first day",2,15],["the\"",242,246],["morrow",425,431],["about ten days",741,755],["the\"",1062,1066],["the\"",1653,1657],["the\"",1892,1896],["the\"",2219,2223],["50",2304,2306],["30",2559,2561],["the\"",3898,3902],["the\"",4065,4069],["morrow",4127,4133],["the\"",4397,4401],["42",4584,4586]],"times":[["that night",83,93],["one night",1261,1270],["that night",2764,2774],["the morning",2847,2858],["afternoon",4402,4411],["that night",4730,4740]],"distances":[["24 miles",1092,1100],["mile",2888,2892],["a mile",4631,4637]],"loc_advs":[["there",236,241],["there",331,336],["hither",448,454],["there",1498,1503],["left",2472,2476],["there",3305,3310],["there",3775,3780],["left",4319,4323],["above",4638,4643]],"spa_preps":[["into",31,35],["into",463,467],["over",1465,1469],["into",1829,1833],["through",1884,1891],["into",1960,1964],["near",2013,2017],["about",2262,2267],["beyond",2385,2391],["over",2624,2628],["over",2740,2744],["beyond",2893,2899],["under",2998,3003],["through",3023,3030],["amongst",3094,3101],["down",3260,3264],["over",3265,3269],["out",3324,3327],["about",4371,4376],["over",4681,4685]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0219560878,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9452094436},{"para_id":182,"paragraph":"\" Considering Cannonby to be far from the enemy, for at that time all Annerdale,\" Liddisdale, and a great part both of Nidsdale and Galloway were in assurance,\" and entered to serve the King's Majesty of England, saving the laird of Drumlanricke,\" who never came in nor submitted himself, and with him continued Alexander\" Carlell laird of Bridekirk, and his son the young laird; I thought it good\" to practice some way that we might get some hold or castle where we might lie\" near the enemy, and to lie within our own strength in the night, where we might\" all lie down together and all rise together. Thus practising, one sander Armstrong\" son to ill Will.

But about a dozen of men got over the barnekin-wall,\" and stole close into the house within the barnekin, took the wenches, and\" kept them secure till day-light. And at sun-rising, two men and a woman being in\" the tower, one of the men rising in his shirt, and going to the tower-head, and seeing\" nothing stir about, he called on the wench that lay in the tower, and bad her\" rise and open the door, and call up them that lay beneath. she so doing, and opening\" the iron door, and a wood without it, our men within the barnekin brake a little\" too soon to the door, for the wench perceiving them, leaped back into the tower\" and had gotten almost the wood door to, but one got hold of it that she could not\" get it close to: so the skirmish rose, and we over the barnekin and broke open the\" wood door, and she being troubled with the wood door, left the iron door open; and\" so we entered and wan the Loughwood, where we truly found the house well provided\" for beef salted, malt, big, havermeal, bread and cheese.

These calamities, joined to a want of water, and great distance from coal,( the nearest being 26 miles land-carriage,) made this town very thin of inhabitants: but in the year 1748, Bishop strickland of Carlisle remedied the former of these wants, by purchasing of the owners of certain Mills,( particularly Vaux of Catterlin,) so much of the water of the River Petterell as would flow through the eye of a mill-stone. This he generously, at his own expence, conveyed to Penrith, and the water still continues to flow in the same quantity, and no more. since the general use of pumps, no town perhaps is better supplied with water; scarce any house being so inconsiderable as not to be provided with one of those useful engines.","file_id":"1787_a","plnames":[["Penrith",13,20],["Cumberland",145,155],["Penrith,",198,206],["Carlisle",1083,1091],["River",1236,1241],["Penrith,",1351,1359]],"geonouns":[["town",5,9],["villages",226,234],["head",405,409],["town",589,593],["walls",671,676],["houses",686,692],["house",809,814],["water",918,923],["land",983,987],["carriage",988,996],["town",1009,1013],["water",1223,1228],["stone",1292,1297],["water",1368,1373],["town",1468,1472],["water",1505,1510],["house",1523,1528]],"pos_words":[["useful",298,304],["great",929,934],["generously",1307,1317],["better",1484,1490],["useful",1593,1599]],"neg_words":[["suffered",48,56],["waste",164,169],["weak",475,479],["killed",718,724],["calamities",886,896],["scarce",1512,1518]],"events":[],"dates":[["19",106,108],["6.",516,518],["Ii.",533,536],["the year 1748",1047,1060]],"times":[],"distances":[["26 miles",974,982]],"loc_advs":[["there",324,329],["left",776,780],["there",781,786]],"spa_preps":[["away",244,248],["into",305,309],["away",736,740],["down",832,836],["through",1266,1273]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0070422535,"vader_sentiment":0.88,"roberta_sentiment":0.9498143196},{"para_id":241,"paragraph":"After the Bishop's patriotic exertion, the town continued to increase till the year 1598, when the plague almost depopulated it; since that time, it has flourished gradually, and seems likely to increase.
