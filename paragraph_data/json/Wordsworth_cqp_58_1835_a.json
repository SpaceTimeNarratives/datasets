Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing to its greater size, to the islands, and to its having two vales at the head, with their accompanying mountains of nearly equal dignity. Nor can the grandeur of these two terminations be seen at once from any point, except from the bosom of the Lake. The Islands may be explored at any time of the day; but one bright unruffled evening, must, if possible, be set apart for the splendour, the stillness, and solemnity of a three hour's voyage upon the higher division of the Lake, no omitting, towards the end of the excursion, to quit the expanse of water, and peep into the close and calm River at the head; which, in its quiet character, at such a time, appears rather like an overflow of the peaceful Lake itself, than to have any more immediate connection with the rough mountains whence it has descended, or the turbulent torrents by which it is supplied.

Matterdale, though a wild and interesting spot, has no peculiar features that would make it worth the Stranger's while to go in search of them; but, in Gowbarrow Park, the lover of Nature might linger for hours. Here is a powerful Brook, which dashes among rocks through a deep glen, hung on every side with a rich and happy intermixture of native wood; here are beds of luxuriant fern, aged hawthorns, and hollies decked with honeysuckles; and fallow-deer glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets. These are the attractions of the retired views, or constitute a foreground for ever-varying pictures of the majestic Lake, forced to take a winding course by bold promontories, and environed by mountains of sublime form, towering above each other. At the outlet of Gowbarrow Park, we reach a third stream, which flows through a little recess called Glencoin, where lurks a single house, yet visible from the road. Let the Artist or leisurely Traveller turn aside to it, for the buildings and objects around them are romantic and picturesque. Having passed under the steeps of Styebarrow Crag, and the remains of its native woods, at Glenridding Bridge, a fourth stream is crossed.","file_id":"1835_a","plnames":[["Dalemain",3,11],["Penrith,",36,44],["Dacre",76,81],["Dacor",86,91],["Eamont",207,213],["Penruddock",266,276],["Hutton John",351,362],["Dacre Castle",367,379],["Dalemain",501,509],["Dacre Castle",511,523],["Matterdale",781,791],["Matterdale",811,821],["Gowbarrow Park",963,977],["Gowbarrow Park",1596,1610],["Glencoin",1680,1688],["Styebarrow Crag",1907,1922],["Glenridding Bridge",1964,1982]],"geonouns":[["stream",161,167],["mansions",339,347],["fields",489,495],["summit",546,552],["stream",647,653],["glen",675,679],["valley",683,689],["rocks",1068,1073],["glen",1089,1093],["wood",1159,1163],["beds",1174,1178],["lawns",1299,1304],["winding",1471,1478],["promontories",1494,1506],["mountains",1525,1534],["outlet",1586,1592],["stream",1629,1635],["house",1711,1716],["road",1739,1743],["buildings",1809,1818],["woods",1954,1959],["stream",1993,1999]],"pos_words":[["soft",291,295],["pleasantly",395,405],["grand",614,619],["worthy",690,696],["leads",742,747],["interesting",841,852],["worth",903,908],["lover",983,988],["powerful",1033,1041],["rich",1121,1125],["happy",1130,1135],["luxuriant",1182,1191],["majestic",1439,1447],["sublime",1538,1545],["romantic",1847,1855],["picturesque",1860,1871]],"neg_words":[["bore",107,111],["gloomy",447,453],["jagged",539,545],["wild",832,836],["peculiar",866,874],["hung",1095,1099]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["hours",1016,1021]],"distances":[["about three miles",13,30],["a mile",214,220]],"loc_advs":[["near",496,500],["here",1165,1169],["above",1561,1566],["aside",1788,1793]],"spa_preps":[["below",221,226],["about",260,265],["down",284,288],["into",776,780],["among",1062,1067],["through",1074,1081],["over",1290,1294],["through",1309,1316],["through",1649,1656],["around",1831,1837],["under",1887,1892]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0546448087,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9974545836},{"para_id":46,"paragraph":"The opening on the side of Ullswater Vale, down which this Stream flows, is adorned with fertile fields, cottages, and natural groves, that agreeably unite with the transverse views of the Lake; and the Stream, if followed up after the enclosures are left behind, will lead along bold water-breaks and waterfalls to a silent Tarn in the recesses of Helvellyn. This desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles, that built in the precipice that forms its western barrier. These birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the solitary angler. It also derives a meloncholy interest from the fate of a young man, a stranger, who perished some years ago, by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to Grasmere. His remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months, self-supported, and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master. But to return to the road in the main Vale of Ullswater. - At the head of the Lake( being now in Patterdale) we cross a fifth Stream, Grisdale Beck: this would conduct through a woody steep, where there may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies, up to the level area of the Valley of Grisdale; hence there is a path for foot-travellers, and along which a horse may be led, to Grasmere. A sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending the bed of this valley, and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately under the projecting masses of Helvellyn. Having retraced the banks of the Stream to Patterdale, and pursued the road up the main Dale, the next considerable stream would, if ascended in the same manner, conduct to Deep Dale, the character of which valley may be conjectured from its name. It is terminated by a cove, a craggy and gloomy abyss, with precipitous sides; a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it, by the west wind, from the summit of Fairfield. Lastly, having gone along the western side of Brotherswater and passed Hartsop Hall, a Stream soon issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood. This spot is, I believe, never explored by Travellers; but, from these sylvan and rocky recesses, whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of Brotherswater, or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of Dove Crag, etc., will be equally pleased with the beauty, the grandeur, and the wildness of the scenery.","file_id":"1835_a","plnames":[["Ullswater Vale",27,41],["Helvellyn",349,358],["Grasmere",713,721],["Ullswater",974,983],["Patterdale",1025,1035],["Grisdale Beck",1062,1075],["Grisdale",1219,1227],["Grasmere",1311,1319],["Helvellyn",1517,1526],["Patterdale",1571,1581],["Fairfield",1952,1961],["Brotherswater",2009,2022],["Hartsop Hall",2034,2046],["Brotherswater",2260,2273],["Dove Crag",2331,2340]],"geonouns":[["fields",97,103],["cottages",105,113],["groves",127,133],["water",285,290],["waterfalls",302,312],["precipice",429,438],["head",517,521],["rocks",675,680],["road",949,953],["head",994,998],["path",1246,1250],["foot",1255,1259],["mountain",1346,1354],["bed",1398,1401],["valley",1410,1416],["path",1456,1460],["banks",1548,1553],["road",1599,1603],["stream",1644,1650],["valley",1735,1741],["cove",1798,1802],["summit",1942,1948],["cove",2076,2080],["wood",2110,2114],["ridges",2321,2327]],"pos_words":[["fertile",89,96],["agreeably",140,149],["lead",269,273],["silent",318,324],["faithful",765,773],["supported",837,846],["master",920,926],["led",1303,1306],["sublime",1323,1330],["leads",1461,1466],["faithful",1857,1865],["richly",2081,2087],["pleased",2364,2371],["beauty",2381,2387],["grandeur",2393,2401]],"neg_words":[["breaks",291,297],["desolate",365,373],["stranger",616,624],["falling",658,665],["steep",1112,1117],["unusually",1148,1157],["gloomy",1817,1823],["abyss",1824,1829],["precipitous",1836,1847],["issues",2062,2068],["rocky",2198,2203],["precipitous",2293,2304]],"events":[],"dates":[["some years ago",639,653],["three months",818,830]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",251,255],["behind",256,262],["here",796,800],["there",1125,1130],["there",1235,1240],["forward",2278,2285]],"spa_preps":[["down",43,47],["along",274,279],["round",507,512],["down",666,670],["over",705,709],["through",1096,1103],["along",1276,1281],["under",1486,1491],["into",1906,1910],["along",1983,1988]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0138248848,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987934828},{"para_id":47,"paragraph":"Seven Glens or Vallies have been noticed, which branch off from the Cumberland side of the Vale. The opposite side has only Streams of any importance, one of which would lead up from the point where it crosses the Kirkstone Road, near the foot of Brotherswater, to the decaying hamlet of Hartsop, remarkable for its cottage architecture, and thence to Haywater, much frequented by anglers. The other, coming down Martindale, enters Ullswater at sandwyke, opposite to Gowbarrow Park. No persons but such as come to Patterdale, merely to pass through it, should fail to walk as far as Blowick, the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the Lake. The axe has here indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks, that divided this favoured spot into a hundred pictures. It has yet it land-locked bays, and rocky promontories; but those beautiful woods are gone, which perfected its seclusion; and scenes, that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible volume, are now spread before the eye in a single sheet, - magnificent indeed, but seemingly perused in a moment! From Blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of Place Fell, richly adorned with juniper, and sprinkled over with birches, to the village of Sandwyke, a few straggling houses, that with the small estates attached to them, occupy an opening opposite to Lyulph's Tower and Gowbarrow Park. In Martindale, the road loses sight of the Lake, and leads over a steep hill, bringing you again into view of Ullswater. Its lowest reach, four miles in length, is before you; and the view terminated by the long ridge of Cross Fell in the distance. Immediately under the eye is a deep-indented bay, with a plot of fertile land, transversed by a small brook, and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented and showy appearence than is usual in those wild spots.","file_id":"1835_a","plnames":[["Cumberland",68,78],["Kirkstone",214,223],["Brotherswater",247,260],["Hartsop",288,295],["Haywater",352,360],["Martindale",413,423],["Ullswater",432,441],["Gowbarrow Park",467,481],["Patterdale",514,524],["Blowick",583,590],["Blowick",1117,1124],["Place Fell",1174,1184],["Sandwyke",1266,1274],["Lyulph's Tower",1377,1391],["Gowbarrow Park",1396,1410],["Martindale",1415,1425],["Ullswater",1522,1531],["Cross Fell",1633,1643]],"geonouns":[["point",187,192],["foot",239,243],["hamlet",278,284],["cottage",316,323],["pass",536,540],["land",610,614],["wood",721,725],["land",818,822],["bays",830,834],["promontories",846,858],["woods",880,885],["track",1134,1139],["village",1255,1262],["houses",1293,1299],["road",1431,1435],["hill",1484,1488],["ridge",1624,1629],["bay",1706,1709],["land",1734,1738],["brook",1763,1768],["houses",1820,1826]],"pos_words":[["lead",170,174],["remarkable",297,307],["rich",716,720],["beautiful",870,879],["magnificent",1057,1068],["richly",1186,1192],["leads",1465,1470],["fertile",1726,1733],["cheerful",1783,1791]],"neg_words":[["fail",560,564],["indiscriminately",688,704],["rocky",840,845],["loses",1436,1441],["steep",1478,1483],["plot",1718,1722],["wild",1892,1896]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["four miles",1551,1561]],"loc_advs":[["near",230,234],["opposite",455,463],["here",683,687]],"spa_preps":[["opposite",101,109],["down",408,412],["through",541,548],["into",779,783],["along",1149,1154],["over",1229,1233],["opposite",1365,1373],["over",1471,1475],["into",1509,1513],["under",1673,1678]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0119047619,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9823063016},{"para_id":48,"paragraph":"From Pooley Bridge, at the foot of the Lake, Haweswater may be conveniently visited.
