Water is the richest feature of natural scenery. When spread out in ample sheets, and especially when fringed by wood, sprinkled with islands, and embosomed in the depth of valleys, the mirrored surface is itself most grateful to the eye, and sets off every other beauty of the landscape. The towering crag or mountain looks still bolder when rising from the smooth sheet of the lake; the crisped foliage of the wood, and the emerald carpet of the field or knoll, have their colours heightened, and their outline more distinctly traced, from contrast with the silvery expause. The water reflects the tints of the hill and the azure face of heaven. It sweeps gracefully round bays and promontories, and' clips ing the islands as with a loving embrace.

The rarity of lake and mountain scenery in this country adds greatly to its charm in the eyes of the English tourist. Now would I rank the lakes of England far below those of any other country in point of beauty. It is true that many of the Swiss and Italian lakes are of much larger dimensions, and the mountains are precipices by which they are environed are several times more lofty. In point of sublimity, therefore, our native lakes are greatly surpassed; yet even in this quality the superiority of the Alpine lakes is by no means so striking as their magnitude might lead us to suppose. Beyond a certain point, increased size produces but a comparatively small addition of effect, owing to the limited powers of human vision. Among the Alps, too, the magnitudes of all the objects are proportionate, and they are consequently the less striking to the spectator. So much do the mountains and lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland exceed the other parts of this country in grandeur, that they would unquestionably appear more astonishing to Englishmen in general, than Switzerland seen after having visited the Lakes. The continental traveller may even return from the Oberland of Berne and the valley of Chamouni, and still visit this delightful part of our native country with high admiration. Such views as that of Scawfell Pikes, seen from the platform of Styhead,-- the Old Man, from the surface of Coniston Water,-- Langdale Pikes, from the head of Langdale,-- cannot fail to impress the mind with mingled awe and transport. In one important feature our native lakes surpass those of Switzerland and Italy, namely, in their islands.

The atmosphere is then also clearer than in an advanced period of autumn, when morning and evening mists begin to prevail. On the other hand, the woods and mountains are seen in the glory in September and October, when the foliage is enriched and variegated with the autumnal tints, and when the hills, assuming a warm brown from the sun-baked fern which covers them, or a bright purple from the innumerable bells which deck the heather, are contrasted with the yet brilliant green of the valleys. The evening skies, too, are now more glowing than at any other period of the year. On the whole, therefore, the landscape is more rich and diversified in the advanced part of the season, and the painter would certainly choose this time for visiting the Lakes,-- putting up with the inconveniences of shortened days and cool evenings.

A party of gentlemen might find it more agreeable to travel on horseback, not merely for the sake of the exercise, but from the greater independence the rider enjoys, and the power he possesses of taking his horse over tracks which a carriage could not traverse. Those who have time, health, vigour, and a disposition to enjoy rambling, will find a pedestrian excursion the most agreeable: they will thus be more independent even than the horseman, and may deviate at pleasure from the beaten track, to climb the rocks, explore the woods, roam from mountain to mountain, cross from valley to valley, sketch, or collect specimens.

This plan, whilst it allows great freedom of motion, affords the pleasure both of foot and horse exercise, diminishes fatigue, saves times, and enables the travellers to convey by saddle-bags or valise the small stock of clothes they may need in those excursions in which they are distant from the principal towns,-- the coaches serving to convey a trunk or portmanteau from one town to another. I do not recommend solitary rambling, if pleasure be the object. I have tried it, and found it dull and wearisome. A friend to whom you can express the feelings which the beautiful and sublime of nature excite, whose gratification you can at once partake and enhance by sympathy, and with whom you can converse when there are no objects demanding attention, will increase tenfold the pleasure of the tour.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["carriage",70,78],["country",222,229],["carriage",260,268],["tracks",569,575],["carriage",584,592],["track",843,848],["rocks",863,868],["woods",882,887],["mountain",899,907],["mountain",911,919],["valley",932,938],["valley",942,948],["foot",1217,1221],["coaches",1456,1463],["town",1514,1518]],"pos_words":[["convenient",110,120],["better",230,236],["protection",299,309],["agreeable",390,399],["enjoys",509,515],["enjoy",671,676],["agreeable",729,738],["pleasure",818,826],["agreeably",1075,1084],["great",1163,1168],["freedom",1169,1176],["pleasure",1200,1208],["recommend",1540,1549],["pleasure",1572,1580],["beautiful",1702,1711],["sublime",1716,1723],["excite",1734,1740],["gratification",1748,1761],["enhance",1790,1797],["pleasure",1915,1923]],"neg_words":[["deviate",807,814],["fatigue",1253,1260],["object",1588,1594],["dull",1626,1630],["wearisome",1635,1644]],"events":[],"dates":[["towns,--",1443,1451]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1847,1852]],"spa_preps":[["against",310,317],["over",564,568]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0943396226,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977405071},{"para_id":36,"paragraph":"I may be excused for hinting, as the conclusion of this introductory chapter, that the pleasure of travelling depends at least as much upon the state of a man's mind as on the objects he beholds.

It would disarrange all their plans; winter would be coming on; Mrs. Anabella's engagements with different Institutions, of which she was a member, would not admit of it; Matilda's Italian lessons would be interrupted; it was incompatible with George's business; above all, the Musical Festival would take place at the beginning of October, and they should need a month to prepare for it: in short, the whole party with one voice reiterated taht the thing was on every count quite out of the range of possibility. It would have availed little to urge any thing about the greater mildness of the season, the mellower tints of autumn,&amp; c. &amp; c., and I therefore called in aid my second proposition-- the Lancaster Assizes. None of them had ever been at an Assize, and I saw instantly that their curiosity was stimulated. Mrs. Anabella, you must know, has been a passionate admirer of Mr. Brougham ever since he said some very civil things to her at Liverpool, when he was candidate for that town in 1812: she has a wonderful veneration for his eloquence, and she thinks him the most agreeable gentleman in the world into the bargain. She went to hear his speech at the dinner given to him not long since in our Music Hall; and she was amongst the first to dart into the Orchestra, long before the gentlemen were at liberty to lift their eyes from the substantial banquet before them to the feast of beauty prepared for them on the sideboard. I need hardly add, that the idea of seeing and hearing her great favourite at Lancaster went fast and far towards cutting down the impossibilities which had previously been urged. My cousin Madge, who is a shrewd girl, with not much romance about her, but a quiz, and a lover of the droll and comical, was excessively curious to see how some young barristers of her acquaintance looked in wigs and gowns. She had never seen Mr. Brougham, but, having heard rather more of him than she liked from her aunt, I believe she had a spiteful desire to see him, suspecting that he was not the all-perfect being Mrs. Anabella described, and quite prepared, like the Athenian, to vote him an ostracism, merely because she was tired of hearing his praises. George, though one of the best-natured beings in the world, is very romantic and bashful, and he therefore vigorously opposed the postponement of his ramble amongst the Lakes, and deprecated the idea of appearing in a crowded court, where he should probably have to suffer several introductions, and to listen to very tedious trials. However, his pliability and want of self-confidence induced him soon to yield to our persuations, which he did the more readily as he knew that it was in vain to oppose his aunt in any thing on which she had set her mind. It is true that the ladies themselves wavered betwixt the immediate enjoyment offered by their own plan, and the higher though later entertainment proposed by mind; but after a long, grave, and anxious discussion, the amendment was put to the vote, and carried by a decided majority.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Lancaster",176,185],["George",729,735],["Lancaster",1194,1203],["Assize",1246,1252],["Brougham",1378,1386],["Liverpool",1439,1448],["Lancaster",2010,2019],["Brougham",2360,2368],["George",2677,2683],["Lakes",2846,2851]],"geonouns":[["town",1481,1485]],"pos_words":[["instantly",1264,1273],["passionate",1352,1362],["admirer",1363,1370],["wonderful",1505,1514],["eloquence",1534,1543],["agreeable",1573,1582],["bargain",1615,1622],["liberty",1805,1812],["beauty",1889,1895],["great",1991,1996],["fast",2025,2029],["lover",2202,2207],["liked",2416,2421],["perfect",2520,2527],["like",2579,2583],["best",2703,2707],["romantic",2745,2753],["confidence",3052,3062],["readily",3131,3138],["enjoyment",3301,3310]],"neg_words":[["incompatible",711,723],["comical",2225,2232],["excessively",2238,2249],["spiteful",2457,2465],["tired",2647,2652],["bashful",2758,2765],["crowded",2895,2902],["suffer",2943,2949],["tedious",2995,3002],["vain",3165,3169],["oppose",3173,3179],["anxious",3427,3434]],"events":[],"dates":[["autumn",124,130],["two or three days",204,221],["July",416,420],["the beginning of September",457,483],["winter",522,528],["the beginning of October",800,824],["a month",847,854],["the season",1076,1086],["1812",1489,1493]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["above",748,753],["out",966,969],["about",1046,1051],["into",1606,1610],["amongst",1725,1732],["into",1751,1755],["down",2054,2058],["about",2173,2178],["amongst",2834,2841]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0264900662,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9975017905},{"para_id":44,"paragraph":"However interesting the detail, it would occupy too much time to mention particularly all our deep deliberations, extensive purchases, and laborious preparations before setting out for the north. Suffice it to say, that we had every thing ready at least a month before our departure, and that we settled our affairs as though we were about to circumnavigate the globe. At length, in the middle of the Assizes,( for which I had with difficulty prevailed upon them not to set off the first day,) we quitted Liverpool, after a sleepless night, at eight o'clock in the morning. It was resolved that, though we were to make a short stay in Preston, we should not dine till we arrived at Lancaster; and never party formed such a resolve with less danger of perishing from inanition. What with our own foresight and that of the housekeeper, we had a far greater quantity of eatables and drinkables than the pockets of the carriage would hold; and, after leaving many things behind, we found ourselves entrenched to the teeth in cakes, sandwiches, wine, glasses, maps, fans, reticules, guide-books, note-books, and lead pencils. We had also provided a pocket compass, whereby to steer our course; and I afterwards found that George had secreted a pair of pistols in the hinder part of the carriage, to defend us against robbers; though to be prudently refrained from mentioning this to the ladies, who would have been as much frightened by the contiguity of such weapons as by an actual attack of highwaymen. It had been thought advisable to procure a roomy travelling chariot without a barouche seat, in order that we might have the fullest possible view of the country in front and on each side; but this was attended with the inconvenience, that one of the party was obliged to sit bodkin. Matilda, George, and myself took this enviable post of precedence in turns; but as Matilda loved comfort more than glory, and as I had rather too much length of leg to be easy in that situation, we contrived to let George have considerably the longest turn. He, to be sure, was not at all shorter in limb than myself, but, being more eager to see the country, he was content to endure the constraint. When we got amongst the hills, however, he soon gave us leg bail; he walked up all the steep ascents, and often stretched on for several miles. He annoyed his aunt and sister by climbing rocks and hills out of the road for the sake of a view, which obliged us to wait for him; and sometimes we were even alarmed for his safety, as he has a most extraordinary proneness to get into awkward predicaments.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Liverpool",505,514],["Preston",635,642],["Lancaster",682,691],["George",1217,1223],["George",1794,1800],["George",2000,2006]],"geonouns":[["carriage",915,923],["carriage",1281,1289],["seat",1588,1592],["country",1655,1662],["post",1832,1836],["country",2136,2143],["hills",2210,2215],["rocks",2373,2378],["hills",2383,2388],["road",2400,2404]],"pos_words":[["interesting",8,19],["ready",239,244],["foresight",795,804],["fans",1061,1065],["lead",1107,1111],["prudently",1334,1343],["roomy",1544,1549],["enviable",1823,1831],["loved",1876,1881],["comfort",1882,1889],["glory",1900,1905],["easy",1956,1960],["eager",2119,2124],["extraordinary",2531,2544]],"neg_words":[["difficulty",432,442],["danger",741,747],["hinder",1262,1268],["attack",1479,1485],["inconvenience",1721,1734],["contrived",1983,1992],["steep",2273,2278],["annoyed",2333,2340],["alarmed",2490,2497],["awkward",2567,2574]],"events":[],"dates":[["at least a month",245,261],["the middle of the",383,400],["the first day",478,491]],"times":[["night",534,539],["eight o'clock in the morning",544,572]],"distances":[["several miles",2315,2328]],"loc_advs":[["without",1569,1576]],"spa_preps":[["out",177,180],["about",334,339],["behind",967,973],["against",1304,1311],["amongst",2198,2205],["out",2389,2392],["into",2562,2566]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0183486239,"vader_sentiment":0.93,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9982603192},{"para_id":45,"paragraph":"The morning was propitous.

We admired the grotesque appearance of the old church at Ormskirk, in which a slim spire stands close by the side of a massive square tower. The church, as Mrs. Anabella informed us, was built at the expense of two maiden ladies, one of whom preferred a tower and the other a spire; and as neither would give up her favourite idea, they agreed to erect both a tower and a spire side by side. Such at least is the tradition which has descended through many centuries. The church contains the burial-place of the Stanleys.

Rufford Old Hall, which is built with a wooden front, curiously painted in stripes of black and white, and with some dozen gable ends like pigeon-cotes, was long the seat of the Hesketh family; but Sir Thomas has built a new hall, in the modern style, at a short distance from it, where he resides. About ten miles from Preston, we had a good view of the Ribble, where it expands into a broad estuary, and the village of Lytham may be seen on the opposite bank. The approach to Preston is interesting. The old low mansion of Penwortham Hall stands on a steep grassy bank overlooking the valley of the Ribble, which forms a noble sweep round the south side of the town. The valley is luxuriant and beautiful; the woods of Walton Hall are seen to the right, and beyond rises the hill which is crowned with the ancient seat of Hoghton Tower: both of these mansions belong to Sir Harry Hoghton. Preston stands on a gentle elevation at the north of the river, and looks a handsome town as seen in the descent of Penwortham hill.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Preston",825,832],["Preston",983,990],["Preston",1396,1403]],"geonouns":[["passes",138,144],["forces",279,285],["house",309,314],["seat",445,449],["seat",671,675],["hall",730,734],["estuary",898,905],["village",915,922],["bank",961,965],["mansion",1019,1026],["bank",1071,1075],["valley",1092,1098],["town",1168,1172],["valley",1178,1184],["woods",1217,1222],["hill",1282,1286],["seat",1321,1325],["mansions",1358,1366],["river",1453,1458],["town",1481,1485],["hill",1523,1527]],"pos_words":[["right",32,37],["gallantly",216,225],["heroic",242,248],["modern",387,393],["like",639,643],["modern",743,749],["good",843,847],["interesting",994,1005],["noble",1128,1133],["luxuriant",1188,1197],["beautiful",1202,1211],["right",1254,1259],["gentle",1416,1422],["handsome",1472,1480]],"neg_words":[["ruined",321,327],["steep",1058,1063]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["Two miles",0,9],["About ten miles",804,819]],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[["within",145,151],["against",267,274],["into",885,889],["opposite",952,960],["round",1140,1145],["beyond",1265,1271]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0833333333,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":0.7019076943},{"para_id":47,"paragraph":"\" Proud Preston\" is less deserving of its title now than it was before the late extraordinary increase of its manufactures, which, though they have added greatly to its wealth and population, have impaired its aristocratic claim to peculiar gentility.

I could not have wished for a clearer or brighter day, to show them this view, which possesses nearly every feature of a perfect landscape. The hill on which the castle stands rises abruptly in the midst of the vale of the Lune, and commands a complete panoramic view of the country. The river is seen winding round the foot of the hill, and may be traced up the valley as far as the aqueduct, and, in the opposite direction, to the sea. Just below the town it expands into a broad estuary, which makes a sweeping bend through the valley, and at high water has a noble effect. Looking northward and beyond the Lune, the eye beholds the whole of the extensive Bay of Morcecambe, running several miles inland, and the white houses of Ulverston, at the distance of fourteen or fifteen miles, on the opposite shore. The fine wooded estuaries of the Kent and the Leven penetrate the northern shore of the Bay, and give it a richly picturesque effect. Rising beyond the Bay is the whole range of the Westmoreland and Cumberland mountains-- the ultimate object of our expedition. To the left, nearest the sea, is the regular and rounded yet high mountain of Black Comb, said to command one of the most extensive views of any hill in England; and further inland springs up the loftier and more rugged cluster of Scawfell and his neighbouring heights, which, as well as the range of Helvellyn, further still to the right, display the pointed and irregular forms common to high mountains. I thought George would have gazed his eyes out at this splendid view of the mountains whih he had been so eager to behold: the sun, resting upon them, showed their barren sides and bold summits to great advantage, and the slight degree of indistinctness and softening which their remoteness occasioned, gave them an almost unearthly and perfectly fascinating appearance to one who saw them for the first time. Turning eastward, the eye follows a long chain of hills till it rests on the broad head of Ingleborough, the prince of Yorkshire mountains, rearing his enormous bulk over the upper extremity of the vale of the Lune. The vale itself is fertile and beautiful, highly adorned by the winding stream, and by a majestic aqueduct which carries the canal across it by five lofty arches, at the distance of a mile and a half from the town.

This court is plain, sombre, and rather incommodious; the\" dim judicial light\" shed into it through windows overtopped by the spike-surmounted walls of the prison, seemed not inappropriate to the dismal investigations carried on there. The presiding judge was Sir John Bayley, an amiable, upright, and independent man, but who was thought to err on the side of humanity. The court was engaged in the trial of a man charged with burglary, who seemed likely to escape owing to the stupidity and hesistation with which the prosecutor gave his evidence; the witness quailed and floundered under the cross-examination of a noisy counsel; but the case was helped out by the glib swearing of a constable, and the prisoner was convicted. This trial possessed little interest, but the sight of the barristers in their wigs and gowns afforded infinite amusement to Matilda, who now saw the legal attire for the first time. She recognized some of her friends in this disguise, but with the same astonishment as if she had seen them in a masquerade dress. It seemed to her of all things the most preposterous thus to disfigure and disguise the human countenance, and she pronounced it at least as bad as the tattooing of the New Zealanders.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[],"geonouns":[["walls",634,639]],"pos_words":[["delight",25,32],["amiable",295,302],["beautiful",388,397],["sufficiently",454,466],["amiable",771,778],["helped",1141,1147],["astonishment",1475,1487]],"neg_words":[["infection",251,260],["gloomy",467,473],["dim",550,553],["prison",647,653],["inappropriate",666,679],["dismal",687,693],["err",833,836],["stupidity",970,979],["noisy",1109,1114],["glib",1159,1163],["prisoner",1197,1205],["preposterous",1575,1587],["bad",1676,1679]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",545,549]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",720,725],["upright",780,787]],"spa_preps":[["out",131,134],["into",575,579],["through",583,590],["under",1076,1081],["out",1148,1151]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.041958042,"vader_sentiment":-0.55,"roberta_sentiment":0.9931229949},{"para_id":64,"paragraph":"From the Crown Court, we proceeded to the Nisi Prius Court, where Mr. Baron Hullock( since deceased) presided, and where some of the most eminent counsel of the day were wrangling about the death of an old horse.

The wall is indented with riches, above which a screen carved in stone, of delicate workmanship, runs along like a string; and upon it rest two full length portraits, very well painted, the one of Col. Stanley, and the other of Mr. Blackburne, who were the members for the county when the portraits were placed there. The roof corresponds with the Gothic character of the hall, rising upwards in a concave form, and being carved in stone, with several clustered pillars supporting it.

George, therefore, perused her delicate features, soft, clear eye, and brow of alabaster, till it seemed almost necessary for him to speak. His bashfulness struggled for a long time, but at length, when I turned to peep at him, I saw, to my amazement, that he was standing, and the lady sitting in his place. He had plucked up courage to offer her his seat, and with a face of crimson was addressing to her some laconic observation.

Lancaster was the Roman fortified station on the Lune, whose ancient name was Lon or Loyne; the town was therefore called Longovicum, and also Lon Caster-- camp on the Lon( whence Lancaster); as Rib Caster,( now Ribchester) was the fortified station of the Romans on the Ribble. Lonsdale, the name of the Hundred of Lancashire we were traversing, derived its name from the fine valley by which it is intersected from the borders of Westmoreland and Yorkshire to the sea.

The woollens made here were coarse, and, what is remarkable, they went by the name of Kendal Cottons at a much earlier period than the real cotton manufacture was known in England. Of late years the manufacture of coarse woollens has greatly declined, owing to the successful competition of the Yorkshire manufacturers; and a finer kind of goods is now made here, consisting principally of fancy waistcoatings. Leather is also extensively manufactured; and there is an establishment for the cutting of marble, of which several different kinds are found in Kendal fell. As the country people for many miles round attend the market, this town combines the character of a manufacturing place with that of the centre of an agricultural district.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Kendal",0,6],["Kendal",296,302],["Kendal",495,501],["England",581,588],["Yorkshire",704,713],["Kendal",965,971]],"geonouns":[["seat",14,18],["country",217,224],["towns",322,327],["fell",972,976],["country",985,992],["market",1032,1038],["town",1045,1049],["district",1141,1149]],"pos_words":[["indebted",75,83],["steady",90,96],["prosperity",97,107],["remarkable",458,468],["successful",674,684],["finer",735,740],["fancy",799,804]],"neg_words":[["coarse",437,443],["coarse",623,629]],"events":[],"dates":[["the fourteenth century",141,163],["a much earlier period",513,534],["late years",593,603]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",427,431],["here",767,771],["there",866,871]],"spa_preps":[["round",1015,1020]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0520833333,"vader_sentiment":0.78,"roberta_sentiment":0.9977443218},{"para_id":108,"paragraph":"Kendal contains nearly 12,000 inhabitants, and is the most populous and wealthy town in Westmoreland.

Various circumstances contributed to produce this feeling. Having come upon the lake at its centre, and having understood that this was the largest of the English lakes, my companions had expected to see a magnificent expanse of water. But unluckily this is the narrowest part, and in the very midst of it runs an island three quarters of a mile long, which, being covered with wood, partially conceals the water beyond it, and looks like the further shore. Add to this, the effect of the woody promontories which run into the lake on either side, and of the dark and lofty hill that rises precipitously from the opposite bank, both of which tend still further to diminish the apparent breadth of the water; and it is not surprising that my cousins should have thought that Windermere looked only like a considerable river. Another circumstance still contributed to their disappointment. It was afternoon, and the sun was declining towards the opposite hill, whose shaded side was presented to us; and this, combined with a considerable degree of sun-haziness, gave an indistinctness to the objects which lay below us in the valley.

I apprehend you would find the same evil passions and fraudulent purposes in these retired valleys as in populous cities, though differently manifested. As to health, formerly rheumatism and ague were very prevalent in these parts; I believe they are less so now. Perhaps the husbandman's limbs grow stark, and his frame wears out, from the effects of toil and exposure to the weather, as soon as the citizen sinks under his confinement and commercial care. I have heard a medical man in these parts say, that from the extensive intermarriages in the small population of the villages and valleys, you may know the diseases of the whole valley if you know those of a single family.

A stupendous crag rises out of the river, so placed as if it had been flung in by some Titanian hand for the express purpose of blocking up its course.

Clouds of spray shoot up from the abyss, and the waters, after boiling in the whirlpool, dart forth down the glen, as if in mortal terror. The water here is not scanty, as in most of the other falls at the Lakes, but is a river scarcely inferior to the Brathay at Skelwith Force. The four falls are several yards apart, but the lowest is of greater depth than all the other three, and the whole are in view at once.

All the features of this view are simple, but of the most striking sublimity. The Pikes tower aloft like pillars of the skies. The highest of them, called Harrison Stickle, has an elevation of 2400 feet above the sea; and the other, called Pike o' Stickle, of 2,000 feet. The latter is pointed by a shaft of naked rock, apparently slender, but in reality enormous, and which appears to be perpendicular towards the valley. Gimmer Crag, between the two Pikes, presents to the valley of lofty and prodigous mass of rock. Bowfell lifts his rugged peak to the height of 2,911 feet, and a long range of crags, called Crinkle crags, extends to the neighbouring heights. The sides of the mountains are furrowed with deep and awful ravines. Our whole party were lost in admiration of the stupendous scene; and I question if they afterwards saw any thing which impressed them so strongly, except, perhaps, the view from the top of Skiddaw.

The quantity of water here is not considerable, but the fall is high and exceedingly picturesque.

Two enormous rocks have fallen into the top of the chasm, and hang suspended in a way alarming to spectator.

The mountains here form an amphitheatre several miles in circumference, yet they are so lofty that the valley which they enclose appears of small dimensions. Loughrigg forms the southern barrier, and the rugged hills of Silver How the western: on the north are the Carrs, Helm Crag and Steel Fell; and on the west the long and lofty ridge of Fairfield from Nab Scar to Seat Sandal. Being shut in on every side by these hills, Grasmere appears to be perfectly secluded from the world; and as the meadows and pastures are luxuriantly fertile, and their green surface is agreeably sprinkled with wood, there is a tranquil beauty in the vale, calculated to excite in the mind the most peaceful and delightful emotions. The lake has one considerable island in the centre, which rises into an eminence, and, being covered with grass, forms an agreeable bank of verdure. It has only a small clump of trees at one end, and a mistal to shelter the cattle and sheep which feed there: a sprinkling of wood on the island would make it a much more interesting object. The small, scattered village of Grasmere at the head of the lake, with its whitened and rural church, has a lively and pleasing appearance. The plain terminates in two upland valleys, one of which, named Easdale, runs up into the heart of Langdale fells, and the other, lying between the range of Fairfield and Steel Fell, rises with a long ascent into a slack, that separates the valleys of Grasmere and Wythburn. Several pretty houses, surrounded by trees, quite in character with this rural scene, lie at the foot of the hills; one of which was formerly inhabited by Wordsworth, and another belonged to De Quincy. Gray came upon this valley from the side of Keswick, and calls it\" a little unsuspected paradise.\" Perhaps the finest view of it is that which we obtained yesterday, in passing over High Close, and down the northern side of Loughrigg. Butterlip How, a grassy knoll in the midst of the valley, affords a charming panorama. In the rear of the village, and in the gorge of Easdale, is a waterfall of considerable elevation, which, after rains, pours down a broad and ample stream. It is formed by the rivulet that flows out of Easdale Tarn, and from its constant whiteness it has received the name of Sour Milk Gill.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Rydal Water",16,27],["Grasmere Water",90,104],["Loughrigg",310,319],["Silver How",372,382],["Helm Crag",424,433],["Steel Fell",438,448],["Fairfield",494,503],["Nab Scar",509,517],["Seat Sandal",521,532],["Grasmere",578,586],["Grasmere",1239,1247],["Easdale",1411,1418],["Langdale",1446,1454],["Fairfield",1504,1513],["Steel Fell",1518,1528],["Grasmere",1599,1607],["Wythburn",1612,1620],["Wordsworth",1777,1787],["Keswick",1868,1875],["High Close",2006,2016],["Loughrigg",2048,2057],["Butterlip How",2059,2072],["Easdale",2194,2201],["Easdale Tarn",2348,2360],["Sour Milk Gill",2422,2436]],"geonouns":[["valley",33,39],["bed",82,85],["lake",123,127],["mountains",156,165],["valley",255,261],["hills",363,368],["ridge",485,490],["hills",571,576],["meadows",647,654],["wood",745,749],["vale",785,789],["lake",871,875],["island",897,903],["bank",999,1003],["trees",1045,1050],["wood",1142,1146],["island",1154,1160],["village",1228,1235],["head",1255,1259],["lake",1267,1271],["church",1301,1307],["valleys",1382,1389],["valleys",1588,1595],["houses",1637,1643],["trees",1659,1664],["foot",1719,1723],["hills",1731,1736],["valley",1844,1850],["valley",2109,2115],["village",2165,2172],["waterfall",2208,2217],["stream",2294,2300]],"pos_words":[["sweet",117,122],["perfectly",601,610],["fertile",684,691],["agreeably",720,729],["tranquil",762,770],["beauty",771,777],["excite",805,811],["peaceful",833,841],["delightful",846,856],["eminence",939,947],["agreeable",989,998],["interesting",1187,1198],["lively",1315,1321],["pleasing",1326,1334],["pretty",1630,1636],["paradise",1912,1920],["finest",1935,1941],["charming",2127,2135],["ample",2288,2293]],"neg_words":[["object",1199,1205],["lying",1477,1482],["slack",1562,1567],["lie",1708,1711]],"events":[],"dates":[["yesterday",1979,1988]],"times":[],"distances":[["about a mile",128,140],["several miles",192,205]],"loc_advs":[["here",166,170],["there",751,756],["there",1119,1124]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",9,15],["out",46,49],["into",50,54],["into",931,935],["into",1428,1432],["between",1483,1490],["into",1555,1559],["over",2001,2005],["down",2022,2026],["down",2271,2275],["out",2341,2344]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0675675676,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9976629019},{"para_id":209,"paragraph":"The most remarkable feature of the vale of Grasmere is Helm Crag, a lofty conical hill which stands at its head, and whose summit is a huge mass of shattered rocks.

He was a man of great talents and virtues; had served many years with distinction in India, where he lost an amiable wife; and had sent his daughter to England, to be educated in the family of his brother-in-law. Affliction had exercised a softening and exalting influence on his mind. After a long absence, he had returned over land to England about two years ago, and he was now revisiting a scene with which he had been familiar in his youth. It would be superfluous to say that George was delighted beyond measure with this happy rencontre: and after the bashfulness he always manifested on a new introduction had subsided, he took an active part in the conversation, and endeavoured, with a natural and honest eagerness, to ingratiate himself both with the father and the daughter. So well did he develop his talents and information in this interview, that I believe he succeeded in his object; and, on the other hand, we were all charmed with the Colonel and his interesting daughter.

They had anciently a castle on Castlerigg, and afterwards a house on one of the principal islands of the lake, which has since borne the name of Lord's Island. The family did not usually reside here, but at Dalston, in Northumberland. Whilst in their possession, Crow Park, at the northeast corner of the lake, and all the long slope of the hills on the eastern shore, were covered with noble forests of oak, which gave to the scene a character of grand solemnity. But when Lord Derwentwater forfeited his head on Tower Hill for partaking in the rebellion of 1715, his estates were confiscated, and bestowed upon Greenwich Hospital, the trustees of which charity, with the discretion that often characterises the management of distant property, especially by public bodies, cleared away the forests at one fell swoop, and stripped the hills of their majestic mantle! Great and irreparable as is the injury, it must be admitted that the knolls and lawns now seen on the waving surface of the shore are highly beautiful: several of the small hills and promontories are again covered with trees, which enclose and enrich the tracts of verdure; and the steep sides of the fells are feathered with natural wood, which, if a less rich and ample, is perhaps a fresher and livelier covering than the old forests. The trustees of the hospital also, whilst the estate was in their possession, refused to let the land on long leases, of which complaint has been made, as it prevented individuals from building mansions on the shore, which, in the opinion of the complainants, would be a great ornament to the lake. In my judgment, however, Derwentwater would be spoiled by the erection of villas and mansions on its borders. I like it now for its seclusion, and should be sorry to see it environed by houses. Windermere, the scenery of which is soft and beautiful, may have its charms heightened by introducing the elegance of art.

The island contains about five acres and a half, and this small space is laid out to the utmost advantage in lawns, shrubberies, and parterres.

The front of the house is covered with ivy, and it has not a disagreeable effect from that side on which alone it can be seen.

We then entered a bay formed by Friar Crag on the north and Lord's Island on the south, in which the one mighty object is Wallow Crag, whose awful precipice towers over the wood spread around its base, to the height of a thousand feet above the lake. We landed on Lord's Island, and saw the traces of the house built here by the Derwentwater family: nothing remains except the mere foundations, all the building-stone having been removed to erect the town-hall of Keswick and other houses. The whole island, of which the extent is sic acres, is now covered with wood. Again entering the boat, we passed up the channel between Lord's Island the shore, from whence beautiful prospects are obtained-- on the one hand, of the majestic form of Skiddaw, with the woods of Castlehead and Cockshot Park in the foreground; and on the other, of the upper part of the lake, the beautiful islands of St. Herbert's and Rampsholm, and the rugged crags and mountains of Borrowdale. Col. H-- n was the first to point out to the ladies a deep cleft in the face of Wallow Crag, wrought by the descent of a torrent in wet weather, and choked with wood, which bears the name of the Lady's Rake, from the circumstance that the Countess of Derwentwater is said to have made her escape by night up the ravine, when intelligence of her husband's arrest reached her. Col. H-- n took occasion to state, by way of bringing to the recollection of the ladies a passage of history which they might but faintly remember, the events of the period connected with the unfortunate family of the Ratcliffes. He sketched the circumstances with simplicity, and not without feeling. The rebellions of 1715 and 1745,-- the active part taken by the Earl of Derwentwater in the first, and by his son in the second, on behalf of the Pretender,-- the ruin of their noble house, by clinging to the fortunes of an ill-starred, despotic, and stubbornly unteachable race of princes,-- and the disasters of some other branches of the family,-- were briefly narrated, with a pathos perhaps insensibly heightened from the scene of the Countess's perilous flight being before our eyes. The romantic character of the incident itself, and of the mountain-pass through which the lady fled, brought vividly to our minds some of the descriptions in Waverley, where highland glens and\" hair-breadth' scapes,\" unsuccessful rebellion and the ruin of ancient families, are so graphically depicted.

The extent of this island is sometimes half an acre; it has risen only seven times since the year 1808, and generally appears in hot summers; it appeared in the successive summers of 1824, 1825, and 1826. The most probable conjecture as to the cause of the phenomenon is, that the vegetable subtances upon it, in the process of decomposition, form a large quantity of gas, which pervades the spongy substance of the island, and makes it so light as to rise to the surface. Heat promotes the accumulation of gas, and when the gas is carried off by exposure to the atmosphere or is condensed by cold, the island sinks. When the surface is pierced, gas issues forth, which has been collected, and found to consist of equal parts of carburetted hydrogen and azotic gases, with about six per cent. of carbonic acid. It has been supposed that the water of a small cascade, named Cat Gill, which tumbles down the rocks near this place, and which then finds a subterraneous passage into the lake, may have been the cause of buoying up the Island: but this supposition is generally disallowed by men of science.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Floating Island",66,81],["Cat Gill",1116,1124]],"geonouns":[["lake",32,36],["lake",133,137],["island",262,268],["island",659,665],["island",846,852],["water",1084,1089],["rocks",1149,1154],["lake",1226,1230]],"pos_words":[["hot",372,375]],"neg_words":[["sinking",234,241],["cold",836,840],["issues",893,899],["tumbles",1132,1139]],"events":[],"dates":[["the year 1808",332,345],["1824",426,430],["1825",432,436],["1826",442,446]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",37,42]],"spa_preps":[["above",108,113],["about",1016,1021],["down",1140,1144],["near",1155,1159],["into",1217,1221]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0260869565,"vader_sentiment":0.7,"roberta_sentiment":0.9928588867},{"para_id":247,"paragraph":"The River Derwent, up which we rowed a short distance, is perhaps the most limpid and colourless stream in this country; we saw the small gray pebbles which form its bed at the depth of six or eight feet, and should scarcely have known that any medium denser than air was betwixt them and the eye, but for a certain glassy smoothness which the liquid necessarily gives them.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["River Derwent",4,17]],"geonouns":[["stream",97,103],["country",112,119],["bed",166,169]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[["scarcely",216,224]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["six or eight feet",186,203]],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0303030303,"vader_sentiment":0.39,"roberta_sentiment":0.9976691604},{"para_id":248,"paragraph":"Landing on the eastern bank of the Derwent, we walked a few hundred yards to the celebrated Fall of Lowdore, situated in a chasm to the rear of a hamlet of that name.

Its height is about a hundred and fifty feet, and the water tumbles over and amongst a jumbled pile of rocks, dashing, brawling, and foaming, and in no place( at this period) falling more than a few yards at once. The stream comes down a ravine of the hill, out of the valley of Watendlath, and, when sudden rains augment its quantity and force, it flings itself furiously over the precipice, and hides all the rocks which obstruct its descent, roaring with tremendous dissonance, and scattering the foam of its wrath far and wide. It is said that the noise of the cataract can at these periods be heard to a distance of ten or twelve miles; which, however, seems scarcely credible. The effect of the scene is greatly increased by the prodigious crags which rise on either side of the fall, one of them, called Gowder Crag, to the perpendicular height of five hundred feet. The opposite mass of rock is called Shepherd's Crag.

The place where we stood being several hundred yards from the hill-side, it required a rather loud shout to obtain a response; but the number of syllables which might be uttered before the answer came, was of course proportioned to the distance. The Colonel, George, and myself hollaed loud and long; we invoked Skiddaw, Helvellyn, Niagara, Himalaya, Glaramara, and other magnificent and sounding names, all which the faithful reflector flung back upon our ears, as distinctly as if the words had been palpable and elastic objects, and had struck the rocks with the sharpness of a hammer. I believe a person of good lungs and nimble tongue, like Mathews, might obtain a perfect replication of the name of the race-horse, Caifakaratadadera-- a name given, I suppose, in the hope that the horse would run the faster from having so many feet. We endeavoured to prevail upon the ladies to try their voices, but they pleaded inability to produce an echo at such a distance. At length Matilda called out Dunmail Raise with a small shrill shout, which the cliffs returned in such a tone of scoffing mockery, that if our antiquarian friend had been present, I am persuaded he would have flown into a rage. The singularity of the sound, and the scene it recalled to our minds, produced a long and general fit of laughter; at which the fells unexpectedly awoke their obsequious mirth, and shook their sides with laughter. Our experiments were terminated by the discharge of a cannon, which is placed there for the purpose, and fired by the people of Lowdore Inn for the amusement of those who will pay for it. Mrs. Anabella and Matilda were so much alarmed by the preparations, that they ran to a distance of fifty or sixty yards, whilst Miss H-- n stood calmly near the piece, like a soldier's daughter. The reverberation was truly awful: from Borrowdale fells it was hurled back to the opposite heights of Catbells and Causey Pike, whence it roared round the whole amphitheatre of mountains in a prolonged peal. Such is generally the solemn stillness of this scene, that we felt a kind of superstitious awe at having thus violently disturbed it, by calling upon the spirits of the mountains to answer us;-- as some enchanters in Eastern tales are alarmed when their invocations are obeyed by the appearance of awful genii.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["George",457,463],["Skiddaw",510,517],["Helvellyn",519,528],["Niagara",530,537],["Glaramara",549,558],["Dunmail Raise",1196,1209],["Lowdore",1738,1745],["Borrowdale",2033,2043],["Catbells",2096,2104],["Causey Pike",2109,2120]],"geonouns":[["meadow",7,13],["boat",45,49],["wall",192,196],["hill",260,264],["rocks",749,754],["feet",1032,1036],["mountains",2171,2180],["mountains",2371,2380]],"pos_words":[["fine",64,68],["magnificent",570,581],["faithful",616,624],["good",809,813],["nimble",824,830],["like",839,843],["perfect",868,875],["faster",1005,1011],["like",1966,1970],["awe",2293,2296]],"neg_words":[["loud",292,296],["loud",484,488],["struck",738,744],["inability",1118,1127],["shrill",1223,1229],["mockery",1290,1297],["rage",1390,1394],["unexpectedly",1530,1542],["alarmed",1837,1844],["awful",2021,2026],["solemn",2224,2230],["superstitious",2279,2292],["violently",2312,2321],["disturbed",2322,2331],["alarmed",2437,2444],["awful",2500,2505]],"events":[["Echo",69,73]],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["here",136,140],["there",1688,1693]],"spa_preps":[["out",1192,1195],["into",1383,1387],["near",1950,1954],["opposite",2076,2084],["round",2139,2144]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0266666667,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9972313046},{"para_id":250,"paragraph":"The effect was increased by the approach of evening; for we had lingered so long at Lowdore, with the cataract and the echo, that the sun had gone down nearly an hour, and the twilight was rapidly deepening into dusk.

He complied by pulling vigorously across the southern extremity of the lake, and along the western shore. We were now immediately opposite the jaws of Borrowdale, and could just see the tall, shaggy forms of Grange Crag and Castle Crag, which guard the entrance. The extreme wildness and ruggedness of the cliffs on either side, and the darkness which brooded over the valley beyond, caused a shudder to come across the ladies as they contemplated it. The obscurity of the scene only gave play to their imaginations, which probably conjured up ideas of Borrowdale as not less horrible than the valley of the shadow of death. The mountains on the western side of the lake, which seemed almost to overhang us, were a mighty shade: and the rugged outlines of Catbells and Causey Pike were traced in the strongest relief against the sky, still illumined by the white light which lingers on the horizon in an autumn evening.

At Wasdale Head our companion had picked up two excellent horses, which he had borrowed from a farmer at Calder Bridge, to convey his fair cousins in the morning; and when we had determined to proceed to that place, he urged the expediency of one of us mounting the horse which he had lef, so that we might get over the ground at a better speed.

We, therefore, without hesitation accepted his offer, and, George having mounted on a lady's saddle, we set off at a round pace towards Calder Bridge.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Strands",68,75],["Nether Wasdale",80,94],["Wasdale Head",245,257],["Kirkfell",310,318],["Yewbarrow",323,332],["Ennerdale",379,388],["Scarf Gap",411,420],["Haystacks",434,443],["High Crag",448,457],["Buttermere",476,486],["Calder Bridge",574,587],["Strands",608,615],["Crummock Water",764,778],["Buttermere",783,793],["Ennerdale",836,845],["Lowes Water",856,867],["Wasdale",982,989],["Buttermere",994,1004],["Wasdale Head",1231,1243],["Calder Bridge",1333,1346],["George",1929,1935],["Calder Bridge",2006,2019]],"geonouns":[["village",98,105],["foot",124,128],["lake",136,140],["inns",185,189],["track",296,301],["valley",369,375],["pass",403,407],["vale",468,472],["inn",647,650],["abbey",703,708],["lakes",827,832],["mountain",958,966],["passes",967,973],["carriage",1029,1037],["road",1038,1042],["ground",1548,1554],["road",1604,1608]],"pos_words":[["neat",172,176],["recommended",540,551],["better",640,646],["great",891,896],["recommendation",897,911],["good",1024,1028],["excellent",1276,1285],["fair",1362,1366],["better",1560,1566],["gained",1638,1644],["like",1709,1713]],"neg_words":[["ruins",691,696],["doubtful",1135,1143],["waning",1681,1687],["ragged",1800,1806]],"events":[["Black Sale",339,349]],"dates":[["our quarters",38,50],["the following day",224,241],["the following day",797,814]],"times":[["the night",55,64],["the morning",1378,1389],["the afternoon",1657,1670]],"distances":[["a mile",106,112],["seven miles",589,600]],"loc_advs":[["there",148,153],["across",351,357],["between",422,429],["there",623,628],["there",1614,1619],["without",1885,1892]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",113,119],["between",302,309],["over",334,338],["over",394,398],["into",459,463],["beyond",601,607],["between",974,981],["over",1539,1543],["away",1688,1692],["round",1987,1992]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0388888889,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9753574133},{"para_id":301,"paragraph":"We soon found ourselves nearly upon the sea-coast, which is here very open.

The country through which we passed was rather pretty, but of course it appeared tame to us, who had just issued from the region of the sublime and picturesque. We reached Calder Bridge at five o'clock, when we parted from our new acquaintance, whom we could hardly persuade to accept any renumeration for the services he had rendered us. Our day's journey had not exceeded twenty - seven miles, and we felt but slightly fatigued. Having ordered dinner, we walked to Calder Abbey, at the distance of a mile from the inn. It is a small and beautiful ruin, whose Gothic arches, mantled with ivy, and shaded by a row of stately elms, stand in the grounds and close to the mansion of the Senhouses, occupied by Captain Irwin. The ruin forms a boundary to his lawn, and the Captain, whom we found on the spot, told us that he had done a good deal to improve its effect, by taking down some of the modern encumbrances. The Abbey is seven centuries old, and the central part is still entire. Some of the out-buildings have long been used as stables; we entered one of them under a venerable Gothic archway, and found that the cows ruminate now where the monks ruminated in former days. The grounds are pretty, and the woods, together with the woods of Ponsonby Hall, the seat of Edwd. Stanley, Esq., M.P. for the western division of Cumberland, give considerable beauty to the village.

The same conformation may be remarked in numerous instances amongst the hills of Westmoreland and Cumberland. The mountains are principally composed of schist, and the softness of this material, yielding to the gradual influence of the elements, naturally produces an equal slope on both sides of a ridge of hills, which causes the extremity of the ridge to form a regular and beautiful core. There is scarcely any mountain or chain of mountains in this district, which does not present a conical shape on one of its sides.

But there is a much shorter route than either of these from Keswick, namely, up the vale of Newlands, which runs directly through the midst of these wild mountains, from the plain of the Derwent to the valley of Buttermere.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Lowes Water",19,30],["Crummock Water",64,78],["Buttermere",241,251],["Lowes Water",280,291],["Crummock",307,315],["Cockermouth.",364,376],["Crummock Water",391,405],["Buttermere",410,420],["Borrowdale",439,449],["Derwent",471,478],["Grasmoor",549,557],["Grisedale Pike",559,573],["Keswick",628,635],["Crummock Water",639,653],["Grisedale Pike",678,692],["Buttermere",715,725],["Gatesgarth Dale",762,777],["Borrowdale",787,797],["Hawse",798,803],["Borrowdale",825,835],["Keswick",897,904],["Newlands",929,937],["Derwent",1024,1031],["Buttermere",1049,1059]],"geonouns":[["valleys",111,118],["mountains",154,163],["valley",183,189],["lake",233,237],["valley",270,276],["foot",299,303],["lake",316,320],["valley",381,387],["hills",515,520],["road",618,622],["head",707,711],["road",748,752],["vale",921,925],["mountains",991,1000],["valley",1039,1045]],"pos_words":[["great",105,110]],"neg_words":[["lies",86,90],["barren",508,514],["wild",986,990]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["about a mile",31,43]],"loc_advs":[["there",726,731],["there",841,846]],"spa_preps":[["round",660,665],["through",754,761],["over",782,786],["through",959,966]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0212765957,"vader_sentiment":0.17,"roberta_sentiment":0.9975883961},{"para_id":312,"paragraph":"When we came within view of Crummock Water, where, as I have said, two valleys meet, we were charmed by the luxuriant profusion of wood which covers the whole space below the foot of the lake, especially as contrasted with the barren sternness of the two mountain ridges betwixt which Crummock Water lies-- Grasmoor and Melbreak.

Its numerous towers, of different shapes and elevations, are crested with battlements, and pierced with slit windows: and the fresh colour of the stone gives great richness to all these harmonious masses of architecture. A high embattled wall surrounds the entrance-court, and the entrance is through an arched gateway. The terrace is five hundred feet long, and one hundred wide. The southern front forms a remarkable contrast with the northern, being built in the Gothic cathedral style, with pointed and mullioned windows, delicate pinnacles, niches, and cloisters; and the scene from this front accords well with the solemn character of the edifice, being a lawn of emerald green and velvet smoothness, shut in by ornamental trees and shrubs and by timber of stately growth.

There are several mansions and cottages both on the Westmoreland and Cumberland sides, which presented themselves to us advantageously as we rowed up the lake. Some of the houses stand in elevated situations, commanding an extensive prospect over the surrounding country; whilst others are built near the edge of the lake, under the shelter of the rising ground and of encircling groves, betwixt which ornamental lawns slope down to the water's brink. Amongst the houses in the latter situation is Rampsbeck Lodge, the beautiful residence of Mr. Stagg, about the middle of the first reach, on the Cumberland side. Beau Thorn, so called from a plantation of white thorns which surrounds it, and Lemon House, are also delightfully situated. Watermillock, the seat of the late Colonel Robinson, now occupied by the Rev. Mr. Tinkler, has been long celebrated by travellers; it stands on an elevated point on the same side of Ullswater, looking down the lower reach of the lake. The back-ground of the view from these houses is formed by Swarth Fell, a bold ridge which skirts the southern border of the reach, and runs up towards the Martindale fells. Our boatman pointed out a part of the fell, so steep as to seem to us nearly perpendicular, down which the late Mr. Hasell, of Dalemain, descended with his horse, having, in the heat of the chase, passed over the brow of the hill into a situation from which it was impossible to re-ascend. He dismounted from his hunter, and the sagacious and experienced animal, making common cause with him, slid down the long and perilous descent on his haunches, at once supporting and being supported by his master, till they arrived safely at the bottom.

A fine cream-coloured bloodhound, kenneled near the door of the tower, is another characteristic appendage to the residence of a feudal baron.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Greystoke",120,129],["Castle",130,136],["Glencoin",307,315],["Glencoin",587,595],["Park",596,600],["Gowbarrow Park",602,616],["Park",630,634],["Gowbarrow Park",783,797],["Park",806,810],["Yew Crag",905,913],["Gowbarrow Park",915,929],["Lyulph's Tower",1438,1452]],"geonouns":[["parks",155,160],["mountain",201,209],["buildings",365,374],["woods",449,454],["parks",580,585],["head",761,765],["mountain",840,848],["rock",892,896],["woods",1020,1025],["building",1421,1429],["edge",1470,1474],["wood",1480,1484],["mansion",1613,1620],["heads",1743,1748],["door",1828,1832],["tower",1840,1845],["residence",1890,1899]],"pos_words":[["picturesque",270,281],["beautiful",287,296],["interesting",942,953],["elegance",1109,1117],["good",1184,1188],["impresses",1229,1238],["pleasing",1312,1320],["reverence",1346,1355],["lead",1504,1508],["fine",1778,1782]],"neg_words":[["wild",264,268],["neglected",1010,1019],["rough",1061,1066],["melancholy",1321,1331]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[["four miles",229,239]],"loc_advs":[["left",380,384],["there",811,816],["near",1819,1823]],"spa_preps":[["along",173,178],["into",569,573],["over",1363,1367]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0337078652,"vader_sentiment":0.73,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986666441},{"para_id":361,"paragraph":"Lyulph's Tower has been so called after Lyulph, the first baron of Greystock, who received the grant soon after the Conquest, and who was the proprietor of Ullswater.

The water falls about eighty feet perpendicularly through a chasm of the rocks; at the top it is divided by a narrow ledge into two streams, which unite before they have fallen halfway down, and are dashed against a projecting part of the rock, from which they rebound in expanding sheets of foam. Amidst clouds of spray the waters plunge into a deep basin, and soon issue forth from the gulph in a rapid stream, as transparent as before their fall. The rocks and trees stand all round this cascade, so as to make it perfectly secluded; the oak and the ash bend their branches over the fall, and involve it in a cool shade. We ascended by a circuitous path to the top; and when we saw the fall from above, it struck us even more than the view from below. As the sun's rays fell upon the clouds of spray, an iris flung it lovely arch over the chasm-- its splendour alternately brightening and fading with the great or less density of the spray.

Then, at the desire of the boatmen, we crossed again to the side of Gowbarrow Park, just where it terminates in the deep and secluded valley of Glencoin, which contributes its streamlet to the waters of the lake. He contrived that we should creep along the shore till we came close under a lofty crag, enveloped from the base to the summit in natural wood. Then, turning the head of the boat from the land, and desiring me to pull as strongly as I could, whilst he directed us all to keep our eyes on the crag, we shot out towards the middle of the lake. The effect was magical. The naked peak of the mountain, before concealed, seemed to rise up swiftly out of the woody eminence from which we were receding, till it stood in its just proportions before us, and appeared many hundred feet above our heads, leaving at its base the bold crag from under which we had darted.

At first the peal roared along the hills behind us: anon, it appeared to rend the bowels of Place Fell, which rose immediately in front: then, when it had subsided, the thunder returned upon us from the higher part of the Helvellyn range: again it died away, but again revived along the distance hills of Gowbarrow Park.

The latter, indeed, was rather a fanciful reason, as the guides are usually very accommodating and unobtrusive. I had taken the precaution to make diligent inquiry of the boatman who came with us to Pooley Bridge, and who knew the mountain well, as to the path we should follow in order to reach the top. He pointed out a faintly-traced pathway about half the distance, as far as the summit of a ridge which runs up on the north side of Grisedale Beck, and conducts to the head of the mountain. He then told us, that when we had got upon that ridge we should see the top of Helvellyn, and, immediately beneath it, a tarn; that there were two ways of proceeding thence to the summit,-- the shortest, by keeping along the top of the ridge, which was called Striding Edge,-- and the other, which was longer but much safer, by descending a little on the opposite side of the ridge, and re-ascending by Swirrel Edge, which would leave the tarn on our left hand. He said that the passage of Striding Edge, though frequently accomplished, was attended with some danger, as it was like walking along the narrow ridge of a steep roof; and he intimated that we should probably find that part of the mountain very different from what we expected. Having made up our minds to overcome our own sagacity and exertions the difficulties we might encounter, and supposing that the boatman somewhat exaggerated the perils of the ascent for the purpose of being engaged to accompany us, we made light of his warnings, but carefully treasured up his instructions in our memories.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Stybarrow Crag",86,100],["Place Fell",120,130],["Pooley Bridge",774,787],["Grisedale",1012,1021],["Helvellyn",1149,1158],["Swirrel Edge",1473,1485],["Striding Edge",1560,1573]],"geonouns":[["hill",75,79],["mountain",806,814],["path",831,835],["summit",959,965],["ridge",971,976],["head",1048,1052],["mountain",1060,1068],["ridge",1118,1123],["tarn",1191,1195],["ridge",1306,1311],["ridge",1446,1451],["tarn",1509,1513],["ridge",1678,1683],["mountain",1764,1772]],"pos_words":[["clear",108,113],["confident",205,214],["fine",240,244],["superior",448,456],["diligent",722,730],["well",815,819],["top",875,878],["top",1142,1145],["top",1295,1298],["accomplished",1593,1605],["like",1648,1652],["sagacity",1856,1864]],"neg_words":[["disliking",478,487],["fanciful",608,616],["danger",1630,1636],["steep",1689,1694],["difficulties",1883,1895]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",220,227]],"times":[["night",142,147],["morning",175,182],["half - past nine o'clock",311,335]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["above",80,85],["beneath",1177,1184],["there",1202,1207],["left",1521,1525]],"spa_preps":[["out",340,343],["out",891,894],["about",920,925],["along",1285,1290],["opposite",1425,1433],["along",1661,1666]],"normalised_sentiment":0.037037037,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9986195564},{"para_id":380,"paragraph":"For about half a mile we pursued the high road to Pooley Bridge, till we had crossed the bridge over Grisedale Beck, near Patterdale Hall, when we turned immediately to the left, and began to ascend the mountain at a very deliberate pace.

Two ridges, Striding Edge and Swirrel Edge, run down from the top of the mountain, enclosing betwixt them a considerable valley, in which lies the tarn just mentioned.

As we ascended, the hill became more steep and rugged, till at length the ridge presented nothing but rocks, the narrow edges of which lay upwards in the direction of the sky. Their sides became steeper and steeper, and it was with difficulty that we crept along paths not wider than a goat-track, to avoid clambering among the crags which formed the very ridge of the hill. At length it became impossible to find footing on the side, and we betook ourselves of necessity to the ridge itself. We now came in view of the most formidable part of Striding Edge, and found that it rather deserved to be compared to a narrow wall, several hundred feet in height, connecting the hill which we had been ascending with the head of the mountain, than to the steep roof of a house. It appeared to us to be absolutely precipitous on each side, and the top of the rocky wall was not more than from one to two yards wide, whilst in some places we could not see, before we came up to it, as much ground as would serve to plant a foot upon-- the rocks presenting their sharp and ragged edges upwards, like slates or tiles standing on end. If we had had a guide, all this would have been much less terrific, because he would have led the way, and shown us where to place every footstep. The possibility that we might, after all, have taken a wrong direction, or that in some part of the pass we should find ourselves in a situation where we could neither advance nor retreat, gave us considerable alarm. Neither of us, however, expressed our fears at the time, and I felt myself bound to keep up both my own spirits and George's, as the blame would have been chiefly mine if any accident had happened. I therefore talked loudly and confidently as we scrambled along, keeping all my eyes about me, and giving him such instructions as his want of experience in climbing rendered necessary. He said little or nothing, and never ventured to cast a look either to the tarn which lay several hundred feet below us on one side, or to the equally awful depth on the other; but, fixing his eyes on the ridge itself as if he were fascinated, he crept on after me as cautiously and yet as fast as he could. In this way we crossed the long and dangerous pass of Striding Edge, till we came to the last ascent of the mountain. This part is exceedingly steep, but still there is ample room for the foot, and, without waiting a moment, we began to ascend as quickly as possible.

It resembles a house seen at the gable-end, and may be equally like a spireless church.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Brotherswater",19,32],["Kirkstone",208,217],["Kirkstone",918,927]],"geonouns":[["valley",38,44],["dell",123,127],["road",155,159],["road",269,273],["carriage",298,306],["hill",381,385],["track",415,420],["mountains",501,510],["hills",580,585],["pass",636,640],["top",778,781],["stone",805,810],["brow",826,830],["hill",838,842],["road",864,868],["house",944,949],["church",1009,1015]],"pos_words":[["grandeur",619,627],["enjoy",692,697],["diversified",714,725],["charming",730,738],["right",851,856],["like",992,996]],"neg_words":[["loses",60,65],["steep",93,98],["barren",116,122],["torrent",166,173],["arduous",252,259],["worse",279,284]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",601,606]],"spa_preps":[["over",322,326]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.89,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9976540208},{"para_id":397,"paragraph":"On the name of Kirkstone, as on every subject of antiquarian lore, there are diverse opinions; some think that it has arisen from the resemblance of large stone mentioned above to a church or kirk; others say that it is an abbreviation of kirock-stone-- kirock signifying a heap of stones formerly used as boundary-marks or guides for travellers, and that such heaps of stones are found on the hill.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Kirkstone",15,24]],"geonouns":[["stone",155,160],["church",182,188],["stones",282,288],["stones",370,376],["hill",394,398]],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",67,72],["above",171,176]],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9852740169},{"para_id":398,"paragraph":"From the higher part of the pass, which is a small moor at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above Ambleside, lying betwixt two higher mountains, Colddale Fell on the left, and Scandale Fell on the right, we suddenly obtained a view of the head of Windermere far beneath us, and of the beautiful country beyond it, with the bold mountains of the Coniston and Langdale districts in the back-ground.

Setting out at the same hour as the\" over-Sands\" coach to Ulverston, I arrived at Hest Bank, on the shores of Morecambe Bay, three miles and a half from Lancaster, about five in the afternoon. Here a little caravan was collected, waiting the proper time to cross the trackless sands left bare by the receding tide. I soon saw two persons set out in a gig, and, following them, found that one of them was the Guide appointed to conduct travellers, and the other a servant, who was driving his master's gig to the Cartmel shore, and was to return with the horse the same evening. He had of course no time to lose, and had begun his journey at the earliest possible hour. We found that the Sands firm and level, except the slight wrinkles produced by the ribble of the waves, but they were still wet, having only just been left by the sea. The Guide appeared to drive with caution, and in no place went further than a mile from land. We had a good deal of conversation, and I found him intelligent and communicative. His name is Thomas Wilkinson. He is a tall, athletic man, past the middle age, and bears marks of the rough weather he has been exposed to in discharging the duties of his post during the winter months. In stormy, and more especially in foggy weather, those duties must be arduous and anxious. It is his business to station himself at the place where the River Keer runs over the Sands to the sea, which is about three miles from Hest Bank, and to show travellers where they may pass with safety. The bed of the river is liable to frequent changes, and a fresh of water after rain may in a very short time convert a fordable place into a quicksand. When we came to the river, he got out of the gig, and waded over to ascertain the firmness of the bottom, the water being about knee-deep. Having escorted us a little further, till we saw the Guide for the Kent at a distance, and having pointed out the line we should keep, he left us to return to his proper post. We gave him, as is usual, a few pence; for though he is appointed by government, his salary is only \u00a3 10 a year, and he is of course chiefly dependant on what he receives from travellers.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Lancaster",84,93],["Ulverston",230,239],["Morecambe Bay",282,295],["Lancaster",325,334],["Cartmel",684,691],["River",1541,1546],["Kent",2041,2045]],"geonouns":[["coach",221,226],["shores",272,278],["sands",449,454],["shore",692,697],["sea",1004,1007],["land",1097,1101],["post",1358,1362],["station",1502,1509],["sea",1579,1582],["pass",1665,1669],["bed",1687,1690],["river",1698,1703],["water",1750,1755],["river",1855,1860],["water",1945,1950],["line",2088,2092],["post",2144,2148]],"pos_words":[["easy",12,16],["agreeable",21,30],["proper",414,420],["master",664,670],["good",1112,1116],["intelligent",1155,1166],["fresh",1741,1746],["proper",2137,2143]],"neg_words":[["lose",778,782],["wrinkles",899,907],["rough",1288,1293],["stormy",1392,1398],["arduous",1459,1466],["anxious",1471,1478],["liable",1707,1713]],"events":[],"dates":[["the\"",204,208],["the winter months",1370,1387],["a year",2255,2261]],"times":[["the same hour",187,200],["five in",342,349],["the afternoon",350,363],["evening",741,748],["hour",835,839]],"distances":[["three miles and a half",297,319],["a mile",1085,1091],["about three miles",1593,1610]],"loc_advs":[["left",455,459],["left",992,996],["past",1244,1248],["left",2112,2116]],"spa_preps":[["out",180,183],["over",209,213],["about",336,341],["out",514,517],["over",1557,1561],["into",1817,1821],["out",1869,1872],["over",1895,1899],["about",1957,1962],["out",2080,2083]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0048780488,"vader_sentiment":0.89,"roberta_sentiment":0.9975797534},{"para_id":410,"paragraph":"These sands are called the Lancaster Sands, and the guide said that they were at present eleven miles over, from Hest Bank to Kent's - bank, but that he had known them when he could pass directly over in not more than seven miles.

The first of these places is at the distance of a mile from Ulverston. In approaching it I crossed a narrow dell, shaded by a grove of fine beech-trees, and watered by a murmuring brook. The old hall is overshadowed by two sycamores of large growth; but its dilapidated condition, the barns and stables by which it is surrounded, and the litter of a farm-yard, give it no very classical air. My friend the farmer welcomed my arrival, and, after he had put up my horse, showed me over every room in the house, from the venerable lumber-room and garret down to the subterranean dairy. His wife was thriftily employed in whitewashing the hall, which is a spacious apartment, with oaken wainscoting, that had once been handsome. I was taken into the study of George Fox, where he reposed and meditated in the intervals of those laborious missions which he undertook to persuade men to make the gospel, in all its simplicity, the standard of their conduct, in opposition to human customs and inventions. The bed-rooms are spacious apartments, and have in former-days been ornamented with carved work,( which George doubtless found there when he succeeded to the wife and mansion of Judge Fell) now so damaged as to be no longer a decoration. In one of them is a substantial old bedstead, with carved posts, on which, as I was assured by the farmer, the proto-quaker used to repose, and which any of his followers is permitted to occupy for a night; but he said not a single Friend had availed himself of the privilege during the four years that he had resided there,-- a circumstance the less to be wondered at, as the bed is now customarily tenanted by the servants. On one side of the house is an orchard, which appears at least as old as the building. The hall stands high, and its upper windows, overlooking the trees of the orchard, command an extensive and beautiful prospect. Fox did not reside here more than four years, though he married the widow of Judge Fell in 1669, and lived till 1690. The lady and her daughters were amongst his early converts, during the life-time of the Judge, who himself protected the persecuted quakers. From the hall we went to the meeting-house, which is about a quarter of a mile distant. It is a neat, plain building, in perfect repair, and is still used by the Friends of Ulverston and the neighbourhood for their religious meetings. Over the door is carved in stone--\" Ex dono G.

This was the capital of Furness when the neighbouring Abbey was in its splendour, but now appears as if not a house had been added to it for centuries. It is surrounded by undulating grassy hills, and has a single plantation just in its rear. A mile beyond the town, I turned from the high road into a lane shaded with oaks, running down a narrow valley or glen, called the\" glen of deadly nightshade;\" and at the bottom of this glen, under the solemn shade of majestic forest-trees, I came upon the ruins of the famous Abbey of Furness. The first effect would be much more imposing, if you did not approach through a farm-yard, and by a small manor-house; but beyond them you obtain a full view of the venerable ruin itself, with a grassy area in front, and enclosed on each side by noble groves of the plane, the ash, and the oak. The Abbey, though much shattered and having lost the central tower, is still extensive and magnificent. Lofty walls and arches, clustered columns, and long-drawn aisles, remain; and the fine symmetry and noble proportions of the arches contrast most picturesquely with the rents and fractures of the pile. The former extent of the building may in some degree be judged of when I state that what remains measures five hundred feet from north to south, and three hundred from east to west. A man whom I found digging for stone in the hill-side, became my cicerone, and took me round first to the southern extremity of the Abbey. Here I saw that the glen made a very sudden bend just below the ruin, which gave it the appearance of a cul de sac, terminating in a concave sweep of the hill, which might have served for the seats of an ancient theatre. I fancied that the situation reconciled opposite advantages, and therein resembled the monastic institution itself. The Abbey lies in a nook apparently so secluded that it might be deemed the utmost corner of the earth; yet you have only to ascend the hills on either side, which is the work of a few minutes, and you look abroad on the wide world, embracing all the extent of sea and land prospect which I have described as visible from the shores of the bay of Morecambe. So the monks came hither professedly to withdraw themselves from worldly vanities, and in solitude, mortification, and austere simplicity to devote themselves to penitence and prayer; yet they threw up for these purposes a structure whose splendour and vastness mocked the abodes or princes, and where there was every provision for the pleasures of sense. Thus, under the semblance of extreme humility, may pride construct for itself the haughtiest dwelling-place in the recesses of the human heart; thus, when men would withdraw farthest from the world, do they often deceitfully leave themselves the opportunity of peeping abroad on the fields of created good.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Dalton",55,61],["Furness",219,226],["Abbey",249,254],["Abbey",715,720],["Furness",724,731],["The Abbey",1028,1037],["Abbey",1648,1653],["The Abbey",1992,2001],["Morecambe",2339,2348]],"geonouns":[["town",92,96],["church",105,111],["tower",154,159],["castle",187,193],["house",305,310],["hills",385,390],["town",456,460],["road",485,489],["lane",497,501],["valley",542,548],["glen",552,556],["glen",570,574],["glen",624,628],["forest",665,671],["trees",672,677],["farm",813,817],["house",845,850],["groves",985,991],["tower",1089,1094],["walls",1138,1143],["building",1359,1367],["stone",1547,1552],["hill",1560,1564],["glen",1675,1679],["hill",1809,1813],["seats",1847,1852],["nook",2012,2016],["hills",2128,2133],["sea",2253,2256],["land",2261,2265],["shores",2318,2324],["bay",2332,2335],["fields",2989,2995]],"pos_words":[["neat",72,76],["majestic",656,664],["famous",708,714],["noble",979,984],["magnificent",1119,1130],["fine",1214,1218],["noble",1232,1237],["advantages",1925,1935],["work",2163,2167],["humility",2743,2751],["pride",2757,2762],["good",3007,3011]],"neg_words":[["deadly",578,584],["solemn",640,646],["ruins",695,700],["imposing",769,777],["ruin",908,912],["lost",1072,1076],["ruin",1719,1723],["lies",2002,2006],["mortification",2450,2463],["austere",2469,2476],["mocked",2612,2618],["deceitfully",2919,2930]],"events":[],"dates":[["centuries",336,345],["the\"",565,569]],"times":[["The first",733,742],["a few minutes",2171,2184]],"distances":[["A mile",438,444],["five hundred feet",1440,1457]],"loc_advs":[["beyond",856,862],["opposite",1916,1924],["abroad",2199,2205],["hither",2368,2374],["there",2652,2657],["abroad",2975,2981]],"spa_preps":[["beyond",445,451],["into",490,494],["down",528,532],["under",630,635],["through",803,810],["round",1603,1608],["below",1709,1714],["under",2712,2717]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.95,"roberta_sentiment":0.9948139191},{"para_id":421,"paragraph":"\" This Abbey,\" says Mr. West,\" was founded by Stephen Earl of Montaign and Bologne, afterwards King of Englan, A.D. 1127, and was endowed with the lordship of Furness and many royal privileges.

The monks were of the order of Savigny, and their dress was grey cloth, but on receiving St. Bernard's form, they changed from grey to white, and became Cistercians; and such they remained till the dissolution of the monasteries.\" The Abbey flourished during four centuries, and held almost entire and unlimited possession of this rich and extensive district. In magnitude it was the second Abbey in England belonging to the Cistercians, and next to Fountain's Abbey in opulence. When the funds for its maintenance were withdrawn on the dissolution of monasteries, not only the monks were dispersed, but the Abbey itelf soon became ruinous.

The college and the school-house are the most complete apartments remaining: the former has an arched roof still quite perfect: its tall narrow windows have no arch, but terminated upwards in the shape of a pediment. The school-house is equally perfect, but is smaller and less ornamental. From these apartments we proceeded over a space where scarcely a fragment remains, to the kitchens, and thence to the refectorium, which has been a very spacious hall, with a row of columns in the centre supporting the vaulted roof, and the walls counterarched. A few years since this hall was filled with earth and fragments as high as the capitals of the pillars on the walls; of course the pillars were concealed, the arches lost their effect, the walls appeared comparatively low, and nothing was known of the row of columns in the centre. The removal of the rubbish has shown what the design and appearance of the hall have been. The proportions of the walls and arches are restored, and the bases of the central row of columns are all found, with considerable fragments of the columns themselves, which are placed in their proper situations. The chapter-house, the most sumptuous apartment of the building, is equally a gainer by the operations. The fretted roof, which fell in about the middle of the last century, was supported by six deeply-channeled columns in two rows, considerable fragments of which have been rescued, and piled up in their place. The capitals and key-stones are richly carved, and the arches in the walls are beautifully proportioned. The porch of the chapter-house has been adorned with small marble columns, and at the entrance are Saxon arches with very deep cornices. Two similar arches, but of smaller dimensions, lead from the cloisters to the refectorium. Passing through the cloisters, of which only the skeleton remains, we entered the church under the great central tower, the lofty arches of which are yet standing. The eastern window is of vast dimensions, and its ornamental frame was anciently filled with painted glass, some of which still exists in the church of Bowness. In the wall at the right of the window are four stalls, with a fretted canopy, where the priests sat at intervals during the service of mass. The church forms the northern side of the building, but one of its walls, and both its rows of pillars, are gone. Their bases, which remain, show that the pillars were alternately round and clustered. Four statues of admirable workmanship, two of marble and two of stone, are shown to the visiter; one is in chain-armour, two others also in armour, and the fourth is a lady; they are in the recumbent posture, and have lain upon sepulcral monuments. Near the central tower are three chapels, with pavements of ornamented brick-work, and traces of altars. At the western end of the church is a winding staircase, still perfect, by which I ascended to the top of the building, whence there is an interesting view of the ruin. The best view of the Abbey is from the hill-side opposite the great eastern window, where you see the interior of the church,( through that window), the chapter-house, and indeed the whole pile from the north to the south, as well as from east to west. The head of Stephen, the founder of the Abbey, and that of Maud his queen, both crowned, are seen on the outside of the eastern window. As I was leaving the Abbey, a party of two ladies and a gentleman arrived for the purpose of sketching, and they coud not have had a finer day for the purpose. I could have lingered for hours, had my time permitted, amongst these relics of departed grandeur.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Abbey",18,23],["Bowness",2239,2246],["Abbey",3135,3140],["Abbey",3407,3412],["Abbey",3524,3529]],"geonouns":[["valley",114,120],["school",159,165],["house",166,171],["school",360,366],["house",367,372],["hall",591,595],["walls",670,675],["hall",714,718],["walls",801,806],["walls",880,885],["hall",1048,1052],["walls",1087,1092],["house",1289,1294],["building",1332,1340],["stones",1611,1617],["walls",1659,1664],["house",1720,1725],["entrance",1781,1789],["church",2005,2011],["tower",2036,2041],["church",2229,2235],["wall",2255,2259],["church",2394,2400],["building",2432,2440],["walls",2457,2462],["stone",2655,2660],["monuments",2829,2838],["tower",2857,2862],["chapels",2873,2880],["church",2971,2977],["winding",2983,2990],["top",3044,3047],["building",3055,3063],["hill",3153,3157],["church",3232,3238],["house",3275,3280],["head",3371,3375]],"pos_words":[["abundance",91,100],["perfect",258,265],["perfect",384,391],["spacious",582,590],["supporting",633,643],["restored",1108,1116],["proper",1258,1264],["sumptuous",1305,1314],["supported",1455,1464],["richly",1622,1628],["beautifully",1669,1680],["lead",1879,1883],["great",2022,2027],["right",2267,2272],["admirable",2607,2616],["work",2917,2921],["perfect",3008,3015],["interesting",3084,3095],["best",3118,3122],["great",3176,3181],["well",3340,3344],["finer",3636,3641],["grandeur",3752,3760]],"neg_words":[["deadly",63,69],["scarcely",483,491],["lost",857,861],["rubbish",992,999],["fell",1405,1409],["stalls",2296,2302],["ruin",3108,3112]],"events":[],"dates":[["A few years",691,702],["the middle of the",1419,1436],["last century",1437,1449],["day",3642,3645]],"times":[["hours",3689,3694]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["upwards",320,327],["there",3072,3077],["outside",3472,3479]],"spa_preps":[["over",464,468],["about",1413,1418],["through",1931,1938],["under",2012,2017],["round",2570,2575],["opposite",3163,3171],["through",3241,3248],["amongst",3719,3726]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0516129032,"vader_sentiment":1.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9960588217},{"para_id":423,"paragraph":"From the Abbey I returned to Dalton, and, half a mile beyond that place, quitted the Ulverston road and took the road through Urswick and Bardsen to Conishead Priory.

I began therefore to calculate whether it was practicable to proceed from Coniston Water to the head of Great Langdale, go up the mountain from that place, and afterwards ride to Ambleside in the evening. I found by the map that the ascent would be a long one, as Scawfell Pikes lay at a considerable distance from the head of Langdale, and another range of hills appeared to intervene. But I had not the least doubt of being able to accomplish it, if I should find a person to serve as a guide in climbing the mountain; which was somewhat doubtful, as I should come down into Langdale by a cross-road just at the head of the valley, where there were only two or three farmhouses. At Coniston Water Head I could find no one who had ever been on Scawfell Pikes, and indeed the natives of this country never ascend a mountain for pleasure; except, perhaps, on a hunting expedition, when the fox often betakes himself to the tops of the hills, and is followed thither by his eager pursuers.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Coniston Water",42,56],["Hawkshead",66,75],["Bowness",80,87],["Ambleside",91,100],["Old Man",163,170],["Scawfell",443,451],["Pikes",452,457],["England",483,490],["Coniston Water",648,662],["Great Langdale",678,692],["Ambleside",753,762],["Scawfell",838,846],["Pikes",847,852],["Langdale",901,909],["Langdale",1151,1159],["Coniston Water",1258,1272],["Scawfell",1319,1327],["Pikes",1328,1333]],"geonouns":[["foot",129,133],["mountain",147,155],["mountain",318,326],["valleys",383,390],["mountain",471,479],["head",670,674],["mountain",704,712],["head",893,897],["hills",932,937],["mountain",1085,1093],["road",1171,1175],["head",1188,1192],["valley",1200,1206],["country",1366,1373],["mountain",1389,1397],["hills",1508,1513]],"pos_words":[["fine",140,144],["easy",250,254],["top",309,312],["delightful",346,356],["accomplish",1008,1018],["pleasure",1402,1410],["tops",1496,1500],["eager",1546,1551]],"neg_words":[["doubt",985,990],["doubtful",1114,1122]],"events":[],"dates":[["the day",278,285]],"times":[["the morning",211,222],["the evening",766,777]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["there",1214,1219]],"spa_preps":[["out",239,242],["down",1141,1145],["into",1146,1150]],"normalised_sentiment":0.046875,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9976068735},{"para_id":433,"paragraph":"The only persons who know the mountainous tracts are the farmers' servants, who have to tend the sheep upon them; and they know scarcely any thing beyond their own sheep-walk: the next hill-side is to them a terra incognita.

About half - past eight o'clock on a hot and cloudless morning, I left Coniston Water Head, passed through delightful grounds of Mr. Knott, and found my way through a wood into the valley of Yewdale. This valley is probably so called from rows of yews which there is in the fields, clipped into stiff and odious forms, and which may be many centuries old; or from a single yew-tree in another part of the valley, which is remarkably tall and beautiful. I passed along under a range of stupendous crags, called Yewdale Crags, whose picturesque horros were rendered almost amiable by the bright illumination of the sun, and the tufts of fresh green which sparingly embossed the face of the precipices. I soon entered the valley of Tilberthwaite, where the fells on either side might be thought one mass of blue slate, from the great number of quarries made in them for its extraction. This material constitutes the riches of the valley, which is otherwise most barren and desolate. At Tilberthwaite I asked my way to Blea Tarn, and was directed to go over a considerable hill to my left, with the assurance that I could not miss my way, as there was\" nae ither gate.\" This assurance is very often given in these parts, and should always be taken with some grains of allowance. It does not mean in the absolute sense that there is no other road, but only that there is none which a man would be fool enought to take-- the informant always presuming that a traveller knows more about the roads than is generally the fact. It may be that there is one road to the right and another to the left; but the peasant, knowing that one of them leads only to a quarry, or to some place away from where the traveller wishes to go, concludes that he cannot possibly taken that, and therefore gives him no warning against it. Thus I found it in the present case, and I was obliged sometimes to trust to my own sagacity in choosing my route. The track is steep and rugged, but commands some fine views of the valley, in which the ruggedness of the crags and quarries is relieved by larch-forests of the most vivid green. The road comes down into Little Langdale at a farm called Fell Foot. It may be right to mention, that in inquiring for the farms of Wall End and Style End at the head of Great Langdale, the traveller would do well to ask for Wo End and Steeal End.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",176,185],["Coniston Water",273,287],["Yewdale",393,400],["Yewdale",712,719],["Crags",720,725],["Tilberthwaite",931,944],["Tilberthwaite",1185,1198],["Blea Tarn",1217,1226],["Little Langdale",2330,2345],["Great Langdale",2475,2489]],"geonouns":[["grounds",320,327],["wood",369,373],["valley",383,389],["valley",407,413],["fields",476,482],["tree",579,583],["valley",607,613],["crags",698,703],["precipices",890,900],["valley",921,927],["quarries",1043,1051],["valley",1129,1135],["hill",1271,1275],["gate",1361,1365],["road",1539,1543],["roads",1686,1691],["road",1748,1752],["quarry",1849,1855],["track",2130,2135],["valley",2193,2199],["crags",2232,2237],["quarries",2242,2250],["forests",2272,2279],["road",2309,2313],["farm",2351,2355],["farms",2428,2433],["head",2467,2471]],"pos_words":[["hot",239,242],["delightful",309,319],["remarkably",624,634],["beautiful",644,653],["stupendous",687,697],["picturesque",733,744],["amiable",773,780],["bright",788,794],["fresh",837,842],["great",1027,1032],["assurance",1297,1306],["assurance",1373,1382],["right",1760,1765],["leads",1833,1838],["trust",2079,2084],["sagacity",2095,2103],["fine",2175,2179],["vivid",2292,2297],["right",2384,2389],["well",2514,2518]],"neg_words":[["stiff",497,502],["barren",1161,1167],["desolate",1172,1180],["miss",1324,1328],["fool",1594,1598],["warning",1991,1998],["steep",2139,2144]],"events":[],"dates":[["many centuries",538,552]],"times":[["the evening",189,200],["About half - past eight o'clock",202,233],["morning",257,264]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["left",268,272],["there",460,465],["left",1282,1286],["there",1340,1345],["there",1521,1526],["there",1559,1564],["there",1735,1740],["left",1785,1789],["away",1874,1878]],"spa_preps":[["through",301,308],["through",359,366],["into",374,378],["into",492,496],["along",664,669],["under",670,675],["over",1251,1255],["about",1676,1681],["against",1999,2006],["down",2320,2324],["into",2325,2329]],"normalised_sentiment":0.056768559,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987128973},{"para_id":435,"paragraph":"At Foot Fell I entered Westmoreland, and, crossing the valley of Little Langdale, ascended a slack which conducts to Great Langdale.

The farmer here complained, like myself, that it was\" terrible het; I thought he applied the adjective\" terrible\" appropriately enough, if not grammatically, in this case, but I found that he made as indiscriminate a use of it as the French of their bien; for when I remarked that I had never ascended a mountain on a clearer day, he replied that it was\" terrible clear.\" A quarter of an hour more gave us a view of Windermere, opening out beyond the valley of Langdale, and enabled us to see, over the Stickle Pikes, the whole extent of the Borrowdale and Langdale fells, Helvellyn, Fairfield, and many other hills. Shortly after, we saw the lofty mountains of Grasmoor and Grisedale Pike, to the north. My guide undertook the ascent of the precipitous crags which form the forehead of Bowfell; and I had no difficulty in following him as he wound amongst them, though, looking at the place from below, I should have thought it madness to attempt scaling them. A stranger, indeed, could not have done it along without peril.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Langdale",226,234],["Borrowdale",239,249],["Stonethwaite",255,267],["Borrowdale",278,288],["Skiddaw",320,327],["Saddleback",332,342],["Langdale",418,426],["Pike",436,440],["Wrynose",453,460],["Wetherlam",497,506],["Ingleborough",614,626],["Windermere",1044,1054],["Langdale",1089,1097],["Pikes",1139,1144],["Borrowdale",1170,1180],["Langdale",1185,1193],["Helvellyn",1201,1210],["Fairfield",1212,1221],["Grasmoor",1290,1298],["Grisedale Pike",1303,1317],["Bowfell",1415,1422]],"geonouns":[["pike",137,141],["mountain",185,193],["pass",194,198],["pass",310,314],["ridge",519,524],["horizon",570,577],["head",606,610],["mountain",932,940],["valley",1079,1085],["hills",1238,1243],["mountains",1277,1286],["crags",1382,1387]],"pos_words":[["right",394,399],["like",656,660],["enough",756,762],["clear",992,997]],"neg_words":[["mistaken",597,605],["complained",644,654],["terrible",682,690],["terrible",732,740],["indiscriminate",828,842],["terrible",983,991],["precipitous",1370,1381],["difficulty",1437,1447],["wound",1471,1476],["madness",1557,1564],["stranger",1592,1600],["peril",1647,1652]],"events":[],"dates":[["a clearer day",944,957],["A quarter of an hour",1000,1020]],"times":[["an hour",25,32]],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",218,225],["here",639,643],["without",1639,1646]],"spa_preps":[["down",41,45],["above",163,168],["over",301,305],["beyond",343,349],["opposite",358,366],["down",413,417],["out",1064,1067],["beyond",1068,1074],["over",1122,1126],["amongst",1477,1484],["below",1525,1530],["along",1633,1638]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0579710145,"vader_sentiment":-0.94,"roberta_sentiment":0.996294558},{"para_id":440,"paragraph":"A half - past twelve, being a hour an three - quarters after leaving Style End, we found ourselves on the summit of Bowfell. The view was glorious, but the first objective we looked for gave us little comfort. Scawfell Pikes appeared at least as far from us as we were from the valley, and, though we were within two hundred and fifty feet of their elevation, many thousand feet of cruel rocks separated us from them. My guide's theory had been delusive, and it afforded another proof how defective a knowledge these men have of their own immediate neighbourhood. He had at different times tended sheep on Bowfell, Scawfell, and the surrounding hills, but there was a great want of combination in his knowledge: the plans of his sheep-walks lay in his head like separate portions of a dissecting map, which he could not put together. We had to descend many hundred feet, to make a long circuit, and then to re-ascend before reaching the point, an inch short of which I was determined not to rest. Whilst we were climbing the last and steepest part of Bowfell, and had been too much engaged in looking to our safety to observed any thing but the rocks around us, the sky had become completely overcast. My guide now prognosticated rain, but I suspected him of doing so from a wish to return; I thought it would still hold up, at least until we could reach Scawfell. In the south, there was a small ragged cloud hanging down from the rest over the Bay of Morecambe, and if the wind had changed to that direction, we were very likely to have rain. I held up my handkerchief to see the direction of the wind, but not a breath of air was stirring even at that elevation. Then the farmer talked about thunder: but as I observed that the clouds were still considerably higher than the mountain-tops, I slighted his evil auguries. However, no time was to be lost, and, after I had myself taken, and given to him, a taste of brandy, we prosecuted our enterprise. When we reached the top of Bowfell, we had so husbanded our strength, that I was as fresh as when I set out; but our apprehensions of the rain now made us push on with all our vigour, and our walk over the rocks and hill-tops was a severe effort till we reached the summit of our ambition. At the top of Bowfell we passed out of Westmoreland into Cumberland. We had first a long descent, in which we skirted the top of tremendous precipices, till we came to the slack called Ash Course, overlooking the head of Eskdale. Here I saw clearly the direction we ought to have taken, and which would have saved us a lnog ascent and descent. We now went up the east side of Great End, and, passing over the top, again descended a considerable distance. From this place to the top of the Pikes, the summits are composed of huge blocks of stone, just painted with the lichens which cleave to their weather-worn surfaces, and, except in one spot, with no other symptom of vegetation. The last ascent is very steep, but I climbed it with hearty good-will, as it placed me on the highest summit in England.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Bowfell",116,123],["Scawfell",210,218],["Pikes",219,224],["Bowfell",606,613],["Scawfell",615,623],["Bowfell",1051,1058],["Scawfell",1355,1363],["Morecambe,",1453,1463],["Bowfell",1981,1988],["Bowfell",2258,2265],["Westmoreland",2283,2295],["Cumberland",2301,2311],["Eskdale",2465,2472],["Great End",2620,2629],["Pikes",2733,2738],["England",3039,3046]],"geonouns":[["summit",106,112],["valley",278,284],["rocks",388,393],["hills",645,650],["head",752,756],["point",937,942],["rocks",1145,1150],["mountain",1778,1786],["top",1974,1977],["rocks",2160,2165],["hill",2170,2174],["summit",2220,2226],["top",2366,2369],["precipices",2384,2394],["head",2457,2461],["top",2653,2656],["top",2722,2725],["summits",2744,2751],["stone",2783,2788],["summit",3029,3035]],"pos_words":[["glorious",138,146],["comfort",201,208],["great",668,673],["like",757,761],["tops",1787,1791],["fresh",2038,2043],["tops",2175,2179],["top",2251,2254],["clearly",2485,2492],["good",2987,2991]],"neg_words":[["cruel",382,387],["defective",489,498],["ragged",1397,1403],["cloud",1404,1409],["evil",1808,1812],["lost",1850,1854],["apprehensions",2071,2084],["severe",2186,2192],["slack",2416,2421],["worn",2850,2854],["symptom",2904,2911],["steep",2951,2956]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["A half - past twelve",0,20],["a hour",28,34],["The last",2927,2935]],"distances":[["fifty feet",329,339],["many thousand feet",360,378],["many hundred feet",852,869]],"loc_advs":[["within",306,312],["there",656,661],["there",1379,1384]],"spa_preps":[["together",824,832],["around",1151,1157],["down",1418,1422],["over",1437,1441],["about",1689,1694],["out",2058,2061],["over",2151,2155],["out",2276,2279],["into",2296,2300],["over",2644,2648]],"normalised_sentiment":-0.0076628352,"vader_sentiment":0.98,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9982050657},{"para_id":441,"paragraph":"Scawfell Pikes command the best view of the mountainous region of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire, and perhaps a more extensive range of prospect beyond it than any other hill. Its central situation, as well as its height, give it in this advantage: it is midway between Skiddaw and Black Comb, and something more than midway betwixt Ullswater and the sea. Nearly all the great valleys branch off from Scawfell and Great Gavel, as Mr. Wordsworth has observed, like the spokes of a wheel from the axle. Here I became cicerone, and the farmer listened whilst I traced over the geography of the district. Looking northward, Sty Head with its tarn lay immediately beneath us, and I saw the spot at the top of the long descent into Wastdale, where George and I last year sat down to admire the sublime mountain on which I now stood. Borrowdale stretched away beyond, but was partly hid by Great End: from Ash Course we had had a view of the whole valley, and of the charming lake of Derwentwater with its islands. Skiddaw and Saddleback rose beyond, and betwixt the former and Grisedale Pike we saw, over the lake of Bassenthwaite, part of the level country, and faintly discerned Solway Frith; but the haze prevented us from seeing the Scotch mountains. Turning eastward, we saw Helvellyn and his range, High Street, Hill Bell, and the vast group of mountains which encompass Hawes Water. Langdale ran due east, and discharged itself into the vale of Windermere, but was hid from us by Bowfell. The head of Windermere and Esthwaite Water were visible, and the never-failing Ingleborough beyond them. Coniston Old Man, Wetherlam, Wrynose, and all that group, lay to the south-east. Immediately south is the summit of Scawfell, within about sixty feet of the elevation of the Pikes, and separated from them by the great chasm of Mickle Door. The beautiful vale of the Esk runs down on the left to the sea, and Donnerdale also conducts the eye to the broad mouth of the Duddon. Morecambe Bay and all the coast of Lancashire are seen due south; and, had the day been clearer, the Welsh mountains would have appeared in the extreme distance. Turning to the south-west, Black Comb came within view, and the wide expanse of the Irish sea swept round the horizon as far as the north-west, only broken in one part by the hills of the Isle of Man, which appeared over the foot of Wast Water. Deep, deep below us lay the\" Den of Wasdale,\" with its lake: beyond, apparently within arm's length, the rival height of Great Gavel, and, stretching to the left, the ridges of Kirkfell, Yewbarrow, Seatallan, the Hay Cock, and the Pillar, some of which excluded from our view the lake and vale of Ennnerdale. Proceeding northward, High Crag and High Stile, which rise over Buttermere, and Grasmoor and Grisedale Pike, on the east of Crummock Water, were proudly conspicuous; and from Great End we saw the foot of the last-mentioned lake.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Scawfell",0,8],["Pikes",9,14],["Cumberland",66,76],["Westmoreland",78,90],["Lancashire",96,106],["Skiddaw",280,287],["Black Comb",292,302],["Ullswater",343,352],["Scawfell",411,419],["Great Gavel",424,435],["Wordsworth",444,454],["Sty Head",630,638],["Wastdale",736,744],["George",752,758],["Borrowdale",837,847],["Great End",893,902],["Derwentwater",987,999],["Skiddaw",1018,1025],["Saddleback",1030,1040],["Grisedale Pike",1081,1095],["Bassenthwaite",1121,1134],["Solway Frith",1185,1197],["Helvellyn",1284,1293],["High Street",1309,1320],["Bell",1327,1331],["Hawes Water",1381,1392],["Langdale",1394,1402],["Windermere",1456,1466],["Bowfell",1491,1498],["Windermere",1512,1522],["Esthwaite Water",1527,1542],["Ingleborough",1579,1591],["Coniston",1605,1613],["Old Man",1614,1621],["Wetherlam",1623,1632],["Wrynose",1634,1641],["Scawfell",1721,1729],["Pikes",1779,1784],["Mickle Door",1832,1843],["Donnerdale",1913,1923],["Duddon",1972,1978],["Morecambe Bay",1980,1993],["Lancashire",2015,2025],["Black Comb",2169,2179],["Isle",2330,2334],["Wast Water",2375,2385],["Wasdale",2423,2430],["Great Gavel",2508,2519],["Kirkfell",2564,2572],["Yewbarrow",2574,2583],["Hay Cock",2600,2608],["Pillar",2618,2624],["High Crag",2718,2727],["High Stile",2732,2742],["Buttermere",2760,2770],["Grasmoor",2776,2784],["Grisedale Pike",2789,2803],["Crummock Water",2820,2834],["Great End",2871,2880]],"geonouns":[["region",56,62],["hill",180,184],["sea",361,364],["valleys",387,394],["district",601,609],["tarn",648,652],["mountain",806,814],["valley",951,957],["lake",979,983],["islands",1009,1016],["lake",1113,1117],["country",1154,1161],["mountains",1248,1257],["mountains",1355,1364],["vale",1448,1452],["head",1504,1508],["summit",1711,1717],["vale",1859,1863],["sea",1904,1907],["mouth",1959,1964],["coast",2006,2011],["mountains",2087,2096],["sea",2232,2235],["horizon",2252,2259],["hills",2317,2322],["foot",2367,2371],["lake",2442,2446],["ridges",2554,2560],["lake",2667,2671],["vale",2676,2680],["foot",2892,2896],["lake",2919,2923]],"pos_words":[["best",27,31],["well",212,216],["advantage",248,257],["great",381,386],["like",469,473],["top",707,710],["admire",787,793],["sublime",798,805],["charming",970,978],["great",1817,1822],["beautiful",1849,1858],["clearer",2068,2075]],"neg_words":[["haze",1207,1211],["failing",1571,1578],["broken",2291,2297],["rival",2492,2497],["conspicuous",2849,2860]],"events":[],"dates":[["last year",765,774],["the day",2055,2062],["the\"",2411,2415]],"times":[],"distances":[["about sixty feet",1738,1754]],"loc_advs":[["beyond",155,161],["northward",619,628],["beyond",1592,1598],["left",1892,1896],["within",2185,2191],["beyond",2448,2454],["within",2467,2473],["left",2544,2548],["northward",2707,2716]],"spa_preps":[["between",272,279],["over",575,579],["beneath",669,676],["into",731,735],["down",779,783],["away",858,862],["beyond",863,869],["beyond",1046,1052],["over",1104,1108],["into",1439,1443],["within",1731,1737],["down",1880,1884],["round",2242,2247],["over",2358,2362],["below",2398,2403],["over",2755,2759]],"normalised_sentiment":0.024911032,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987438321},{"para_id":442,"paragraph":"Though the day was now far from being\" terrible clear,\" we saw all these objects with distinctness.

We sat down under the shelter of the pile of stones erected on the highest Pike, and divided our sandwiches and brandy. The ascent had been made in three hours and five minutes, and we had lost fully half an hour by crossing Bowfell. Having seen in the progress of our ascent nearly all the objects which were visible from the summit, we did not tarry long to survey the entire panorama. The descent cost us an hour and fifty minutes, though we ran a good part of the way; but, being exceedingly thirsty, we often stopped to drink at the fresh streamlets. From Ash Course we kept to the left, and descended an easier path to the level of Angle Tarn, which lies at an awful depth beneath the precipitous summit of Bowfell. The descent into Langdale is by an excessively steep and savage gill, called Rosset gill, and when we reached the valley, we had to walk about a mile to the farmer's house. The route which we took in our return is that by which we ought to have ascended. The young farmer, though habituated to the mountains from his childhood, was nearly as much fatigued as myself by our five hours' walk. My shoes and stockings were soaked with water of the bogs we had crossed, and when I took them off to dry them, I found that my toes had lost some of their skin, from constant pressure against the shoe in coming down the hills: If my shoes had not been both strong and roomy, I should have suffered much more. The young and pretty wife of the farmer had spied us at a distance, and had prepared for us some eggs boiled as hard as stones, and tea, or rather warm water tinged with a spoonful of tea.

On the side of Troutbeck the mountains have a smooth swelling outline, and are clothed with a thick carpet of grass, on which many sheep are fed: but on the side of Kentmere the ridge shelves down abruptly in awful precipices, which have a terrific appearance to a person walking along the top. The head of Kentmere, indeed, is remarkably grand, from the amazing height of the mountain walls which stand round it. Along the side and over the summit of Hill Bell and High Street a green road may be traced, which is believed to be the line of an old Roman road from Kendal to Penrith. That it was a road in use when pack-horses were the chief mode of conveying goods, is certain. This, like many other old roads in England has been carried over the highest ground, evidently on the jealous principle of disturbed and warlike times, when it would have been unsafe to travel along the valleys, from the liability to be surprised and overpowered by an enemy in possession of the heights.

The neglect to do this cost us a round of many miles, and nearly occasioned our being benighted among the hills. It was after seven o'clock in the evening when we set out for Kentmere to cross the hill into Long Sleddale, a valley running parallel to that of Kentmere, and which seemed by the map to lead without any intervening hill to Mardale at the head of Hawes Water. When we came down into Long Sleddale the shades of evening were coming on, and we therefore pushed on vigorously, scarcely allowing ourselves time to admire the bold and craggy mountains which enclose the vale. We could not, however, but be struck with the vast crags of Crowbarrow on our right, which rear their enormous bulk perpendicularly from the vale. To our surprise we found that the valley ran up among the hills, without the outlet we had expected towards Mardale: and after toiling up a long ascent, we found ourselves on an elevated moor betwixt higher mountains, and not knowing which way to pursue. Two slacks appeared to lie before us, but still considerably above, one to the left and the other to the right. My impression was that Mardale lay to the right, but the track we were upon led up the hill to the left. It was now half - past nine, and darkness was coming on; we were several miles from any human habitation; there was little time to deliberate; we both mounted the horse, and urged him up the narrow and stony pathway, in hopes that we might reach the top of the slack before night had so far advanced as to prevent our seeing Hawes Water. The animal seemed to understand the emergency: he trotted briskly up a rugged ascent, pricking his ears, and snuffing up the wind. At length we reached the top of the slack,( which I afterwards found was caled Salset Brow) and the path began to descend: we looked down into a deep and narrow valley, at the head of which gloomy and awful precipices towered to a mountain-height: we could not see Hawes Water, but it was evidently our safest plan to proceed as rapidly as possible along the track, which must certainly conduct us to some habitation, either in Mardale or in another valley. We dismounted and ran down the hill, I leading the horse. we had not descended far, when, to our unspeakable relief and joy, we saw Hawes Water in the valley below us, which assured us that we were in the right road, and were near our place of rest for the night. It was now ten o'clock, and by half - past ten we reached the White Bull at Mardale Green. Mr. Thomas Lambley, the host, had retired to bed, but we roused the family, and obtained supper and comfortable accommodation for the night, both for our good horse and ourselves.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Kentmere",92,100],["Mardale",275,282],["Kentmere",459,467],["Kentmere",543,551],["Mardale",621,628],["Hawes Water",644,655],["Crowbarrow",928,938],["Mardale",1123,1130],["Mardale",1405,1412],["Hawes Water",1812,1823],["Hawes Water",2221,2232],["Mardale",2384,2391],["Hawes Water",2546,2557],["Mardale Green",2754,2767]],"geonouns":[["country",32,39],["mountains",156,165],["hills",390,395],["hill",481,485],["valley",508,514],["hill",613,617],["head",636,640],["mountains",834,843],["vale",862,866],["crags",919,924],["vale",1009,1013],["valley",1049,1055],["hills",1073,1078],["outlet",1092,1098],["moor",1202,1206],["mountains",1222,1231],["track",1439,1444],["hill",1469,1473],["top",1981,1984],["path",2056,2060],["valley",2117,2123],["head",2132,2136],["precipices",2163,2173],["mountain",2187,2195],["track",2315,2320],["valley",2406,2412],["hill",2445,2449],["valley",2565,2571],["road",2625,2629],["bed",2814,2817]],"pos_words":[["best",45,49],["lead",584,588],["admire",807,813],["right",946,951],["right",1375,1380],["right",1424,1429],["led",1458,1461],["top",1737,1740],["advanced",1778,1786],["leading",2453,2460],["relief",2523,2529],["joy",2534,2537],["right",2619,2624],["comfortable",2869,2880],["good",2923,2927]],"neg_words":[["steep",240,245],["neglect",288,295],["scarcely",771,779],["struck",898,904],["lie",1293,1296],["darkness",1520,1528],["slack",1748,1753],["emergency",1861,1870],["slack",1992,1997],["gloomy",2146,2152],["awful",2157,2162],["unspeakable",2511,2522]],"events":[],"dates":[["half - past",2709,2720]],"times":[["an appointed hour",187,204],["seven o'clock",410,423],["the evening",427,438],["evening",708,715],["half - past nine",1498,1514],["night",1761,1766],["the night",2667,2676],["ten o'clock",2689,2700],["the night",2899,2908]],"distances":[["several miles",1552,1565]],"loc_advs":[["there",178,183],["without",589,596],["without",1080,1087],["above",1331,1336],["left",1349,1353],["left",1481,1485],["there",1593,1598]],"spa_preps":[["down",231,235],["into",270,274],["round",317,322],["among",380,385],["out",451,454],["into",486,490],["down",670,674],["into",675,679],["among",1063,1068],["down",2089,2093],["into",2094,2098],["along",2305,2310],["down",2436,2440],["below",2572,2577],["near",2640,2644]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0113207547,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9984989166},{"para_id":474,"paragraph":"I have mentioned these particulars as a warning to the future rambler not to judge the distance he has to travel and the difficulties he has to conquer merely by the map, but always to obtain the fullest information possible from persons acquainted with the country.

I had now lost sight of Wythburn, from having passed over the brow of the hill which overlooks the valley, and had got upon the heath-covered, boggy, and rocky moor that lies between that valley and Watendlath. But I had by no means attained the highest part which I had to cross; so that when the clouds began to tip the fell on my left, my coolness and sentimentalizing soon left me, and I knew it was my business to posh on as fast as much legs could carry me, in order to get a peep at Watendlath ere the clouds descended. The rain began to fall smartly: the clouds lowered, but happily not fast. I had seen the old ruined wall which the good citizen of Wythburn directed me to look for, and at length I reached it, after tasting of several bogs, though I kept as much as possible along the rocky ridges which cross the moor. To be in a hurry among the long heath, bogs, and rocks, is no enviable thing.

I therefore made all the haste I could to reach Harrison Stickle, which was still occasionally clear, and in twenty - five minutes more I sat down on his sublime throne. The view was not only transcendantly grand, but, from the clouds struggling with the sunshine on the elevated ranges of hills, it was of a most peculiar character. The tops of the high mountains, as Helvellyn, Fairfield, and Bowfell, were cut off by the clouds; but immediately beneath the stratum of vapour, through occasional openings, there poured in floods of sun-beams, which illuminated large portions of the mountains; and as the wind carried about the clouds, there was a continual shifting of light and shadow in vast masses, alternately revealing and shrouding hills and crags, like a phantasmagoria. It was a scene at once fascinating and wonderful. Whilst on Harrison Stickle the clouds were several times far beneath me, but they were so transparent, that I could see Windermere and most other distant objects through them. At a fearful depth beneath the summit lies the Stickle Tarn on one side, with stupendous precipices of Pavey Ark skirting it, and at the other side the more awful depth of Great Langdale.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Langdale",19,27],["Pike",101,105],["Harrison Stickle",201,217],["Pike",326,330],["Harrison Stickle",608,624],["Helvellyn",929,938],["Fairfield",940,949],["Bowfell",955,962],["Harrison Stickle",1401,1417],["Windermere",1511,1521],["Stickle Tarn",1614,1626],["Great Langdale",1739,1753]],"geonouns":[["top",90,93],["point",124,129],["head",413,417],["hill",449,453],["top",454,457],["precipices",548,558],["hills",850,855],["mountains",915,924],["mountains",1145,1154],["hills",1301,1306],["crags",1311,1316],["summit",1598,1604],["precipices",1656,1666]],"pos_words":[["enough",31,37],["good",58,62],["sharp",116,121],["clear",655,660],["sublime",714,721],["grand",767,772],["tops",898,902],["like",1318,1322],["fascinating",1364,1375],["wonderful",1380,1389],["transparent",1481,1492],["stupendous",1645,1655]],"neg_words":[["frightful",538,547],["haste",585,590],["struggling",795,805],["peculiar",874,882],["fearful",1572,1579],["lies",1605,1609],["awful",1724,1729]],"events":[],"dates":[],"times":[["a few moments",186,199],["twenty - five minutes",669,690]],"distances":[["four hundred feet",284,301]],"loc_advs":[["here",181,185],["beneath",1008,1015],["there",1068,1073],["there",1198,1203]],"spa_preps":[["down",9,13],["into",14,18],["down",702,706],["through",1039,1046],["about",1180,1185],["beneath",1452,1459],["through",1553,1560],["beneath",1586,1593]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0328947368,"vader_sentiment":0.9,"roberta_sentiment":-0.9978296161},{"para_id":524,"paragraph":"The view from the Pikes is very extensive.

On the summit of the hill is the castle, a majestic structure, originally built by Roger de Poictou, in the 11th century, and re-edified by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, in the 14th. It has been repaired and greatly enlarged in modern times, and now serves as the county gaol; it is one of the most secure and best regulated prisons in the kingdom. The Assizes are held in the castle, and the Nisi Prius Court is a spacious and beautiful Gothic hall. The parish church of St Mary's, an ancient strcture with a lofty tower, stands on the castle-hill; it consists of a nave and two side-aisles, and contains some curious monuments and specimens of antiquity. There are several other episcopal and dissenting places of worship in the town. The principal public buildings are, the town-hall, in the Market Place; the theatre. The County Lunatic Asylum, on Lancaster Moor, a mile to the east of the town, is a handsome building, capable of accommodating 300 patients: it is near the race-course. The workhouse is in a commanding situation on the Lancaster side of the same hill. The foreign commerce of Lancaster, though very considerable thirty years since, is now much circumscribed, having been injured by the competition of Liverpool. The navigation of the Lune is difficult at neap tides, in consequence of the sand-banks; and the larger ships generally unload at Glasson Dock, distant five miles from the town. Lancaster is connected with the principal towns of the country by a canal ninety miles in length, which is carried over the Lune, a mile from the town, by a magnificent aqueduct of five arches, erected by the late Mr. Rennie. In consequence of the recent communication made between this canal and Glasson Dock, and of the erection of large warehouses at the latter place for ther reception of grain and other commodities, a great part of the Irish trade of Kendal and Preston canal, and the trade is annually increasing. Packet boats of a new construction, very long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, are drawn on these canals by horses at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, and form a cheap and pleasant mode of travelling. A steam-packet passes weekly, and frequently twice a week, between Lancaster and Liverpool, and conveys both passengers and goods; but it is irregular in the day sof departure. The principal manufactures are, mahogany furniture, cordage, sail cloth, cotton goods, candles, hats,&amp; c. The new bridge is a fine structure of five arches. There is a salmon fishery in the Lune, which has of late years been much less productive than formerly. Lancaster is incorporated under a mayor, aldermen,&amp; c., and sends two representatives to parliament. It is a great thoroughfare, and has numerous stage-coaches.

It is siuated in a very agreeable valley, beneath a lofty scar or cliff, which rises over the west side of the town. On the opposite side of the river are the remains of the ancient castle, situated on a considerable elevation, and commanding a beautiful prospect: the castle formerly belonged to the family of Parr, and Catherine, the last Queen of Henry Viii. was born there. On the western side of the town is an artificial mound, called the Castlelaw Hill, on which the inhabitants, in 1788, erected an obelisk to commemorate the glorious revolution of 1688. The church is a spacious Gothic structure, and has three chapels, memorials of the ancient dignity of three neighbouring families, the Bellinghams, Stricklands, and Parrs. There are several other places of worship in the town. Besides the public buildings of long standing, are recently erected the White Hall, in Lowther Street, a large handsome building: a handsome structure, situate in Highgate, for the purpose of carrying on the concerns of the Westmoreland Joint Stock Bank; and near Abbot Hall gates, an imposing building in the Gothic style, for the residence of a limited number of spinsters. Kendal has long been famous for a manufacture of coarse woolens, called Kendal cottons, linseys, serges, druggets, hats, leather, and especially of knit worsted stockings. The manufacture of these articles has, however, of late years greatly declined, and they have been succeeded by finer manufactures, principally of fancy waistcoatings. The trade of the town is facilitated by its canal communication with the principal rivers and towns of Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the centre and south of England. It is a great throughfare to the north, and most of the visiters to the Lakes pass through the town. Kendal is a corporate town, governed by a mayor, 12 aldermen, and 20 capital burgesses. It received the right of sending one member to parliament under the Reform Act, and its first member was James Brougham, Esq., on whose death John Barham, Esq., was elected.

At the ebb of the tide, the shores of Morecambe Bay are left dry to the extent of several miles from land; and, the sands being very firm, it is common to pass over them in going from Lancaster to Ulverston, as this route is 15 miles shorter than that by Milnthorpe and Newby Bridge. The tract varies, as the channel formed by the sea is sometimes nearer and sometimes further from the shore: in June, 1828, and for some months previous, the track was 11 miles in length, though it is frequently not more than 9, and sometimes only 7. The principal danger is in crossing the rivers Keer and Kent, which run over the sands to the sea; and here, therefore, Guides are stationed,( appointed by the Duchy of Lancaster) whose duty it is to conduct travellers safely across the rivers. The guides receive a small stipend, but it is customary for travellers to give them a few pence. The guide at the Keer is on foot, as the river is very shallow; at the Kent the guide is on horseback, the river being considerably wider and deeper. The latter has obtained the name of the Carter, the duties of the guide having been performed by a family of that name for many generations. The sands can only be crossed when the tide is out, and should never be attempted without the guides: at high water the track is covered by from 9 to 19 feet of water. A coach formerly passed over the sands, between Lancaster and Ulverston, but the sands having become increasingly dangerous, it was discontinued. The views here are extremely fine, comprising the whole coast of the bay of Morecambe, Pile Castle at its entrance, the bold crags of Warton and Arnside Fells on the right, Ingleborough to the east, the finely broken and wooden shores of the Kent, and a noble range of the Westmoreland and Cumberland mountains. -- Arnside Tower, once a mansion of the Stanleys, is seen under the fells of that name; and Castlehead, the elegant seat of the late John Wilkinson, Esq.( now of Robert Wright, Esq.) at the pyramidal hill, three miles above Kent's Bank, on the western shore.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Lancaster Sands",0,15],["Morecambe Bay",55,68],["Lancaster",201,210],["Ulverston",214,223],["Newby Bridge",287,299],["Kent",608,612],["Lancaster",721,730],["Kent",965,969],["Lancaster",1401,1410],["Ulverston",1415,1424],["Morecambe,",1575,1585],["Castle",1591,1597],["Warton",1633,1639],["Arnside",1644,1651],["Ingleborough",1672,1684],["Kent",1741,1745],["Westmoreland",1772,1784],["Cumberland",1789,1799],["Arnside",1814,1821],["Castlehead",1903,1913],["Kent",2035,2039]],"geonouns":[["shores",45,51],["land",118,122],["sands",133,138],["common",162,168],["pass",172,176],["channel",326,333],["sea",348,351],["shore",403,408],["track",459,464],["rivers",592,598],["sands",633,638],["sea",646,649],["rivers",789,795],["foot",922,926],["river",935,940],["river",1001,1006],["sands",1189,1194],["water",1295,1300],["track",1305,1310],["water",1346,1351],["coach",1355,1360],["sands",1386,1391],["sands",1434,1439],["coast",1555,1560],["bay",1568,1571],["entrance",1605,1613],["crags",1624,1629],["shores",1727,1733],["mountains",1800,1809],["mansion",1836,1843],["seat",1927,1931],["hill",2011,2015],["shore",2063,2068]],"pos_words":[["safely",771,777],["fine",1528,1532],["right",1665,1670],["finely",1702,1708],["noble",1753,1758],["elegant",1919,1926]],"neg_words":[["danger",566,572],["shallow",949,956],["dangerous",1467,1476],["discontinued",1485,1497],["broken",1709,1715]],"events":[],"dates":[["June, 1828",413,423],["some months previous",433,453],["9",527,528],["7",549,550]],"times":[],"distances":[["several miles",99,112],["15 miles",242,250],["11 miles",469,477],["9 to 19 feet",1330,1342],["three miles",2017,2028]],"loc_advs":[["left",73,77],["here",655,659],["across",778,784],["without",1267,1274],["here",1509,1513],["above",2029,2034]],"spa_preps":[["over",177,181],["over",624,628],["out",1232,1235],["over",1377,1381],["between",1393,1400],["under",1869,1874]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0054347826,"vader_sentiment":0.7,"roberta_sentiment":0.995551765},{"para_id":582,"paragraph":"Kent's Bank; 2 miles on the r.

The lake is principally fed by the rivers Brathay and Rothay, which fall into it at the head, and by the stream of Troutbeck, on the eastern side: its waters discharge themselves by the Leven at Newby Bridge. Windermere is adorned with no less than fourteen islands, called holms, the largest of which is Belle Isle, near the centre of the lake, opposite Bowness. It contains thirty acres, and was beautifully laid out in groves, lawns, and walks, by the late John Christian Curwen, Esq., who also built a handsome house upon it, in which his son, Henry C. Curwen, Esq. the present proprietor, resides. The lake abounds in trout, perch, pike, and char, the last being a rare and delicate fish, found only in the deepest of the lakes. Many handsome villas have been built on the shores, and the groves and pleasure-grounds attached to them add to the natural elegance of the scenery. The whole of the western shore of Windermere, and nearly half of the eastern, are in Lancashire, but the lake is considered to belong to Westmoreland.

The finest is the Langdale Excursion, and parts of it may be taken in a carriage, but it is not uncommon to perform the whole excursion in carts. The traveller may proceed first to Skelwith Bridge, 3 miles, a little above which is the cascade of Skelwith Force; then, but a road which commands a fine view of Elterwater and Great Langdale, he may proceed to Colwith Bridge, above which is the waterfall of Colwith Force, 5 miles from Ambleside. Then, proceeding up Little Langdale, nearly three miles, he may turn to the right over a slack, in which lies Blea Tarn. Descending the hill to the head of Great Langdale, the Langdale Pikes appear before him, and Bowfell on his left, in the utmost sublimity. The conical pike is called Pike o' Stickle, and the broad-headed pike Harrison Stickle. He will come into Great Langdale at the farm house of Wall End, whence he might either ascend Bowfell, or pass the Stake into Borrowdale; but the regular excursion will bring him down the valley to Mill Beck, where he may see the curious waterfall of Dungeon Gill. Still descending the valley, he may turn to the left when he comes in view of Elterwater, and cross the hill by High Close to Grasmere, enjoying splendid views of Windermere and Langdale on one side, and of the lake and vale of Grasmere on the other. A road which leaves Grasmere and Rydal Lakes on the left will bring him back to Ambleside. This forms a circuit of eighteen miles; but many content themselves with going to Skelwith Force, and then crossing Great Langdale, and passing over into Grasmere. Coniston Water, Hawkshead, and Bowness, may also be visited from Ambleside. Some pass over Kirkstone to Patterdale, at the head of Ullswater, 10 m.; but this is not the best way of seeing that noble lake. There are also mountain excursions to Rydal Head, Fairfield, and to Wansfell Pike, which present very fine and extensive views.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",50,59],["Langdale",79,87],["Skelwith Bridge",242,257],["Skelwith",307,315],["Elterwater",370,380],["Great Langdale",385,399],["Colwith Bridge",419,433],["Colwith Force",467,480],["Ambleside",495,504],["Little Langdale",526,541],["Blea Tarn",616,625],["Great Langdale",662,676],["Langdale Pikes",682,696],["Bowfell",720,727],["Pike",793,797],["Harrison Stickle",836,852],["Great Langdale",872,886],["Bowfell",948,955],["Stake",969,974],["Borrowdale",980,990],["Mill Beck",1052,1061],["Dungeon Gill",1105,1117],["Elterwater",1197,1207],["High Close",1231,1241],["Grasmere",1245,1253],["Windermere",1282,1292],["Langdale",1297,1305],["Grasmere",1347,1355],["Grasmere",1390,1398],["Rydal",1403,1408],["Lakes",1409,1414],["Ambleside",1450,1459],["Skelwith",1543,1551],["Great Langdale",1577,1591],["Grasmere",1615,1623],["Coniston Water",1625,1639],["Hawkshead",1641,1650],["Bowness",1656,1663],["Ambleside",1690,1699],["Kirkstone",1716,1725],["Patterdale",1729,1739],["Ullswater",1756,1765],["Rydal Head",1868,1878],["Fairfield",1880,1889],["Wansfell Pike",1898,1911]],"geonouns":[["carriage",133,141],["road",335,339],["waterfall",454,463],["hill",642,646],["head",654,658],["pike",778,782],["pike",831,835],["farm",894,898],["house",899,904],["pass",960,964],["valley",1042,1048],["waterfall",1092,1101],["valley",1140,1146],["hill",1223,1227],["lake",1330,1334],["vale",1339,1343],["road",1372,1376],["pass",1706,1710],["head",1748,1752],["lake",1824,1828],["mountain",1845,1853]],"pos_words":[["interesting",10,21],["finest",65,71],["right",582,587],["enjoying",1255,1263],["splendid",1264,1272],["best",1794,1798],["noble",1818,1823],["fine",1932,1936]],"neg_words":[["slack",595,600],["lies",611,615]],"events":[],"dates":[["a fine",355,361]],"times":[],"distances":[["3 miles",259,266],["5 miles",482,489],["nearly three miles",543,561],["eighteen miles",1485,1499]],"loc_advs":[["above",277,282],["left",735,739],["left",1167,1171],["left",1422,1426]],"spa_preps":[["above",435,440],["over",588,592],["into",867,871],["into",975,979],["down",1033,1037],["over",1605,1609],["into",1610,1614],["over",1711,1715]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0320855615,"vader_sentiment":0.99,"roberta_sentiment":0.9983704686},{"para_id":637,"paragraph":"Ambleside to Keswick, 16 \u00bc m.","file_id":"1829_a","plnames":[["Ambleside",0,9],["Keswick",13,20]],"geonouns":[],"pos_words":[],"neg_words":[],"events":[],"dates":[["16",22,24]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[],"spa_preps":[],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.0,"roberta_sentiment":0.9957634211},{"para_id":638,"paragraph":"From Ambleside.

It is situated on a bay, and the harbour has been greatly improved by art: the town is built with uncommon regularity, the streets are spacious and the houses neat. The Earl of Lonsdale, who is lord of the manor and the proprietor of the coal-mines, has a commodious residence here, called the Castle, where there are some fine paintings. The harbour is large and convenient, and sheltered with several stone piers: one of them the new west pier, forms a most delightful promenade, and is as splendid a piece of masonry as the country can boast of. The plan was furnished by Sir John Rennie, and the work constructed under his super-intendence. There are light-houses both at the extremity of the old quay, near the entrance of the inner harbour, and at the extremity of the new west pier. The light-house on the new quay is now used as a station, on which the half - tide flag, as it is termed, is exhibited. This flag is hoisted every tide as soon as there is sufficient water for ordinary sized vessels to enter the inner harbour, which is about half flood, and lowered again when the harbour is not accessible, which is about half ebb. This harbour is still being further improved: an extensive pier is at present in the course of erection on the north side of the harbour, under the same distinguished engineer who projected the west pier. There are three churches in the town-- St. Nichols, the Holy Trinity, and St. James; a Scotch church, several dissenting meeting houses, and a handsome theatre. The coal mines are very extensive, and some of them not less than 310 yards in depth. They extend in various directions under the town and harbour, and the workings from more than one of the pits extend to a distance of more than a mile in a direct line under the sea. Upwards of 150,000 chaldrons of coals are said to be annually exported from these collieries, chiefly to Ireland, exclusive to the home consumption. There are not less than half a dozen ship building yards at this place, which has long enjoyed a high character for the fine model and faithful construction of the vessels built at it. There are three roperies, and until of late years a considerable quantity of sail-cloth was manufactured here: latterly, however, the business in this particular department has very much declined. There is also an extensive earthenware manufacture at Whitehaven. Four miles south of Whitehaven is St. Bees, celebrated for its ruined priory, and its grammar school, and in modern times for its clerical institution, or college. There are steam packets twice weekly between Liverpool and Whitehaven, which leave the former place about the time of high water, and reach Whitehaven the succeeding flow, not unfrequently completely the voyage in from eight to ten hours. These packets are commodiously fitted up for passengers; and a traveller by this conveyance proceeds from Liverpool to within 27 miles of the capital of the lake district-- but to within half that distance of some as fine lake and mountain scenery as the country can boast of-- for a few shillings, a distance of nearly one hundred and fity miles by land.

It is situated in a wide and fertile valley, a mile from the confluence of the Eamont and the Lowther. It is a great throughfare, being on the road from Glasgow and Carlisle to the south, and many visiters to the Lakes approach them in this direction. Penrith and the neighbourhood abound in objects of antiquarian curiosity. The church was rebuilt in 1722, and connected with the ancient tower. In the church-yard is a monument of great antiquity, called the Giant's Grave, or Giant's Legs, consisting of two stone pillars, about 10 feet high and 13 feet apart, and four large semi-circular stones, two on each side of the grave, imbedded in the earth. The pillars are rudely carved, and a cross is said to be distinguishable on each. Tradition avers that this is the tomb of Sir Ewan or Hugh Caesarius, a warrior of gigantic size, who reigned in this country in the time of Ida, one of the Saxon kings. At some distance is another stone pillar, six feet high, which, though not apparently connected with the grave, bears the name of the Giant's Thumb. The remains of the Castle stand on an elevation at the west side of the town. This was formerly a place of strength, was built about the reign of Edward Iv. and dismantled in the time of the Commonwealth. It belongs, with the honour on Penrith, to the Duke of Devonshire. A mile from the town, on a hill which commands a splendid prospect of the vale and the Westmoreland and Cumberland mountains, is the Beacon, the property of the Earl of Lonsdale, a lofty stone building, erected in the times of frequent hostility between England and Scotland. Brougham Castle, a majestic ruin, which Camden supposes to be on the site of the Roman station Brovoniacum, stands on the south of the rivers Eamont and Lowther, at their confluence. This was anciently the seat of the Veteriponts, and from them descended to the Cliffords and Tuftons: it still belongs to the Earl of Thanet, hereditary high-sheriff of Westmoreland. The traces of a Roman encampment are distinctly visible, and the present high road here takes the line of the ancient Roman road. -- Between the Eamont and the Lowther is a curious relic of British antiquity, called Arthur's Round Table; is is a circular grass-grown area, 29 yards in diameter, surrounded by a broad ditch and an elevated mound, with two approaches cut through the mound, opposite each other. It is believed to have been an arena for tournaments in the days of chivalry, and some antiquarians suppose it to have been originally a castrensian amphitheatre of Roman construction. -- A few hundred yards to the west of the Round Table, is an elevation, called Maybury, or Maybrough, on which is a circular enclosure, 100 yards is diameter, made by a broad ridge of pebble stones heaped up to the hight of 12 or 15 feet; in the centre of the circle is a massive pillar of unhewn stone, 11 feet high, and in one part 22 feet in circumference. This is believed to have been a place of Druidical judicature. -- A much finer relic of Druidical times is the monument called Long Meg and her Daughters, on the summit of a hill near Little Salkeld, six miles north-east of Penrith, which is a circle of three hundred and fifty yards in circumference, formed by 67 stones, many of which are 10 feet high, with one at the entrance 18 feet high.

They comprise 1800 acres, and are divided into three parks-- Glencoin Park, Gowbarrow Park, and the Low Park; the first and last of which are farmed off. Gowbarrow Park comprises 800 acres, and feeds 400 head of deer. Lyulph's Tower is the gatekeeper.

Branching off from it, on the right, are the valleys of Glenridden and Grisedale. At the head of the lake is a comfortable inn, the King's Arms, Mr. Wilson's, where post horses may be had, and whence a rough carriage road of ten miles conducts, by Brothers Water and over Kirkstone Moor, to Ambleside. Above the inn is an extremely fine echo: a cannon being fired, the peal is returned on the ear six or seven times with great distinctness from the surrounding mountains.

It stands on a gentle elevation at the confluence of the Eden, the Caldew, and the Peteril, within eight miles of the Scottish frontier, and is surrounded by a fertile and open country. Carlisle was a Roman station, and is within a quarter of a mile of the great Roman wall. It was anciently fortified, and in the wars between England and Scotland was a place of importance. Since the Union, it has greatly increased in trade and population. The streets are clean, and some of them very spacious and well-built. The castle is of unknown antiquity, but is said to have been built A. D. 680: some very massive and antique buttresses on the north battery are ascribed to William Rufus: it is still kept in a defensible state, having been lately repaired, and has a small garrison. Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1568, and the rooms she occupied, as well as her promenade, are shown. The cathedral is a venerable structure, partly of Saxon and partly of Gothic architecture: the east window is the largest in the kingdom: some old wooden screens in the aisles contain curious and ridiculous legendary paintings, representing events in the lives of St. Augustin and St. Anthony. The new gaol is an extensive and admirable building, situated at the southern entrance of the city, immediately contiguous to the county court-houses,( built in 1812) the principal features of which are two magnificent circular towers, the successors of two similar towers which in other days formed the defences of the\" English Gate.\" The bridge over the Eden was finished in 1817, and is a solid and elegant structure, a quarter of a mile in length. A new bridge has been thrown over the Peteril at the south entrance to the town, and the hills on each side lowered thirty feet. Two churches in the Gothic style have recently been erected, and a County Infirmary has been completed at the head of English Street. A News Room, Reading and Billiard Rooms, have also been built, from Gothic design by Messrs. Rickman and Hutchinson, of Birmingham, which contribute much to beautify the town. Carlisle has a flourishing manufacture of cottons, and also manufactures of woollens, linen, leather, and other articles: it is particularly celebrated for its whips and hats. Being within a few miles of the Solway, and having a ship canal to Bowness, its communications with Liverpool and all other parts are much facilitated by the steam-packets. A railway is commenced from this place to Newcastle, which may be expected still further to increase the prosperity of Carlisle. The city sends two representatives to Parliament, who at present are William James, Esq., of Barrock Lodge, and Philip Henry Howard, Esq. of Corby Castle. The county of Cumberland returns four members; at present the Right Hon. Sir James R. G. Graham, Bart., of Netherby,( lately First Lord of the Admiralty,) and Wm. Blamire, Esq., of Thackwoodnock, are Members for East Cumberland; and Samuel Irton, Esq., of Irton Hall, and Edward Stanley, Esq. of Ponsonby Hall, are the Members for West Cumberland.
