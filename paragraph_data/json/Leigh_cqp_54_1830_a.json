It contains about thirty - six acres, and is surrounded by a gravel walk nearly 2 miles in circumference, on which strangers are allowed to walk. Its form is oblong; its shores irregular, retiring into bays, and broken into creeks. The surface, too, is uneven; and a small ridge runs through the middle, falling down in all shapes into the water. The mansion is a handsome building, begun by Mr. English, a former proprietor of the island, and completed by Mr. Curwen. It commands a view of the whole lake, and is surrounded by noble trees and shrubberies. At the landing-place is a neat boat-house. Nothing can exceed the variety of scenery presented to the eye in a walk round this delightful island, and no tourist who is in search of the picturesque should omit to visit it. Mr. Housman thus describes the views obtained from the North and South sides of the island. \" The Northern shores afford a mixed prospect of the beautiful and sublime; a number of scattered islands interrupt the line of uniformity, which would otherwise bound a reach of the lake four miles and a half in length, and in some parts above one in breadth. These islands, in shape and clothing, display a pleasing variety in the foreground of the picture. The side screens are different; that on the left consists of a rocky ridge, descending to the water, partly covered with verdure, on which flocks of mountain sheep are seen feeding, and partly clothed with thick woods, or scattered with straggling trees and evergreen shrubs, over which the heights of Furness Fells are peeping into the lake. On the right, neat villages and farms, half buried in wood, form a delightful mixture of woodland and cultivated fields, stretching, in a gradual ascent, from the water's edge to the tops of some of the hills. In front, we have a large collection of high mountains, with pointed summits, rearing up in different attitudes, and one overlooking the top of another, as if anxious to gaze on the beauties of the lake.

Near the Woolen Mill is an old summer-house once belonging to Ambleside Hall, the ancient family seat of the Braithwaites, which stood in Ambleside at the junction of the Keswick and Penrith roads. It stands upon a bridge crossing the river, and forms a very picturesque object. A corn mill adjoins the bridge, and between it and the summer-house is a bark mill. This part of the river is called Rattle Gill, probably on account of the turbulence of its waters in wet weather.","file_id":"1830_a","plnames":[["Wansfell Pike",903,916],["Langdale Pikes",989,1003],["Ambleside",1086,1095],["Ambleside",1162,1171],["Keswick",1195,1202],["Penrith",1207,1214]],"geonouns":[["river",112,117],["landscape",206,215],["stream",233,239],["bed",252,255],["rocks",277,282],["stones",287,293],["water",364,369],["falls",370,375],["channel",409,416],["water",422,427],["crag",488,492],["channel",546,553],["rocks",595,600],["gill",665,669],["banks",740,745],["rocks",766,771],["woods",784,789],["rocks",826,831],["river",974,979],["house",1062,1067],["seat",1121,1125],["junction",1179,1187],["roads",1215,1220],["bridge",1239,1245],["river",1259,1264],["bridge",1327,1333],["house",1365,1370],["river",1404,1409],["waters",1478,1484]],"pos_words":[["delight",53,60],["excellent",134,143],["rich",160,164],["transparent",221,232],["finest",263,269],["variety",341,348],["gentle",558,564],["smooth",588,594],["beauty",617,623],["picturesque",1283,1294]],"neg_words":[["inequalities",310,322],["confined",388,396],["impatient",429,438],["resistance",442,452],["impetuously",461,472],["steep",482,487],["swelling",698,706],["steep",723,728],["wild",794,798],["object",1295,1301]],"events":[],"dates":[["summer",1055,1061],["the summer",1354,1364]],"times":[],"distances":[],"loc_advs":[["between",1339,1346]],"spa_preps":[["between",10,17],["over",245,249],["down",473,477],["over",579,583],["into",612,616],["through",938,945],["down",1015,1019]],"normalised_sentiment":0.0,"vader_sentiment":0.97,"roberta_sentiment":0.9987990856},{"para_id":164,"paragraph":"Scandale Beck, which crosses the Keswick road, at Scandale Bridge, about half a mile from Ambleside, is a rivulet which rises between Scandale Fell and High Pike, and forms numerous pretty water-falls in its course to the Rothay.
